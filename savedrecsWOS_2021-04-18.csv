C.",,,Estimated flows and biomass in a no-take coral reef from the eastern tropical Pacific through network analysis,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the southern Gulf of California, the Cabo Pulmo reef has been the focus of many studies because it is the northern-most coral reef in the eastern Pacific. It is a paragon of a well-managed marine protected area. Under the assumption that fishing mortality is negligible, we want to identify and quantify major energy flows in an ecosystem without human intervention and describe the ecosystem resources and their interactions among species, to provide a tool for ecosystem-based management. We built a trophodynamic model using Ecopath to perform network analysis. Based on fieldwork (October 2017 - May 2018) and literature review, we identified 57 functional groups comprising 51 consumers (including 15 top predators), five primary producers plus detritus, and cluster analysis of trait profiles. The connectance index (0.17) and the system omnivory index (0.22) are low, suggesting that consumers feed on a few discrete trophic levels. Biomass of primary producers (grazing food chain; 186.8 t km-2) provides 9,813 t km(-2) y(-1), whereas flow from detritus supply 344.9 t km(-2) y(-1). The transfer efficiency decreases as flows go up the food web, from 12% at TL II to 4% at TL X, and throughput cycled (including detritus) = 118.7 t km(-2) y(-1). In comparison with other coral reefs, we found that Cabo Pulmo complies with the attributes to resist disturbances, with an estimated total system throughput = 95,789 t km(-2) y(-1) (52%) flowbits and overhead = 116,164 (48%) flowbits. The high quality of the ecosystem services provided by Cabo Pulmo and the scenic beauty appeals to developers. Although the system is resilient, unregulated human activities may impact the reef condition and decrease the residents' quality of life and that of all the people who make a living from the low impact activities currently in effect. The trophic web model presented here may help to improve the response capacity of the coalition of residents, authorities, diving companies, and NGO's to preserve the reef and be a key element to conserve the system by contributing to its best management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,APR,2021,123,,,,,,,,107359,10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.107359,,,,,,,WOS:000615942100008,,,,,,

Understanding how ecosystems respond to El Nino is the key to the success of ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM). However, few studies have focussed on the ecosystems respond to this natural perturbation in China seas, and the selection of effective ecological network analyses (ENA) indicators to evaluate the ecosystem response under El Nino conditions needs to be assessed. In this study, we constructed Ecopath models for Haizhou Bay in ENSO-neutral (2013) and El Nino (2015) years. Comprehensive analyses were conducted to evaluate ENA indicators in terms of sensitivity to the ecosystem variations, robustness to the model parameters uncertainties, and statistical check. Results showed that there were obvious variations in the species composition and biomass in the Haizhou Bay ecosystem under the El Nino event. Four optimal ENA indicators were selected, including total system throughput, total primary production, total system non-cycled throughflow, and ascendency. The indicators further showed a shrunken ecosystem size, increased energetic efficiency, and less organised ecosystem under the El Nino event. These findings enhance our understanding of ecosystem dynamics and underscore the need for precautionary management under El Nino conditions. Moreover, this work can be helpful in guiding the further selection of ENA indicators for evaluating and managing marine ecosystems during El Nino events elsewhere and thusly contribute to the implementation of EBFM.

Using long-term monitoring data of butterfly assemblages, we tested the effects of the amount and distribution of semi-natural habitat (SNH), moderated by species traits, on climate-driven species turnover. We found that spatially dispersed SNH favoured the colonisation of warm-adapted and mobile species. In contrast, extinction risk of cold-adapted species increased in dispersed (as opposed to aggregated) habitats and when the amount of SNH was low.

The exchange of inorganic and organic materials between the sediment and water column through benthic-pelagic coupling plays a very important role especially in shallow water ecosystems. It is facilitated mainly by trophic interactions between the benthic and pelagic food webs, or specifically, between the coupling links i.e. the nodes that participate in coupling. Aquatic ecosystem models incorporating benthic food web in details have been few. In the present study, a food web model incorporating both benthic and pelagic food webs has been developed using EcoPath with EcoSim software, for Kakinada Bay ecosystem of Coastal Andhra Pradesh, India and has been analysed to get an idea about this system?s functioning and integrity. Hypothetical perturbation scenarios (perturbation of biomass of two important benthic components ? microphytobenthos and suspension feeding invertebrates) were applied to the model to study the effects of these two components on overall system robustness and integrity. The analysis of the base model revealed that while the bay system has not yet attained maturity, it also does not face much stress. While the system saw a decline in maturity with increase in microphytobenthos (MPB) biomass, increase in biomass of suspension feeding invertebrate (SFI) resulted in the exact opposite. Study of SFI biomass perturbation scenario also highlighted its role in coupling. Modelling studies incorporating benthic components as separate groups have been few. This work aims to provide a better insight into how benthic components may affect the whole system.

However, human-nature interactions within and between adjacent and distant systems (metacouplings) are rarely studied in fisheries despite their prevalence and policy relevance. We filled this knowledge gap by using network models to identify how the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has rewired couplings and reshaped resilience of Fishadelphia, a community-supported fishery program (CSF) in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, USA. As abstractions illustrating interactions among supply-chain actors, networks are helpful for characterizing flows and assessing resilience to disturbances such as those induced by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Since Fall 2018, 18 seafood (finfish and shellfish) species totaling 6273 lbs have flowed from harvesters (n = 4), to processors (n = 2), to a distributor, to retailers (n = 2), and finally to customers (n = 183). The pandemic reduced the number of seafood harvesters and processors (-50%), seafood flow quantity (-25%), species diversity in the marketplace (-67%), and species per supplier (-50%) before stopping flows in mid-March 2020, when Fishadelphia closed for 3 months. Models of network optimality indicated that the pandemic fragmented metacouplings that previously allowed multiple seafood suppliers to provide diverse products to customers. However, demand-side resilience increased through dispersed, socially distanced, efficient seafood delivery that expanded the customer base and generally increased customer satisfaction. This resilience dichotomy-wherein the post-closure network was less resilient than the pre-closure network in supply-side species diversity, but more resilient in demand-side social distancing, delivery efficiency, and customer satisfaction-has implications for rewiring networks to sustain CSFs and other local food systems amid ecological and social disturbances.",,,,"Levin, Simon/J-1218-2014","Levin, Simon/0000-0002-8216-5639; Rubenstein, Dan/0000-0001-9049-5219",,,,,,,,,,,,1748-9326,,,,,MAR,2021,16,3,,,,,,,34054,10.1088/1748-9326/abe4f6,,,,,,,WOS:000624518700001,,,,,,

Objectives We investigated the effect of composition and configuration for topographic, ecological and disturbance factors on mammal species richness. In addition, we examined whether the magnitude and predictive strength of the relationship with richness varied with spatial scale. Methods We sampled ground-dwelling mammals at 187 sites in the Otway Ranges of south-eastern Australia. A gradient modelling approach was used to characterise landscape composition and configuration for each predictor. Relationships with mammal richness were modelled using Bayesian Networks at ten different spatial scales (7-1165 ha). Results Composition and configuration were both important to species richness, although the strength and presence of relationships varied across the ten scales. Patterns in NDVI, time since fire, habitat complexity and elevation had the strongest effects on mammal species richness.

For nocturnal or cryptic species, quantifying habitat use across individually marked animals can allow unbiased assessment of intervention efficacy and identify other important habitats. Here, using a landscape-scale experiment, we examine whether interventions intended to create nesting habitat for the largely nocturnal Eurasian Stone-curlew Burhinus oedicnemus within semi-natural grassland also provide foraging habitat. GPS loggers were fitted to five adult Stone-curlews during the breeding season within an extensive area of semi-natural grassland (3850 ha, hereafter 'grassland'), surrounded by a mosaic of arable cropland (total study area 118 600 ha). The largely closed-sward grassland was diversified by experimental ground-disturbance plots (the intervention) prior to this study. We used the GPS fixes to identify 1881 foraging locations (510 during nesting and 1371 post-breeding) across the grassland and surrounding landscape. Most foraging locations were close to the nest-site during the nesting period (90% within 1 km) or day-roost during post-breeding (90% within 5 km), but birds travelled up to 4.1 km from these sites during nesting and 13 km post-breeding. Stone-curlews were two- (by night) or three-times (by day) more likely to select disturbed-grassland over unmodified grassland for foraging during nesting, and c. 15 times more likely to do so post-breeding. Spring-sown crops and pig fields or manure heaps were also selected over grassland for nocturnal foraging. Given that central place foraging occurs in this species, conservation efforts that promote breeding attempts through ground-disturbance should ensure suitable foraging habitat is near the nest (<1 km). Creating multiple areas of disturbed-ground close to the edge of large grassland blocks can provide a network of nesting and foraging habitats, while allowing access to foraging habitats on the surrounding arable farmland. Similar interventions may benefit other disturbance associated grassland waders.",,,,,"Dolman, Paul/0000-0002-9340-2791",,,,,,,,,,,,1367-9430,1469-1795,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/acv.12678,,FEB 2021,,,,,WOS:000621767900001,,,,,,

Previous global investigations of mammal functional diversity have relied on range maps instead of observational data to determine community composition. We test the effects of species pools, habitat heterogeneity, primary productivity and human disturbance on the functional diversity (dispersion and richness) of mammal communities using the largest standardized tropical forest camera trap monitoring system, the Tropical Ecology Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network. We use occupancy values derived from the camera trap data to calculate occupancy-weighted functional diversity and use Bayesian generalized linear regression to determine the effects of multiple predictors. Mammal community functional dispersion increased with primary productivity, while functional richness decreased with human-induced local extinctions and was significantly lower in Madagascar than other tropical regions. The significant positive relationship between functional dispersion and productivity was evident only when functional dispersion was weighted by species' occupancies. Thus, observational data from standardized monitoring can reveal the drivers of mammal communities in ways that are not readily apparent from range map-based studies. The positive association between occupancy-weighted functional dispersion of tropical forest mammal communities and primary productivity suggests that unique functional traits may be more beneficial in more productive ecosystems and may allow species to persist at higher abundances.",,,,,"Johnson, Steig/0000-0003-2257-8949; Espinosa, Santiago/0000-0002-7416-7167; Ahumada, Jorge/0000-0003-0953-9101; Santos, Fernanda/0000-0002-1886-446X; Tonos, Jadelys/0000-0001-8792-9717; Rovero, Francesco/0000-0001-6688-1494",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,FEB 24,2021,288,1945,,,,,,,20202098,10.1098/rspb.2020.2098,,,,,,,WOS:000625110700014,33593187,,,,,

In forested catchments, these fluxes are prone to alterations caused by anthropogenic and natural disturbances. In this study, we modelled the interannual spatiotemporal evolution of hydrosedimentary connectivity influenced by forest cover change over the last four decades in the Mont-Louis catchment, a medium snow-dominated mountainous catchment in eastern Canada, which had 62% of its total surface affected by forest disturbances (mainly logging, but also wildfires and diseases) between 1979 and 2017. Using a geomorphometric index of connectivity (IC) and a historical forest cover database, we produced one IC map per year that considered anthropogenic and natural disturbances affecting the forest cover of the studied catchment. To account for vegetation recovery, forest disturbances were weighted with local hydrological recovery rates. Over the four decades, the mean IC of the Mont-Louis catchment dramatically increased by 35% in response to different types of disturbances. The spatial evolution of IC over the whole catchment and at the sub-catchment scale revealed that disturbance location has a strong influence on hydrosedimentary connectivity to the main channel. Our results also highlight the sharp contrast between IC computed from topography-based impedance to those computed from vegetation-based impedance.

Mussels were exposed to BaP (5, 50 & 100 mu g/L) and C-60 (C-60-1mg/L) separately and in combination. Both BaP and C-60 were shown to co-localize in the secondary lysosomes of the hepatopancreatic digestive cells in the digestive gland where they reduced lysosomal membrane stability (LMS) or increased membrane permeability, while BaP also induced increased lysosomal lipid and lipofuscin, indicative of oxidative cell injury and autophagic dysfunction. Combinations of BaP and C-60 showed antagonistic effects for lysosomal stability, mTORC1 (mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1) inhibition and intralysosomal lipid (5 & 50 mu g/L BaP). The biomarker data (i.e., LMS, lysosomal lipidosis and lipofuscin accumulation; lysosomal/cell volume and dephosphorylation of mTORC1) were further analysed using multivariate statistics. Principal component and cluster analysis clearly indicated that BaP on its own was more injurious than in combination with C-60. Use of a network model that integrated the biomarker data for the cell pathophysiological processes, indicated that there were significant antagonistic interactions in network complexity (% connectance) at all BaP concentrations for the combined treatments. Loss of lysosomal membrane stability probably causes the release of intralysosomal iron and hydrolases into the cytosol, where iron can generate harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS). It was inferred that this adverse oxidative reaction induced by BaP was ameliorated in the combination treatments by the ROS scavenging property of intralysosomal C-60, thus limiting the injury to the lysosomalmembrane; and reducing the oxidative damage in the cytosol and to the nuclear DNA. The ROS scavenging by C-60, in combination with enhanced autophagic turnover of damaged cell constituents, appeared to have a cytoprotective effect against the toxic reaction to BaP in the combined treatments.

In turn, biodiversity shapes ecological networks and enhances ecosystem functioning. However, whether and how facilitation and increased biodiversity jointly influence community structure and ecosystem functioning remains unclear. We performed a field experiment disentangling the relative contribution of nurse plants and increasing understorey plant diversity in driving pollination interactions. Both the presence of nurse shrubs and increased understorey plant diversity increased pollinator diversity and visitation rates. While nurse and understorey diversity effects on pollinator visitation rates did not interact, the effects of increasing understorey plant diversity on pollinator diversity were stronger in the absence than in the presence of shrubs, meaning that nurse shrubs attenuated the effects of high understorey diversity and buffered the effects of low understorey diversity. We also found positive complementarity effects among understorey species as well as complementarity between nurse plants and understorey species at high diversity. Results also indicate negative selection effects, suggesting that species with generally few pollinators benefit the most in the polyculture while a species (possibly the nurse plant) with generally lots of pollinators does not. The corresponding changes in pollination networks with the experimental treatments were due to both changes in the frequency of visits and turnover in pollinator community composition. Synthesis. Plant-plant facilitative systems, where a nurse plant increases understorey plant diversity, are common in stressful environments.

In North America, one of the primary sources of habitat modification over the last 2 decades has been exploration for and production of oil and natural gas (hydrocarbon development), which has led to demographic and behavioral impacts to numerous wildlife species. Developing effective measures to mitigate these impacts has become a critical task for wildlife managers and conservation practitioners. However, this task has been hindered by the difficulties involved in identifying and isolating factors driving population responses. Current research on responses of wildlife to development predominantly quantifies behavior, but it is not always clear how these responses scale to demography and population dynamics. Concomitant assessments of behavior and population-level processes are needed to gain the mechanistic understanding required to develop effective mitigation approaches. We simultaneously assessed the demographic and behavioral responses of a mule deer population to natural gas development on winter range in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, USA, from 2008 to 2015. Notably, this was the period when development declined from high levels of active drilling to only production phase activity (i.e., no drilling). We focused our data collection on 2 contiguous mule deer winter range study areas that experienced starkly different levels of hydrocarbon development within the Piceance Basin. We assessed mule deer behavioral responses to a range of development features with varying levels of associated human activity by examining habitat selection patterns of nearly 400 individual adult female mule deer. Concurrently, we assessed the demographic and physiological effects of natural gas development by comparing annual adult female and overwinter fawn (6-month-old animals) survival, December fawn mass, adult female late and early winter body fat, age, pregnancy rates, fetal counts, and lactation rates in December between the 2 study areas. Strong differences in habitat selection between the 2 study areas were apparent. Deer in the less-developed study area avoided development during the day and night, and selected habitat presumed to be used for foraging. Deer in the heavily developed study area selected habitat presumed to be used for thermal and security cover to a greater degree. Deer faced with higher densities of development avoided areas with more well pads during the day and responded neutrally or selected for these areas at night. Deer in both study areas showed a strong reduction in use of areas around well pads that were being drilled, which is the phase of energy development associated with the greatest amount of human presence, vehicle traffic, noise, and artificial light. Despite divergent habitat selection patterns, we found no effects of development on individual condition or reproduction and found no differences in any of the physiological or vital rate parameters measured at the population level. However, deer density and annual increases in density were higher in the low-development area. Thus, the recorded behavioral alterations did not appear to be associated with demographic or physiological costs measured at the individual level, possibly because populations are below winter range carrying capacity. Differences in population density between the 2 areas may be a result of a population decline prior to our study (when development was initiated) or area-specific differences in habitat quality, juvenile dispersal, or neonatal or juvenile survival; however, we lack the required data to contrast evidence for these mechanisms. Given our results, it appears that deer can adjust to relatively high densities of well pads in the production phase (the period with markedly lower human activity on the landscape), provided there is sufficient vegetative and topographic cover afforded to them and populations are below carrying capacity. The strong reaction to wells in the drilling phase of development suggests mitigation efforts should focus on this activity and stage of development. Many of the wells in this area were directionally drilled from multiple-well pads, leading to a reduced footprint of disturbance, but were still related to strong behavioral responses. Our results also indicate the likely value of mitigation efforts focusing on reducing human activity (i.e., vehicle traffic, light, and noise). In combination, these findings indicate that attention should be paid to the spatial configuration of the final development footprint to ensure adequate cover. In our study system, minimizing the road network through landscape-level development planning would be valuable (i.e., exploring a maximum road density criteria). Lastly, our study highlights the importance of concomitant assessments of behavior and demography to provide a comprehensive understanding of how wildlife respond to habitat modification.

Herbivorous insects were sampled from three population patches of M. fistulifera in Brazilian Atlantic forest areas: two areas were subjected to distinct intensities of anthropogenic disturbances (firebreak and park access road, considered edges of low- and high-impact, respectively), and one in the forest interior (control). We expected a lower species richness and abundance of herbivorous interacting with plants in forest edges than in the forest interior apart from to differences in the species composition. Therefore, based on these predictions, we expected that the various disturbances related to edge effects may change the topology of individual-based plant-herbivorous networks. We observed that species richness and abundance of herbivorous in high-impact environments decreased in relation to forest interior, as well the species composition differed between these areas. Disturbance jeopardised network specialisation but did not change the topology of individual-based networks, which presented a modular pattern. Edges affected herbivorous diversity and decreased the interaction overlap as individual-based networks became highly specialised with increasing disturbance. These results enhance the understanding of edge effects and resilience of plant-herbivorous interactions in regularly disturbed tropical environments.",,,,,"Luna, Pedro/0000-0002-0047-6469",,,,,,,,,,,,1442-9985,1442-9993,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/aec.13001,,JAN 2021,,,,,WOS:000612539900001,,,,,,

In the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, a region where key biodiversity faces unprecedented risks from climate change and where there is a growing demand to extract resources, a number of marine areas have been afforded enhanced conservation or management measures through two adopted marine protected areas (MPAs). However, evidence suggests that additional high quality areas could benefit from a proposed network of MPAs. Penguins offer a particular opportunity to identify high quality areas because these birds, as highly visible central-place foragers, are considered indicator species whose populations reflect the state of the surrounding marine environment. We compiled a comprehensive dataset of the location of penguin colonies and their associated abundance estimates in Antarctica. We then estimated the at-sea distribution of birds based on information derived from tracking data and through the application of a modified foraging radius approach with a density decay function to identify some of the most important marine areas for chick-rearing adult penguins throughout waters surrounding Antarctica following the Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA) framework. Additionally, we assessed how marine IBAs overlapped with the currently adopted and proposed network of key management areas (primarily MPAs), and how the krill fishery likely overlapped with marine IBAs over the past five decades. We identified 63 marine IBAs throughout Antarctic waters and found that were the proposed MPAs to be adopted, the permanent conservation of high quality areas for penguin species would increase by between 49 and 100% depending on the species. Furthermore, our data show that, despite a generally contracting range of operation by the krill fishery in Antarctica over the past five decades, a consistently disproportionate amount of krill is being harvested within marine IBAs compared to the total area in which the fishery operates. Our results support the designation of the proposed MPA network and offer additional guidance as to where decision-makers should act before further perturbation occurs in the Antarctic marine ecosystem.",,,,"Cardenas, Cesar/ABF-1664-2020; Dias, Maria/AAK-1171-2021; Franco, Aldina/G-2144-2010","Dias, Maria/0000-0002-7281-4391; Franco, Aldina/0000-0001-6055-7378; Cardenas, Cesar/0000-0001-6662-6899",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,JAN 20,2021,7,,,,,,,,602972,10.3389/fmars.2020.602972,,,,,,,WOS:000612354800001,,,,,,

Contact heterogeneity among hosts determines invasion and spreading dynamics of infectious disease, thus its characterization is essential for identifying effective disease control strategies. Yet, little is known about the factors shaping contact networks in many wildlife species and how wildlife management actions might affect contact networks. 2. Wild pigs in North America are an invasive, socially structured species that pose a health concern for domestic swine given their ability to transmit numerous devastating diseases such as African swine fever (ASF). Using proximity loggers and GPS data from 48 wild pigs in Florida and South Carolina, USA, we employed a probabilistic framework to estimate weighted contact networks. We determined the effects of sex, social group and spatial distribution (monthly home-range overlap and distance) on wild pig contact. We also estimated the impacts of management-induced perturbations on contact and inferred their effects on ASF establishment in wild pigs with simulation. 3. Social group membership was the primary factor influencing contacts. Between-group contacts depended primarily on space use characteristics, with fewer contacts among groups separated by >2 km and no contacts among groups >4 km apart within a month. 4. Modelling ASF dynamics on the contact network demonstrated that indirect contacts resulting from baiting (a typical method of attracting wild pigs or game species to a site to enhance recreational hunting) increased the risk of disease establishment by similar to 33% relative to direct contact. Low-intensity population reduction (<5.9% of the population) had no detectable impact on contact structure but reduced predicted ASF establishment risk relative to no population reduction. 5.

Unraveling the dynamics of microbial flora is therefore essential to better apprehend the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on the health of host populations and the ecological integrity of hydrosystems. In this context, the present study simultaneously examined changes in the microbial communities associated with mucosal skin and gut tissues of eight fish species along an urbanization gradient in the Orge River (France). 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding revealed that the structure and composition of the skin microbiota varied substantially along the disturbance gradient and to a lesser extent according to fish taxonomy. Sequences affiliated with the Gammaproteobacteria, in particular the genus Aeromonas, prevailed on fish caught in the most urbanized areas, whereas they were nearly absent upstream. This rise of opportunistic taxa was concomitant with a decline in phylogenetic diversity, suggesting more constraining environmental pressures. In comparison, fish gut microbiota varied much more moderately with the degree of urbanization, possibly because this niche might be less directly exposed to environmental stressors. Co-occurrence networks further identified pairs of associated bacterial taxa, co-existing more or less often than expected at random. Few correlations could be identified between skin and gut bacterial taxa, supporting the assumption that these two microbial niches are disconnected and do not suffer from the same vulnerability to anthropic pressures.",,,,"COLIN, Yannick/L-4121-2017","COLIN, Yannick/0000-0002-7074-9311",,,,,,,,,,,,0095-3628,1432-184X,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s00248-020-01650-2,,JAN 2021,,,,,WOS:000605852200004,33415385,,,,,

To date, few studies have looked at its long-term effect on biodiversity and even fewer on common species. Here, using citizen science data, we investigated this effect on the temporal trends of widespread and common bird species in France, over the period 2002-2016. We found results consistent with previous findings demonstrating a significant decline of common bird populations in France. However, we show that this decline is less steep within N2000 areas than outside, especially for farmland specialists. While SPAs and SACs contribute to the overall effect on bird populations, SACs contribute most to the less steep decline of farmland species within N2000 network. Despite generally more diverse bird communities within N2000 areas, their designation has not prevented their ongoing functional biotic homogenization. We conclude that, common bird species - not directly targeted by the Directives - may have benefited from the N2000 protection or management measures. However, the positive but limited effect of the N2000 network suggests that it is not able to reverse negative population trends either because the land management or spatially extent are insufficient. As such, we suggest that improving management plans, expanding existing PA, establishing new ones, are the priority actions that may help improve N2000 effectiveness.",,,,"Prince, Karine/T-4491-2017","Prince, Karine/0000-0001-7739-7438",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,JAN,2021,253,,,,,,,,108871,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108871,,,,,,,WOS:000611989800002,,,,,,

An inadequate number of recaptures can make it difficult to account for heterogeneity in detection parameters. We used data from large-scale camera-trapping surveys in three forest reserves in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, to (1) examine whether a high-density camera-trap network increases the number of recaptures for females, which tend to be more difficult to detect, thus improving the accuracy of density estimates; (2) compare density estimates from models incorporating individual heterogeneity in detection parameters with estimates from the null model to evaluate its potential bias; and (3) investigate how the size of the camera-trap grid affects density and movement estimates. We found that individual heterogeneity could not be incorporated in the single-site data analysis and only conservative null model estimates could be generated. However, aggregating data across study sites enabled us to account for individual heterogeneity and we estimated densities of 1.27-2.82 individuals/100 km(2), 2-3 times higher than estimates from null models. In light of these findings, it is possible that earlier studies underestimated population density. Similar densities found in well-managed forest and recently selectively logged forest suggest that Sunda clouded leopards are relatively resilient to forest disturbances.

Within lake ecosystems, species distributions and concordance patterns are driven by both local and regional heterogeneity, though their relative importance across trophic levels has rarely been explored. We developed a statistical framework to compare responses of taxa from different trophic levels to abiotic factors and determine how this affected multi-trophic network structures. In particular, we used multi-species concordance modelling (concordance analysis and RV coefficient) to determine species associations and correlations within and among three trophic levels (phytoplankton, zooplankton and fish communities sampled across 49 southern Quebec lakes, covering eight hydrological regions). We then used multiple factor analysis, latent variable modelling and local contributions of sites to beta diversity to assess the relative importance of major environmental gradients in structuring species co-responses and species interaction turnover across the landscape. Our analyses confirmed that concordant species within each trophic level varied jointly or segregated into different pelagic food webs in Quebec lakes where important acidification and eutrophication took place. Some keynote species were indicators of different food web compartments and distinguished groups of lakes along multiple environmental niche dimensions. Among the three trophic levels examined, zooplankton depicted the highest proportion of species concordance and appeared to act as a trophic linkage between phytoplankton and fish. Ultimately, the losses or gains in species richness and species interactions were strongly driven by environmental gradients. This study provides for the first time a combined analysis of the effects of environmental heterogeneity on ecological communities belonging to three trophic levels sampled near simultaneously across an 800 km broad lacustrine landscape.

Isotopic abundance analysis reveals no differences between mucus and white muscle, thus confirming mucus samples as reliable non-invasive biomarkers. Mucus production was evaluated using a single labelled meal packaged in a gelatine capsule, with both C-13 and N-15, via a time-course trial. C-13 was gradually allocated to skin mucus fractions over the first 12 h and was significantly (4-fold) higher in the soluble fraction, indicating a higher turnover of soluble mucus components that are continuously produced and supplied. N-15 was also gradually allocated to mucus, indicating incorporation of new proteins containing the labelled dietary amino acids, but with no differences between fractions. When existent mucuswas removed, dietary stable isotopes revealed stimulated mucus neoformation dependent on the components.

In doing so, they are dependent on networks of coastal and interior wetland ecosystems. To aid in the effective conservation and management of their populations, and to assess the impact of threats facing shorebirds, standardized data on shorebird abundance are needed from multiple sites representing a gradient of conditions across the hemisphere. Such data would provide insight on whether fluctuations at one location represent real changes in abundance because of some localized threat, or whether other factors acting across broader scales such as the redistribution of predators, are responsible. We designed the Migratory Shorebird Project (MSP), now implemented in 11 countries along the Pacific Coast of the Americas, to characterize spatial and temporal variation in shorebird abundance, to understand which factors (habitat, threats) most influence their populations across the flyway, and to increase capacity for integrated research, monitoring, and conservation. We used bird inventory data from historical surveys and spatial data on habitat distribution along with a set of hypotheses about important threats to guide the design of the project and to identify data requirements to test hypotheses. We counted birds one time per year at 84 nonbreeding sites (similar to 1400 sampling units) between 15 November and 15 February, when shorebirds were relatively stationary. In each of the first three annual counts from 2013/14 to 2015/16, the Migratory Shorebird Project counted similar to 1M shorebirds representing 44 species, including five species for which > 20% of the estimated biogeographic population was recorded annually, and nine additional species with > 5% recorded annually. The magnitude of variability in estimates of shorebird abundance was inversely correlated with survey effort with the most uncertainty, and lowest survey effort, in the South Temperate region followed by the Neotropical region (southern Mexico to northern Peru) and then the North Temperate region. Evaluation of variance highlighted both among-site and among-unit (units are nested within sites) variation in bird abundance and cover types as well as threats such as potential disturbance and predator abundance. Overall, shorebird density was significantly, and positively, associated with the area (ha) of intertidal mudflats, beaches, and aquaculture. Survey units with intermediate levels of bare ground and flooding had the highest shorebird density. As for threats, we found, contrary to our hypothesis, that shorebird abundance was significantly, and positively, associated, with the density of Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus); however we found no relationship between shorebird abundance and the amount of urban development, our index to potential human disturbance, in the surrounding landscape.

Here, we develop a simple theoretical framework that allows measuring the relative strength of intraspecific versus interspecific competition in dominance hierarchies. We use it to evaluate mechanisms promoting coexistence between two congeneric charr that compete for foraging positions, which strongly influence density-dependent growth and survival. Agonistic interactions (n = 761) among 71 Dolly Varden Salvelinus malma and whitespotted charr Salvelinus leucomaenis were measured by snorkelling in two pools in the sympatric zone of a Hokkaido stream during two summers. Interspecific dominance hierarchies, analysed using three methods, were closely correlated with fish length but the species treated each other equally. Ranks for the most dominant fish in each pool, determined directly by knockout experiments, were also virtually identical to ranks by length. Similarly, exponential random graph modelling of the social networks provided no evidence that either species was dominant over the other. Instead, larger fish were more likely to win contests, especially over fish of the next lower ranks. These results demonstrated that the two species were nearly ecological equivalents in accessing key resources in this sympatric zone. Nearly identical growth and stable densities over 4 years further supported this inference, although Dolly Varden were a minority (29% of the assemblage), a sign of some fitness difference. Detailed foraging observations coupled with two concurrent studies revealed an effective stabilizing mechanism. Dolly Varden shifted to feeding directly from the benthos when drifting invertebrates declined, a behaviour enhanced by morphological character displacement, thereby partitioning food resources and enhancing intraspecific competition while avoiding agonistic encounters with whitespotted charr. The plurality of evidence indicates that fitness differences between these ecologically equivalent species are small in this local assemblage, and balanced by resource partitioning, a modest stabilizing mechanism that promotes coexistence. The theoretical framework presented here is a useful tool to evaluate the strength of interspecific versus intraspecific competition, which combined with information on trade-offs in ecological performance can contribute to a mechanistic understanding of species coexistence.",,,,,"Kitano, Satoshi/0000-0001-5441-4442",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,FEB,2021,90,2,,,,,515,527,,10.1111/1365-2656.13384,,NOV 2020,,,,,WOS:000592396200001,33159688,,,,,

In particular, it is important to understand the patterns and drivers of spatial variation in local community dynamics, generalizing temporal trends from discrete locations to entire landscapes that are the main focus of management. Here, we present a framework for producing spatially continuous views of community dynamics, focusing on stream fish affected by hydropower development. Location River Sabor, NE Portugal. Methods We sampled stream fish at thirty sites between 2012 and 2019. Community trajectory analysis was used to quantify the directionality and velocity of community change, and the geometric resemblance of community trajectories between sites. Geostatistical models for stream networks were used to relate metrics describing community dynamics to environmental variables, while controlling for Euclidean and hydrologic spatial dependencies, and to map spatial variation in community dynamics across the watershed. Results Trajectories in multivariate space underlined strong temporal dynamics, with local communities deviating and returning to previous states, but without evidence for directional changes. Accordingly, directionality values were low and not consistently affected by environmental variables. The velocity of community change varied markedly across the watershed and it was strongly affected by stream order and elevation, with faster changes observed in lowland streams draining into hydroelectric reservoirs and with a high proportion of exotic species. Pairwise distances between community trajectories were strongly related to hydrologic and environmental distances between sites. Main conclusions Local stream fish communities were in a loose equilibrium across the watershed, but they fluctuated at a faster rate closer to a hydroelectric reservoir.

In this study we investigated relationships between ecosystem N cycling and tree defoliation during a recent 2015-18 irruption of invasive gypsy moth caterpillars (Lymantria dispar), which can cause tree stress and sometimes mortality following multiple years of defoliation. Nitrogen is a critical nutrient that limits the growth of caterpillars and plants in temperate forests. In this study, we assessed the associations among N concentrations, soil solution N availability and defoliation intensity by L. dispar at the scale of individual trees and forest plots. We measured leaf and soil N concentrations and soil solution inorganic N availability among individual red oak trees (Quercus rubra) in Amherst, MA and across a network of forest plots in Central Massachusetts. We combined these field data with estimated defoliation severity derived from Landsat imagery to assess relationships between plot-scale defoliation and ecosystem N cycling. We found that trees in soil with lower N concentrations experienced more herbivory than trees in soil with higher N concentrations. Additionally, forest plots with lower N soil were correlated with more severe L. dispar defoliation, which matched the tree-level relationship. The amount of inorganic N in soil solution was strongly positively correlated with defoliation intensity and the number of sequential years of defoliation. These results suggested that higher ecosystem N pools might promote the resistance of oak trees to L. dispar defoliation and that defoliation severity across multiple years is associated with a linear increase in soil solution inorganic N.",,,,,"Matthes, Jaclyn/0000-0001-8999-8062",,,,,,,,,,,,2041-2851,,,,,NOV 13,2020,12,6,,,,,,,,10.1093/aobpla/plaa059,,,,,,,WOS:000597238100001,33324482,,,,,

Identifying whether seasonal network changes are the result of turnover or rewiring (i.e. rearrangement of interactions among species), also remains understudied in multi-trophic communities. Using species abundance data for 38 species over three years (from nine sites across central/eastern United States) and a novel tree-based inference method, we constructed seasonal networks for a multi-trophic freshwater stream fish community. We found that seasonality influences species interactions, particularly through rewiring (81%) as compared to species turnover (19%). Moreover, the number of rewiring interactions was best explained by fish status as a piscivore/non-piscivore and species maximum length (R-2 = 0.41). Our findings suggest that rewiring may be a dominant process in stream fish communities experiencing seasonal environments and that traits linked to trophic-level could be a good indicator of a species contribution to rewiring. As networks dominated by rewiring may be more robust, this network approach could be a valuable conservation tool for identifying which biological relationships must be retained for communities to avoid extinction.",,,,,"Brimacombe, Chris/0000-0002-9368-6106; Bodner, Korryn/0000-0002-1752-3954",,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,FEB,2021,44,2,,,,,219,230,,10.1111/ecog.05452,,NOV 2020,,,,,WOS:000587471900001,,,,,,

Many of these traits are phylogenetically conserved, implying a decrease in trait similarity with increasing phylogenetic distance of the host plant taxa. Thus, a metric of phylogenetic distances and relationships can be considered a proxy for phylogenetically conserved plant traits and used to predict variation in herbivorous insect assemblages among co-occurring plant species. Using a Holarctic dataset of exposed-feeding and shelter-building caterpillars, we aimed at showing how phylogenetic relationships among host plants explain compositional changes and characteristics of herbivore assemblages. Our plant-caterpillar network data derived from plot-based samplings at three different continents included >28,000 individual caterpillar-plant interactions. We tested whether increasing phylogenetic distance of the host plants leads to a decrease in caterpillar assemblage overlap. We further investigated to what degree phylogenetic isolation of a host tree species within the local community explains abundance, density, richness, and mean specialization of its associated caterpillar assemblage. The overlap of caterpillar assemblages decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance among the host tree species. Phylogenetic isolation of a host plant within the local plant community was correlated with lower richness and mean specialization of the associated caterpillar assemblages. Phylogenetic isolation had no effect on caterpillar abundance or density. The effects of plant phylogeny were consistent across exposed-feeding and shelter-building caterpillars. Our study reveals that distance metrics obtained from host plant phylogeny are useful predictors to explain compositional turnover among hosts and host-specific variations in richness and mean specialization of associated insect herbivore assemblages in temperate broadleaf forests. As phylogenetic information of plant communities is becoming increasingly available, further large-scale studies are needed to investigate to what degree plant phylogeny structures herbivore assemblages in other biomes and ecosystems.",,,,"Sigut, Martin/T-2926-2019; Volf, Martin/O-4321-2017; Jorge, Leonardo Re/A-1528-2009; Pyszko, Petr/AAJ-4324-2021; Lamarre, Greg/O-8665-2017; Novotny, Vojtech/G-9434-2014; Drozd, Pavel/J-3943-2013; Libra, Martin/U-6437-2019; Seifert, Carlo L./ABI-6483-2020","Sigut, Martin/0000-0003-4876-9794; Volf, Martin/0000-0003-4126-3897; Jorge, Leonardo Re/0000-0003-4518-4328; Pyszko, Petr/0000-0002-3743-7201; Lamarre, Greg/0000-0002-7645-985X; Novotny, Vojtech/0000-0001-7918-8023; Drozd, Pavel/0000-0002-4602-8856; Libra, Martin/0000-0003-3608-8780; Seifert, Carlo Lutz/0000-0002-2295-2833",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,DEC,2020,10,24,,,,,14137,14151,,10.1002/ece3.7005,,NOV 2020,,,,,WOS:000586782100001,33732431,,,,,

However, there has been limited research examining metacommunity structure of communities in high mountain streams. These ecosystems are often physically constrained and can display large environmental gradients within a relatively small spatial extent. Here, we examined metacommunity structures of stream organisms in a high mountain region, which is part of the Hengduan Mountains region in Southwest China. Macroinvertebrates and diatoms were collected from six streams in two opposite aspects of the same mountain with different connectivity between streams. On the west aspect, streams are tributaries of a river (i.e., river-connected) while streams flow into a lake (i.e., lake-connected) on the east aspect. We used Elements of Metacommunity Structure analysis to explore the metacommunity structuring of these two biological models. We also compared the contribution of dispersal and environmental filtering in structuring metacommunities by looking at Euclidean, network, topographic, and environmental distances. Communities of diatoms and macroinvertebrates were structured with clear turnover on both aspects. Further, diatom communities exhibited Clementsian structure on both aspects. Macroinvertebrates exhibited different metacommunity structures on the river-connected aspect (Quasi-Clementsian) and lake-connected aspect (Clementsian). Our results indicated that on the lake-connected aspect, environmental filtering had a stronger association with community dissimilarity than on the river-connected aspect for both macroinvertebrate and diatom communities. Diatom communities were more influenced by environmental filtering on the east aspect with weakened network connectivity compared with those on the west aspect. Our results also emphasized the potential effects of biotic interactions between macroinvertebrates and diatoms on shaping community structures of one other. Our study provides substantial elements to further understand metacommunity structure and highlights the necessity of future research to reveal the underlying mechanisms of community structuring in these remote ecosystems.",,,,"He, Fengzhi/AAE-9085-2019; Maasri, Alain/F-7995-2010","He, Fengzhi/0000-0002-7594-8205; Maasri, Alain/0000-0003-1236-8374",,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,OCT 21,2020,8,,,,,,,,571887,10.3389/fevo.2020.571887,,,,,,,WOS:000584550900001,,,,,,

We review the growing literature on temporal dynamics of plant-animal mutualistic networks including pollination, seed dispersal and ant defence mutualisms. We then discuss potential mechanisms underlying such variation in interactions, ranging from behavioural and physiological processes at the finest temporal scales to ecological and evolutionary processes at the broadest. We find that at the finest temporal scales (days, weeks, months) mutualistic interactions are highly dynamic, with considerable variation in network structure. At intermediate scales (years, decades), networks still exhibit high levels of temporal variation, but such variation appears to influence network properties only weakly. At the broadest temporal scales (many decades, centuries and beyond), continued shifts in interactions appear to reshape network structure, leading to dramatic community changes, including loss of species and function.

These declines are believed to be broadly related to climate and landscape change. At the western reaches of moose continental range, in the interior of British Columbia, Canada, wildlife managers have reported widespread declines of moose populations. Disturbances to forests from a mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonum ponderosae) outbreak and associated salvage logging infrastructure in British Columbia are suspected as a mechanism manifested in moose behavior and habitat selection. We examined seasonal differences in moose habitat selection in response to landscape change from mountain pine beetle salvage logging infrastructure: dense road networks and large intensive forest harvest cutblocks. We used 157,447 global positioning system locations from 83 adult female moose from 2012 to 2016 on the Bonaparte Plateau at the southern edge of the Interior Plateau of central British Columbia to test whether increased forage availability, landscape features associated with increased mortality risk, or the cumulative effects of salvage logging best explain female moose distribution using resource selection functions in an information-theoretic framework. We tested these hypotheses across biological seasons, defined using a cluster analysis framework. The cumulative effects of forage availability and risk best predicted resource selection of female moose in all seasons; however, the covariates included in the cumulative models varied between seasons. The top forage availability model better explained moose habitat use than the top risk model in all seasons, except for the calving and fall seasons where the top risk model (distance to road) better predicted moose space use. Selection of habitat that provides forage in winter, spring, and summer suggests that moose seasonally trade predation risk for the benefits of foraging in early seral vegetation communities in highly disturbed landscapes. Our results identified the need for intensive landscape-scale management to stem moose population declines. Additional research is needed on predator densities, space use, and calf survival in relation to salvage logging infrastructure.

Many investigations into sociality and disease may nevertheless be subject to cryptic spatial variation, so ignoring spatial processes can limit inference regarding disease dynamics. Disease analyses can gain breadth, power and reliability from incorporating both spatial and social behavioural data. However, the tools for collecting and analysing these data simultaneously can be complex and unintuitive, and it is often unclear when spatial variation must be accounted for. These difficulties contribute to the scarcity of simultaneous spatial-social network analyses in disease ecology thus far. Here, we detail scenarios in disease ecology that benefit from spatial-social analysis. We describe procedures for simultaneous collection of both spatial and social data, and we outline statistical approaches that can control for and estimate spatial-social covariance in disease ecology analyses. We hope disease researchers will expand social network analyses to more often include spatial components and questions.

By regulating physical processes and creating local disturbances, ecosystem engineers can serve as important elements of passive habitat restoration, as they continuously alter and shape their environments. Native to North American temperate wetlands, the common muskrat (Ondatra zibethicus) is an ecosystem engineer that alters its environment through herbivory, house and structure building, and creation of activity networks. While the physical consequences of muskrat disturbances are well-known, few studies have quantified their impact on the wetland biotic community. We conducted a field study to investigate the effects of muskrat herbivory and structure building on plant biodiversity in wetlands along the upper St. Lawrence River (New York, USA) that have been extensively modified by long-term water regulation and non-native cattail invasion. Plant species richness and diversity were greater in muskrat-disturbed areas compared to at-large reference plots within the same wetlands. Soil saturation mediated the biodiversity impacts of muskrats, with intermediate moisture levels resulting in the highest species richness. These interacting drivers, muskrat activity and hydrology, had a compensatory effect on plant biodiversity loss associated with non-native cattail invasion. Multivariate analysis indicated a distinct plant community associated with muskrat disturbances. Analysis of spatiotemporal patterns of house locations suggests that some muskrats reuse house locations in sequential years, likely amplifying the intensity and duration of their impacts. This study demonstrates that muskrat disturbance influences wetland plant diversity at scales relevant to regional drivers of plant diversity.",,,,,"Stella, John/0000-0001-6095-7726; Kua, Zi Xun/0000-0003-1534-3914",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,OCT,2020,11,10,,,,,,,e03256,10.1002/ecs2.3256,,,,,,,WOS:000588068600020,,,,,,

In vertebrate-dependent seed dispersal, mutualisms between frugivores and fruiting plants depend, in part, on matching of functional traits. High species turnover of frugivores has occurred on the Hawaiian Islands, owing to both the loss of native frugivores and the introduction of a new suite of frugivores. How this turnover has altered the functional traits of frugivores and the potential impacts on seed dispersal remain unclear. We investigated how avian frugivore traits differed between historic and modern assemblages of the Hawaiian Islands. We also tested how traits shifted within foraging guilds (ground vs. arboreal) to distinguish potential impacts on plants within low versus high forest strata. Compared to historic frugivores, the modern assemblage is smaller in gape width and body mass in both ground and arboreal guilds. Wing shape did not significantly change between assemblages. From the results, we postulate that changes in the frugivore community have likely altered seed dispersal processes by reducing (a) the size of seeds consumed, (b) frugivory rates per animal and (c) seed dispersal distances. Owing to seed size placing strong constraints on consumption, we reviewed recent studies on frugivory by modern birds in the Hawaiian Islands and compared the size of seeds consumed versus seeds available. We found that larger-seeded plants (>8.1 mm seed width) were not consumed by modern birds and were more likely to be of conservation risk compared to smaller-seeded plants. Consequently, dispersal limitation may threaten Hawaiian plant communities, with larger-seeded plants at greatest risk of extinction. Broadly, we show that extensive turnover within assemblages may lead to significant changes in functional traits, with potential knock-on effects for mutualistic interactions and communities.

We tested whether the social structure of cooperative groups of sociable weavers Philetairus socius varied with environmental temperature. We recorded the nature and frequency of interactions at feeders positioned beneath three sociable weaver colonies (n =49 identified birds) in the Kalahari Desert with respect to environmental temperatures over a 30-day period. Using random forest models, we examined whether thermal conditions predicted variation in social network structure. We also conducted focal observations of individual weavers to assess functional links between temperature, intensity of heat dissipation behaviour (panting) and immediate effects on social behaviour. Our results suggest that the social structure of weaver colonies becomes less cohesive and more fragmented at extreme and variable environmental temperatures. These changes in network structure appear to be linked with individuals' heat dissipation behaviour: extreme and variable temperatures were associated with increased panting, which was significantly correlated with an immediate reduction in the frequency of association.

Group territory size and territory overlap and components of spatial organization, provide key information as these metrics may be indicators of habitat quality, resource dispersion, contact rates and environmental risk (e.g. indirectly transmitted pathogens). Furthermore, sociality and behaviour can also shape space use, and subsequently, how space use and habitat quality together impact demography. Our study aims to identify factors shaping the spatial organization of wildlife populations and assess the impact of epizootics on space use. We further aim to explore the mechanisms by which disease perturbations could cause changes in spatial organization. Here we assessed the seasonal spatial organization of Serengeti lions and Yellowstone wolves at the group level. We use network analysis to describe spatial organization and connectivity of social groups. We then examine the factors predicting mean territory size and mean territory overlap for each population using generalized additive models. We demonstrate that lions and wolves were similar in that group-level factors, such as number of groups and shaped spatial organization more than population-level factors, such as population density. Factors shaping territory size were slightly different than factors shaping territory overlap; for example, wolf pack size was an important predictor of territory overlap, but not territory size. Lion spatial networks were more highly connected, while wolf spatial networks varied seasonally. We found that resource dispersion may be more important for driving territory size and overlap for wolves than for lions. Additionally, canine distemper epizootics may have altered lion spatial organization, highlighting the importance of including infectious disease epizootics in studies of behavioural and movement ecology. We provide insight about when we might expect to observe the impacts of resource dispersion, disease perturbations, and other ecological factors on spatial organization.

As fishes grow in body size, they can consume larger-bodied prey items at potentially-higher trophic levels. Therefore, body size should predict trophic position. Trophic position (TP) is useful for describing energy flow between biota, giving a more comprehensive picture of aquatic food webs, but the factors that influence the body-size-TP relationship are unclear. Additionally, stable isotope-derived TP and body-size relationships are untested for temperate freshwater fishes. Using linear mixed-effects models, we tested fish body mass as a predictor of TP across 6 species of temperate freshwater fish (n= 921 total individuals) sampled from 110 stream reaches in New Zealand, and we evaluated habitat factors (flood disturbance and stream size) likely to affect trophic structure of stream fish assemblages. Supporting ecological theory, but contrasting with some previous findings in marine and tropical environments, we found that TP was positively associated with body size across all species.

Succession following disturbance offers a good opportunity to address this question. Studies of single-trophic guilds suggest that, shortly after a disturbance, such as a fire, neutral assembly processes (e.g. colonisation events) dominate; whereas, niche processes (selection) become more and more important as succession proceeds. Building on these observations, we predict similar changes in interaction networks during succession, with a shift from stochastic toward selective interactions. To test this, we studied succession of plant-herbivorous insect networks in South Africa after a fire. We sampled a total of 385 herbivorous arthropod species and 92 plant species. For different successional stages and spatial grain sizes, we used network descriptors to estimate plant-herbivore specificity and partner fidelity of plant and herbivore species across networks (i.e. localities). We compared the observed network descriptors to neutral models, and then differentiated selective species (associated with similar partner species in different networks) from neutral species (associated at random with their partners). Our results suggest that specialisation, partner fidelity and the proportion of selective species of plants and herbivores increased with succession, which is consistent with the hypothesis that niche-based processes prevail over neutral processes as succession proceeds. However, in all the successional stages, the majority of species were neutral species, which pinpoints the importance of opportunistic interactions in the assembly of trophic networks.",,,,"Pauw, Anton/A-6126-2008","Pauw, Anton/0000-0002-4012-648X",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,OCT,2020,194,1-2,,,,,123,134,,10.1007/s00442-020-04740-7,,AUG 2020,,,,,WOS:000564503900001,32865688,,,,,

Using a large-scale remote time-lapse camera network and a modeling framework adapted from capture-recapture studies, we assess drivers of intra- and inter-annual dynamics in gentoo penguin breeding success across nearly the entire species' range in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. We quantify the precise timing of egg/chick mortality within each season and examine the role of precipitation events, tourism visitation, and fishing activity for Antarctic krillEuphausia superba(a principal prey resource in the Antarctic) in these processes. We find that nest failure rates are higher in the egg than the chick stage and that neither krill fishing nor tourism visitation had a strong effect on gentoo penguin breeding success. While precipitation events had, on average, little effect on nest mortality, results suggest that extreme weather events can precipitate sharp increases in nest failure.

Freshwater biodiversity is at particular risk, but previous studies have focused on popular cold-water fishes (e.g., salmon, trout, and char) with relatively large body sizes and mobility. Those fishes may be able to track habitat change more adeptly than less mobile species. Smaller, less mobile fishes are rarely represented in studies demonstrating effects of climate change, but depending on their thermal tolerance, they may be particularly vulnerable to environmental change. By revisiting 280 sites over a 20 year interval throughout a warming riverscape, we described changes in occupancy (i.e., site extirpation and colonization probabilities) and assessed the environmental conditions associated with those changes for four fishes spanning a range of body sizes, thermal and habitat preferences. Two larger-bodied trout species exhibited small changes in site occupancy, with bull trout experiencing a 9.2% (95% CI = 8.3%-10.1%) reduction, mostly in warmer stream reaches, and westslope cutthroat trout experiencing a nonsignificant 1% increase. The small-bodied cool water slimy sculpin was originally distributed broadly throughout the network and experienced a 48.0% (95% CI = 42.0%-54.0%) reduction in site occupancy with declines common in warmer stream reaches and areas subject to wildfire disturbances. The small-bodied comparatively warmer water longnose dace primarily occupied larger streams and increased its occurrence in the lower portions of connected tributaries during the study period. Distribution shifts for sculpin and dace were significantly constrained by barriers, which included anthropogenic water diversions, natural step-pools and cascades in steeper upstream reaches.

Bivalve culture, particularly mussel farming, relies on naturally occurring plankton and numerous studies have demonstrated top-down control on phytoplankton, increased nutrients through excretion of metabolic wastes and remineralization of faeces and pseudofaeces, and bottom-up effects on predators and scavengers through mussel fall-off. However, results are inconsistent between studies, and hydrodynamic conditions and nutrient availability are thought to play an important role in the magnitude and the direction of the ecological effects of mussel culture on the surrounding ecosystem. We used qualitative network models (QNMs), to outline a general model that integrates these environmental conditions and (1) evaluated the ability of different model configurations to reproduce known responses to perturbations, (2) analyzed the behaviour of key components to contrasting hydrodynamic and nutrient condition scenarios, and (3) identified the most influential features of the derived scenarios. The model that included uncertain linkages to characterize unknown relationships performed best based on predetermined validation criteria; the addition of semi-quantitative information on the relative strength of certain linkages improved accuracy and sign determinacy of outcomes. The presence of suspended mussel culture negatively affected primary producers, zooplankton and deposit-feeders, and had a positive effect on predators and scavengers, especially in low-energy environments.

Results revealed that coastal areas would undergo the highest species loss among the Bay of Biscay species, depending on their vertical habitat (benthic, demersal, benthopelagic or pelagic). Benthic and demersal species were projected to experience a westward shift, which would induce a deepening of those species. In contrast, pelagic species were projected to shift northward. The potential ecological niche for half of the studied species, mostly benthic and demersal, was projected to decrease under climate change. In addition, a high rate of southern species arrivals is expected (+ 28%).

In this study, we analyzed the temporal dynamics of the structure of plant-hummingbird interaction networks by evaluating changes in species richness, diversity of interactions, modularity, network specialization, nestedness, and beta-diversity of interactions throughout four years in a Mexican xeric shrubland landscape. We also evaluated if the relative importance of abundance, phenology, morphology, and nectar sugar content consistently explains the frequency of pairwise interactions between plants and hummingbirds across different years. We found that species richness, diversity of interactions, nestedness, and network specialization did vary within and among years. We also observed that the beta-diversity of interactions was high among years and was mostly associated with species turnover (i.e., changes in species composition), with a minor contribution of interaction rewiring (i.e., shifting partner species at different times). Finally, the temporal co-occurrence of hummingbird and plant species among months was the best predictor of the frequency of pairwise interactions, and this pattern was consistent within and among years.

Studies on the response of species interaction networks to anthropogenic disturbance have almost exclusively focused on one interaction type at a time, such as mutualistic or antagonistic interactions, making it challenging to decipher how networks of different interaction types respond to the same anthropogenic disturbance. Moreover, few studies have simultaneously focused on the two main components of network structure: network topology (i.e., architecture) and network ecology (i.e., species identities and interaction turnover), thereby limiting our understanding of the ecological drivers underlying changes in network topology in response to anthropogenic disturbance. Here, we used 16,400 plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interaction observations from 16 sites along an agricultural intensification gradient to compare changes in network topology and ecology between mutualistic and antagonistic networks. We measured two aspects of network topology-nestedness and modularity-and found that although the mutualistic networks were consistently more nested than antagonistic networks and antagonistic networks were consistently more modular, the rate of change in nestedness and modularity along the gradient was comparable between the two network types. Change in network ecology, however, was distinct between mutualistic and antagonistic networks, with partner switching making a significantly larger contribution to interaction turnover in the mutualistic networks than in the antagonistic networks, and species turnover being a strong contributor to interaction turnover in the antagonistic networks. The ecological and topological changes we observed in the antagonistic and mutualistic networks have different implications for pollinator and herbivore communities in agricultural landscapes, and support the idea that pollinators are more labile in their interaction partner choice, whereas herbivores form more reciprocally specialized, and therefore more vulnerable, interactions. Our results also demonstrate that studying both topological and ecological network structure can help to elucidate the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on ecological communities, with applications for conservation and restoration of species interactions and the ecosystem processes they maintain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,OCT,2020,101,10,,,,,,,,10.1002/ecy.3116,,AUG 2020,,,,,WOS:000556384500001,32530504,,,,,

Wildland fire regimes in western U.S. coniferous forests are now characterized by longer fire seasons and greater frequency, with further changes expected. Identifying the impacts of altered fire regimes on forest resources may enable land managers to plan mitigation strategies or prepare for novel or altered communities. We created a stochastic, density-dependent, matrix projection model for a whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) metapopulation to estimate the impacts of increasing fire frequency on metapopulation persistence. Whitebark pine is a widely distributed foundation species of management concern found in upper subalpine and tree line forests of the Northern Rocky Mountains. We parameterized the model using empirically based demographic data from the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE) and validated the model by comparing observed whitebark pine densities to those projected by the model when parameterized with historical demographic rates and fire frequencies. We reparameterized the model with current demographic rates including mortality from insect outbreaks and exotic disease. We compared odds of functional extirpation among six scenarios comprising three altered fire frequencies (fires suppressed, historical fire return interval of 268 yr, and decreasing fire return intervals from current to 97 yr) and two seed dispersal probabilities. Historical parameterization with high dispersal probability projected median whitebark pine densities (40.95 trees/ha, first and third quartiles: 21.89, 67.25), which were similar to empirically estimated densities (40.62 trees/ha, first and third quartiles: 12.04, 114.15). Odds of functional extirpation with increasing fire frequency were 8.26 and 139.91 times higher than historical fire frequency and fire suppression, respectively. In decreasing fire return interval scenarios, odds of functional extirpation were 1.76 times higher in low than high dispersal probability scenarios.

However, there are concerns that the presence and construction of trails affect the quality of wildlife habitats, extending human disturbance into secluded areas. In this study, we developed a before-after control-impact experimental design to investigate the impacts of new trail construction on six terrestrial vertebrate species in an Appalachian protected area in the U.S. Using camera traps, we monitored animal use of the study area before, during, and after construction, on the trail, near the trail, and at a control site. Our results indicate statistically significant impacts of trail building and presence on four common species. During trail construction, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and coyotes (Canis latrans) decreased their activity on and/or near the trail, while raccoons (Procyon lotor) increased activity on the trail. These three species returned to the area at pre-building levels once trail construction was complete. After trail building, eastern gray squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) showed decreased use of the trail area. We also observed altered timing of daily activity patterns for squirrels and deer, both diurnal species. Deer activity became more spread throughout the day within the near-trail zone during construction. After the trail was complete, squirrels shifted activity to earlier in the day, after sunrise and prior to the peak of recreational activity. We conclude that while trail building may alter habitat quality for some species, this mostly occurred during the construction phase, and was fairly minor for our study species. To minimize impacts, we suggest that trail building be restricted to a short time period during a season when species of concern are least sensitive.

However, ecosystem models have been limited in their ability to engage in the management of living marine resources due in part to high levels of uncertainty in model parameters and model outputs. Additionally, for multispecies or food web models, there is uncertainty about the predator-prey functional response, which can have implications for population dynamics. In this study, we evaluate the sensitivity of large marine food webs in Alaska to parameter uncertainty, including parameters that govern the predator-prey functional response. We use Rpath, an R implementation of the food web modeling program Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE), to conduct a series of mortality-based perturbations to examine the sensitivity and recovery time of higher trophic level groups in the eastern Chukchi Sea, eastern Bering Sea, and Gulf of Alaska. We use a Monte Carlo approach to generate thousands of plausible ecosystems by drawing parameter sets from the range of uncertainty around the base model parameters. We subjected the ecosystem ensembles to a series of mortality-based perturbations to identify which functional groups the higher trophic level groups are most sensitive to when their mortality was increased, whether the food webs returned to their unperturbed configurations following a perturbation, and how long it took to return to that state. In all three ecosystems, we found that the number of disrupted ensemble food webs was positively related to the biomass and the number of trophic links of the perturbed functional group, and negatively related to trophic level. The eastern Chukchi Sea was most sensitive to perturbations to benthic invertebrate groups, the eastern Bering Sea was most sensitive to shrimp and walleye pollock, and the Gulf of Alaska was most sensitive to shrimps, pelagic forage fish, and zooplankton. Recovery time to perturbations were generally less than 5 years in all three ecosystems. The recovery times when fish groups were perturbed were generally longer than when benthic invertebrates were perturbed, and recovery times were shortest when it was pelagic invertebrates.

In February-March 2017, this event caused extraordinary heavy rains and a rise in water temperatures along the coast of northern Peru, inducing negative consequences for the small-scale fisheries and scallop (Argopecten mupurams) aquaculture sectors, both representing important socio-economic activities in the region. Responses of local resource users to these changes were highly diverse, with a great number of people leaving the region in search for work in fishing and non-fishing activities. With a particular emphasis on the province of Sechura, this work attempts to shed light on how and why migration flows differ for fishers and scallop farmers and to explore future pathways in the context of post-disturbance recovery.

However, the reduction in anthropogenic pressure due to such management measures is rarely estimated. Although MPA networks may cover a large proportion of the seabed, designated areas that prohibit damaging fishing activity are often much smaller. This case study compares fishing pressure inside and outside areas covered by Scottish MPAs and MPA management measures, further relating its distribution to bottom ruggedness, which influences benthic communities and their exposure to mobile bottom fishing. While 7% of the study region was found to be within MPA boundaries, only 2.5% of the region was subject to management measures that restrict mobile bottom fishing. Taking historical levels of fishing as a benchmark, management measures have been applied to < 0.6% of the swept area of existing mobile bottom fishing activity. This may be explained by the higher average seabed ruggedness within MPA management measures, which was also where some key species of conservation interest were found. These findings suggest that protection has been focussed in areas that already act as natural refugia for sensitive benthic species and lie away from the majority of fishing activity. While the measures do not reduce fishing pressure markedly, they do protect relatively pristine habitats from future fishing impacts. MPA management measures had higher average seabed ruggedness, suggesting a bias in protection for species and habitats within such areas.",,,,"WRIGHT, PETER J/C-8536-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,JUL,2020,247,,,,,,,,108511,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108511,,,,,,,WOS:000540247600002,,,,,,

Cavity-nesters exist within networks known as nest webs that link trees, excavators, e.g. woodpeckers, and nonexcavators (many songbirds, ducks, raptors, and other organisms) at the community level. We use the idea of panarchy (interacting adaptive cycles at multiple spatio-temporal scales) to expand the nest web concept to levels from single tree to biome. We then assess properties of nest web systems (redundancy, heterogeneity, memory, uncertainty, and nonlinearity) using examples from our studies in temperate, subtropical, and tropical forests of the Americas. Although nest webs from Chile, Canada, Argentina, and Ecuador have independent evolutionary histories, structures, and disturbance regimes, they share the main properties of complex adaptive systems. Heterogeneity, redundancy, and memory allow nest web systems to absorb some degree of disturbance without undergoing a regime shift; that is, without changing their basic structures and functions, i.e., the system's identity. Understanding nest webs as complex adaptive systems will inform management practices to nurture the resilience of forest biodiversity in the face of local, regional, and global social-ecological changes.",,,,,"Ibarra, Jose Tomas/0000-0002-7705-3974",,,,,,,,,,,,1708-3087,,,,,JUN,2020,25,2,,,,,,,27,10.5751/ES-11590-250227,,,,,,,WOS:000545036900025,,,,,,

Yet diagnosing specialization is complicated both by the difficulty of precisely quantifying diet composition and by definitional ambiguity: what makes a diet 'diverse'? We sought to characterize the relationship between taxonomic dietary diversity (TDD) and phylogenetic dietary diversity (PDD) in a species-rich community of large mammalian herbivores in a semi-arid East African savanna. We hypothesized that TDD and PDD would be positively correlated within and among species, because taxonomically diverse diets are likely to include plants from many lineages. By using DNA metabarcoding to analyse 1,281 faecal samples collected across multiple seasons, we compiled high-resolution diet profiles for 25 sympatric large-herbivore species. For each of these populations, we calculated TDD and PDD with reference to a DNA reference library for local plants. Contrary to our hypothesis, measures of TDD and PDD were either uncorrelated or negatively correlated with each other. Thus, these metrics reflect distinct dimensions of dietary specialization both within and among species. In general, grazers and ruminants exhibited greater TDD, but lower PDD, than did browsers and non-ruminants. We found significant seasonal variation in TDD and/or PDD for all but four species (Grevy's zebra, buffalo, elephant, Grant's gazelle); however, the relationship between TDD and PDD was consistent across seasons for all but one of the 12 best-sampled species (plains zebra). Our results show that taxonomic generalists can be phylogenetic specialists, and vice versa. These two dimensions of dietary diversity suggest contrasting implications for efforts to predict how consumers will respond to climate change and other environmental perturbations. For example, populations with low TDD may be sensitive to phylogenetically 'random' losses of food species, whereas populations with low PDD may be comparatively more sensitive to environmental changes that disadvantage entire plant lineages-and populations with low dietary diversity in both taxonomic and phylogenetic dimensions may be most vulnerable of all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JUN,2020,89,6,,,,,1482,1496,,10.1111/1365-2656.13206,,,,,,,WOS:000538799700017,32163591,,,,,

In a multi-site field experiment, we tested the effects of spatial variation in benthic communities and environmental characteristics along natural gradients in sediment grain size. We experimentally simulated the depletion of large benthic macrofauna to assess the impact of these functionally important taxa on key ecosystem functions through ammonium and oxygen solute fluxes across the sediment-water interface. The magnitude of change in solute fluxes varied across sites and depletion treatments and was explained by changes in both sediment physico-chemical characteristics and the functional attributes of the benthic community.

This stable population of marine mammals resides relatively close to shore near a large human population and offers a novel opportunity to evaluate whether disease acts in a density-dependent manner to limit population growth. We conducted a retrospective analysis of harbor seal stranding and necropsy findings in the San Juan Islands sub-population to assess age-related stranding trends and causes of mortality. Between January 01, 2002 and December 31, 2018, we detected 882 harbor seals that stranded and died in San Juan County and conducted necropsies on 244 of these animals to determine primary and contributing causes of death. Age-related seasonal patterns of stranded animals were evident, with pups found in the summer, weaned pups primarily recovered during fall, and adults and sub-adults recovered in summer and fall. Pups were the most vulnerable to mortality (64% of strandings). Pups predominantly died of nutritional causes (emaciation) (70%), whereas sub-adults and adults presented primarily with clinical signs and gross lesions of infectious disease (42%) and with non-anthropogenic trauma (27%). Primary causes of weaned pup mortality were distributed equally among nutritional, infectious, non-anthropogenic trauma, and anthropogenic trauma categories. Nutritional causes of mortality in pups were likely related to limitations in mid- and late-gestational maternal nutrition, post-partum mismothering, or maternal separation possibly related to human disturbance. Infectious causes were contributing factors in 33% of pups dying of nutritional causes (primarily emaciation-malnutrition syndrome), suggesting an interaction between poor nutritional condition and enhanced susceptibility to infectious diseases. Additional primary causes of harbor seal mortality were related to congenital disorders, predation, human interaction, and infections, including zoonotic and multidrug-resistant pathogens. Bottom-up nutritional limitations for pups, in part possibly related to human disturbance, as well as top-down predatory influences (likely under-represented through strandings) and infectious disease, are important regulators of population growth in this stable, recovered marine mammal population.",,,,,"Ashley, Elizabeth/0000-0003-3251-9221; Adler, Tessa/0000-0001-8357-3127",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,MAY 13,2020,7,,,,,,,,319,10.3389/fmars.2020.00319,,,,,,,WOS:000532206400001,,,,,,

Mutualistic networks, such as those of plants and pollinators tend to have a core set of properties that often relate to the resilience of the community, or the ability of the community to retain function and structure after a disturbance. Furthermore, network structure is highly dependent on the number of specialists and generalists; however, it is unclear how different groups of species with various life-history strategies influence network structure. In this study, we evaluated how the composition of plants and pollinators within 16 oak-savanna sites changed across a latitudinal gradient. In addition, we evaluated how the abundance of different groups of plants and pollinators affected network metrics related to resilience. We found that the composition of plants and pollinators varied between ecoregions, while pollinator composition further varied with habitat characteristics. Network metrics displayed no spatial pattern but were related to the abundance of several pollinator groups. Above-ground nesting insects had a positive relationship with nestedness and a negative relationship with modularity, while predatory larvae had a negative relationship with modularity. Thus, above-ground nesting insects and predatory larvae could be expected to increase network resilience.

Here, we test four hypotheses on the factors affecting the network structure of terrestrial vertebrate scavenger assemblages and its implications on ecosystem functioning. We expect scavenger assemblages to be more nested (i.e. structured): 1) in species-rich and productive regions, as nestedness has been linked to high competition for carrion resources, and 2) regions with low human impact, because the most efficient carrion consumers that promote nestedness are large vertebrate scavengers, which are especially sensitive to human persecution. 3) We also expect climatic conditions to affect assemblage structure, because some scavenger assemblages have been shown to be more nested in colder months. Finally, 4) we expect more organized assemblages to be more efficient in the consumption of the resource. We first analyzed the relationship between the nestedness of the scavenger assemblages and climatic variables (i.e. temperature, precipitation, temperature variability and precipitation variability), ecosystem productivity and biomass (i.e. NDVI) and degree of human impact (i.e. human footprint) using 53 study sites in 22 countries across five continents. Then, we related structure (i.e. nestedness) with its function (i.e. carrion consumption rate). We found a more nested structure for scavenger assemblages in regions with higher NDVI values and lower human footprint. Moreover, more organized assemblages were more efficient in the consumption of carrion. However, our results did not support the prediction that the structure of the scavenger assemblages is directly related to climate. Our findings suggest that the nested structure of vertebrate scavenger assemblages affects its functionality and is driven by anthropogenic disturbance and ecosystem productivity worldwide. Disarray of scavenger assemblage structure by anthropogenic disturbance may lead to decreases in functionality of the terrestrial ecosystems via loss of key species and trophic facilitation processes.",,,,"Arrondo, Eneko/ABG-1859-2020; Per, Esra/AAD-2108-2021; Cortes-Avizanda, Ainara/C-6634-2013; Morales-Reyes, Zebensui/A-4134-2018; Koike, Shinsuke/C-4619-2013; Koike, Shinsuke/AAN-2806-2020; Selva, Nuria/J-6970-2013; Butler, James RA/D-7446-2011; Margalida, Antoni/AAG-5337-2020; Allen, Maximilian/ABG-9307-2020; Botella, Francisco/F-7626-2011; Olea, Pedro P/AAH-2597-2021; Naves-Alegre, Lara/ABE-6857-2020; Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther/J-7883-2012; Perez-Garcia, Juan Manuel/A-7037-2012; Mateo-Tomas, Patricia/L-8471-2014; du Toit, Johan T/D-3390-2009; Margalida, Antoni/A-2723-2011","Arrondo, Eneko/0000-0003-1728-9800; Cortes-Avizanda, Ainara/0000-0002-9674-6434; Morales-Reyes, Zebensui/0000-0002-4529-8651; Koike, Shinsuke/0000-0002-2926-8196; Koike, Shinsuke/0000-0002-2926-8196; Selva, Nuria/0000-0003-3389-201X; Allen, Maximilian/0000-0001-8976-889X; Botella, Francisco/0000-0002-1877-5360; Olea, Pedro P/0000-0001-5387-9598; Naves-Alegre, Lara/0000-0002-4712-4129; Sebastian-Gonzalez, Esther/0000-0001-7229-1845; Perez-Garcia, Juan Manuel/0000-0002-1191-0187; Mateo-Tomas, Patricia/0000-0001-6762-9514; du Toit, Johan T/0000-0003-0705-7117; Ordiz, Andres/0000-0002-6141-8457; Newsome, Thomas/0000-0003-3457-3256; Zimmermann, Barbara/0000-0001-5133-9379; Margalida, Antoni/0000-0002-0576-3993",,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,AUG,2020,43,8,,,,,1143,1155,,10.1111/ecog.05083,,MAY 2020,,,,,WOS:000530883000001,,,,,,

In South Africa, regional climatic variation is subject to effects of oceanic current systems, which in turn, determine species diversity patterns. We hypothesize that regional climates and topography are important drivers of aquatic insect species richness, endemism, and assemblage composition, and expect strong assemblage-turnover boundaries to be concurrent with topographical features. We also expected that current conservation networks do not represent aquatic insect species richness and endemism. We used generalized linear mixed models and generalized dissimilarity models to determine drivers of South African dragonfly (Odonata) species richness and assemblage-turnover, as well as to investigate the extent of assemblage-turnover boundaries. We found that climate gradients were significant drivers, and found significant variation in assemblages between sub-regions. Turnover boundaries were gradual but concurrent with topographical features and/or areas with spatial changes in sub-regional climate. Modern-day climate and topography partially explained dragonfly diversity patterns, but other local factors and past geological events likely both contribute to current dragonfly diversity patterns. The existing conservation network in South Africa represents areas of high dragonfly species richness and endemism. We recommend additional conservation efforts in areas outside of protected areas with high species richness and endemism levels, but importantly also in areas with high assemblage-turnover rates to ensure protection of as many species as possible.

Yet, we know very little about the effect of human impacts on ecological processes derived from trophic interactions. By focusing on biodiversity components of consumer and resource organisms, such as the diversity of phylogenetic lineages and the diversity of traits that influence species interactions, it is possible to simultaneously address the responses to disturbances and their effects on processes. Here, we evaluate the consequences of forest loss on the ecological process of frugivory between fleshy-fruited plants and frugivorous birds. For 2 years, and at 14 sites representing a gradient of forest cover in the Cantabrian Range (N Iberian Peninsula), we monitored fruit and bird abundance, and fruit consumption. We compared the response to forest loss of both plants and birds by assessing the changes in phylogenetic and trait-based functional diversity in relation to forest cover. We further evaluated how changes in these biodiversity components translate into functional changes by estimating the degree of functional complementarity of plant and bird species. We found different responses of plants and birds to forest loss. The diversity of plant assemblages did not respond to changes in forest cover, whereas bird assemblages markedly lost phylogenetic and trait-based functional diversity at high levels of forest loss. Functional complementarity of birds was well predicted by phylogenetic and trait-based functional diversity, but functional complementarity of plants depended exclusively on the diversity of traits. Forest loss filtered avian phylogenetic lineages and traits, and influenced how birds contributed to the frugivory process. These results show how the diversity decay of one trophic level may compromise ecological processes derived from trophic interactions. Therefore, we suggest that a multitrophic response-effect framework, which includes measures of functional traits, lineages and species functional contributions across trophic levels, may be required to fully understand the ecological consequences of biodiversity decays.

Previous studies have focused on arsenic poisoning in drinking water and the effects on gut microbes. The research on arseniasis through food, which involves the bio-transformation of arsenic, and the related changes in gut microbiome is insufficient. Method: Mice were exposed from animal feed prepared with four arsenic species (iAs(III), iAs(V), MMA, and DMA) at a dose of 30 mg/kg according to the arsenic species proportion in rice for 30 days and 60 days. The levels of total arsenic (tAs) and arsenic species in mice feces and urine samples were determined using ICP-MS and HPLC-ICP-MS, respectively. 16S rRNA and ITS gene sequencing were conducted on microbial DNA extracted from the feces samples. Results: At 30 days and 60 days exposure, the tAs levels excreted from urine were 0.0092 and 0.0093 mg/day, and tAs levels in feces were 0.0441 and 0.0409 mg/day, respectively. We found significant differences in arsenic species distribution in urine and feces (p < 0.05). In urine, the predominant arsenic species were iAs(III) (23% and 14%, respectively), DMA (55% and 70%, respectively), and uAs (unknown arsenic, 14% and 10%, respectively). In feces, the proportion of major arsenic species (iAsV, 26% and 21%; iAs(III), 16% and 15%; MMA, 14% and 14%; DMA, 19% and 19%; and uAs, 22% and 29%, respectively) were evenly distributed. Microbiological analysis (MRPP test, alpha- and beta-diversities) showed that diversity of gut bacteria was significantly related to arsenic exposure through food, but diversity of gut fungi is less affected. Manhattan plot and LEfSe analysis showed that arsenic exposure significantly changes microbial taxa, which might be directly associated with arsenic metabolism and diseases mediated by arsenic exposure, such as Deltaproteobacteria, Polynucleobacter, Saccharomyces, Candida, Amanitaceae, and Fusarium. Network analysis was used to identify the changing hub taxa in feces along with arsenic exposure. Function predicting analysis indicated that arsenic exposure might also significantly increase differential metabolic pathways and would disturb carbohydrates, lipid, and amino acids metabolism of gut bacteria. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that subchronic arsenic exposure via food significantly changes the gut microbiome, and the toxicity of arsenic in food, especially in staples, should be comprehensively evaluated in terms of the disturbance of microbiome, and feces might be the main pathway through which arsenic from food exposure is excreted and bio-transformed, providing a new insight into the investigation of bio-detoxification for arseniasis.",,,,"Hu, Wei/L-1154-2016","Hu, Wei/0000-0001-9332-9670",,,,,,,,,,,,0160-4120,1873-6750,,,,MAY,2020,138,,,,,,,,105600,10.1016/j.envint.2020.105600,,,,,,,WOS:000522749900009,32120061,,,,,

Maintaining disturbance regimes in these ecosystems are of great conservation concern, and require studies with the use of ecological indicators. Biotic interactions are a major component of biodiversity that are particularly sensitive to environmental changes, and therefore should be considered in ecosystem assessment and monitoring. One of the most common interactions between insects and plants is mediated by extrafloral nectaries (EFNs), where ants use food resources from plants in exchange for protection against herbivores. Here, we explored variations on this ant-plant interaction across a post-fire successional gradient (i.e., few months to more than two years since the last fire) in eleven grassland patches in South Brazil. We evaluated time-since-fire effects on (i) the grassland habitat structure, (ii) an EFN-bearing plant population: Chamaecrista repens, (iii) the EFN-visiting ant communities, and (iv) the ant-plant ecological networks. We expected fire-induced habitat changes to benefit this plant population, and to produce positive cascading effects on interacting ants, thus influencing the structure of ant-plant networks. Freshly-burnt sites presented increased C. repens abundance, and larger individuals with more reproductive structures and EFNs in comparison with sites longer without disturbances. Plant abundance and size were inversely related to the cover of dominant grasses along the habitat gradient. The density of EFN-visiting ants, but not their species richness, increased in freshly-burnt sites, stimulated by the greater resource offer and the habitat openness, which probably facilitated ant activity. Moreover, with increasing time-since-fire, ants interacted with fewer plants, and few species formed the network generalist core. These results could further suggest that the defense service against herbivory provided by ants is also diminished in grasslands longer without disturbances. Overall, by using a series of indicators of habitat change from multiple ecological levels, this study highlights the importance of disturbance for grassland biodiversity and their ecological interactions, helping to improve management decisions.",,,,"Drose, William/N-2803-2018; Podgaiski, Luciana Regina/D-4241-2013; de Souza Mendonca, Milton/J-6479-2012; Dattilo, Wesley/A-6371-2012","Drose, William/0000-0002-4509-777X; Podgaiski, Luciana Regina/0000-0001-8020-2312; de Souza Mendonca, Milton/0000-0001-5272-5124; Dattilo, Wesley/0000-0002-4758-4379; Veronese Correa da Silva, Carolina/0000-0003-3440-0507",,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,MAY,2020,112,,,,,,,,106094,10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106094,,,,,,,WOS:000518385800034,,,,,,

Yet, detailed knowledge of the spatial footprints of these threats is lacking, including where they overlap and how they change over time. These knowledge gaps are real barriers for effective conservation planning. Here, we develop a novel approach to reconstruct the individual and combined footprints of both threats over time. We combine satellite-based land-cover change maps, habitat suitability models and hunting pressure models to demonstrate our approach for the community of larger mammals (48 species > 1 kg) across the 1.1 million km(2) Gran Chaco region, a global deforestation hotspot covering parts of Argentina, Bolivia and Paraguay. This provides three key insights. First, we find that the footprints of habitat destruction and hunting pressure expanded considerably between 1985 and 2015, across 40% of the entire Chaco - twice the area affected by deforestation. Second, both threats increasingly acted together within the ranges of larger mammals in the Chaco (17% increase on average, +/- 20% SD, cumulative increase of co-occurring threats across 465 000 km(2)), suggesting large synergistic effects. Conversely, core areas of high-quality habitats declined on average by 38%. Third, we identified remaining priority areas for conservation in the northern and central Chaco, many of which are outside the protected area network. We also identify hotspots of high threat impacts in central Paraguay and northern Argentina, providing a spatial template for threat-specific conservation action. Overall, our findings suggest increasing synergistic effects between habitat destruction and hunting pressure in the Chaco, a situation likely common in many tropical deforestation frontiers.

We controlled for these factors and examined social aggregation patterns in juvenile Eastern garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis sirtalis). We assayed snakes individually for consistent individual differences in boldness and sociability. We then placed snakes in groups of 10 in an enclosure with four shelters and observed their social interactions over a period of 8 days. We demonstrate that the snakes actively seek social interaction, prefer to remain with larger aggregates, and associate nonrandomly with specific individuals or groups. We show that their social interaction patterns are influenced by individual boldness, sociability, and age. The snakes' social networks were perturbed twice a day by shuffling their locations. Despite these disturbances, the snakes eventually re-formed their preferred social environment. Aggregation and exploration patterns also varied across time, with most activity occurring later in the day. These results highlight the complexity of snake sociality and may have important implications for conservation efforts. Significance statement Snakes are often considered nonsocial animals, but this is inaccurate. We used social network analyses to compare juvenile Eastern garter snakes' group behaviors to their individual personalities. Our research demonstrates that these snakes actively seek out social interaction and prefer to join and remain with larger groups and that their social interaction patterns are influenced by consistent individual differences in boldness and sociability. Our work contributes to a sparse but growing body of literature on sociability in reptiles. This work is important for changing perceptions among the scientific community and the public as a whole.

For instance, chemical cues released when experiencing a disturbing event (i.e. 'disturbance cues'), such as a predator chase, can lead to antipredator avoidance and increased survival for nearby individuals. These chemicals also have potential to be produced as a voluntary signal for communicating threat to others. We found evidence for this hypothesis by manipulating the shoal familiarity of guppies from populations differing in background predation risk and then presenting their disturbance cues to unfamiliar conspecifics from the same populations. Receivers from low-risk sites increased shoal cohesion and decreased area use regardless of whether the disturbance cues were produced in donor groups where members were familiar or unfamiliar with each other. However, receivers from high-risk sites showed strong antipredator reactions towards disturbance chemicals produced in familiar groups and no response towards those produced in unfamiliar groups, suggesting that donors from high-risk sites may alter the quality or quantity of their disturbance cues to influence familiar individuals to enact predator defences. Because high-risk environments strengthen guppy social networks, these environments may facilitate reliance on chemical disturbance signalling to coordinate group defences with familiar individuals.",,,,"Feyten, Laurence/Z-2545-2019","Feyten, Laurence/0000-0002-3504-1975",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,MAY,2020,193,1,,,,,89,95,,10.1007/s00442-020-04652-6,,APR 2020,,,,,WOS:000526237800001,32296954,,,,,

This might occur either because species are replaced by others that fulfill similar network roles or because interaction probabilities are given by species relative abundances rather than by their functional traits. Alternatively, if species-specific traits are important drivers of realized interactions, any change in species composition should promote a certain degree of network structural dissimilarity. Here, we used a spatial-temporal system comprising asteraceous plants and flower head herbivores from remnants of Brazilian Cerrado to investigate whether the relationship between spatial beta-diversity of species and network structural dissimilarity changes over time. We measured species beta-diversity using Sorensen's dissimilarity index (beta(sor)) and its components of species replacement (beta(-3)) and richness differences (beta(rich)). Network structural dissimilarity was estimated using three different metrics: connectance, modularity, and web asymmetry. We show that, in general, the effect of species beta-diversity on network structure was time-dependent: While some periods presented a positive relationship between spatial beta-diversity and network structural dissimilarity, others presented no significant relationship.

However, the temporal dynamics of species interaction networks is usually assessed using independent 'snapshot' networks, which may provide an incomplete representation of ecological processes. The use of temporal multilayer networks, where networks (i.e. layers) are formally interconnected via interlayer links, can circumvent such limitation, allowing for a more realistic characterization of community structure and better predictions regarding long-term processes that rely on species interactions, such as seed dispersal. We used a 5-year bird-seed dispersal dataset to explore species and interaction turnover across years, network structure variability and the relationship between species topological roles on each year and their temporal persistence (i.e. species activity). We then implemented a temporal multilayer network approach to compute overall species versatility (centrality) and to reveal the modular structure of the 5-year multilayer network using changes in species relative abundances as proxies for the interlayer links between time-sequential networks. Network topology remained relatively constant across years and interaction turnover was mostly due to true rewiring (new links) between species. Overall, birds, some of which migratory, were temporally more reliable than fleshy-fruited plants. Interestingly, species present across more years tended to be more important to the structure of each years' seed dispersal network, independently of their relative abundance. The multilayer analysis identified four modules of tightly interacting species, all of which spanning across the 5 years, and with a greater stability in the composition of bird species when compared to plants.

Local factors acting on community assembly are typically related to environmental conditions while regional factors are typically related to dispersal. Previous research has not consistently demonstrated the importance of local or regional factors, but this is likely because these factors act in concert and not in isolation. Studies that simultaneously integrate local and regional factors into analyses of community assembly can be a useful avenue to further our understanding of this core concept in community ecology. Here, we aimed to identify metacommunity structure and diversity and the local and regional drivers of community assembly at the continental scale. We evaluated metacommunity structure and drivers of assembly of macroinvertebrate communities in 941 rivers and streams nested within nine ecoregions distributed across the conterminous United States. Pattern-based metacommunity analyses and boosted regression tree techniques were used to (a) assign metacommunity structures and (b) identify the environmental, landscape and network drivers of assembly. We also evaluated how biodiversity scaled across hierarchical levels and varied among ecoregions. Metacommunity structures were consistent for the conterminous United States and each of the nine ecoregion subsets, with each ecoregional metacommunity displaying a Clementsian structure. Environmental variables were the predominant drivers of assembly, suggesting the importance of species sorting and environmental filtering on community structure; however, the identity of the most influential environmental variables differed among ecoregions and suggested hierarchical filtering on assembly. Partitioned diversity was found to be lower at the local and ecoregional levels, but turnover in diversity among ecoregions was higher than expected. Our results demonstrate contingencies in community assembly, notwithstanding consistency in metacommunity structure and support the importance of environmental control over community assembly and biodiversity. Moreover, biodiversity at the continental scale is likely maintained through this inherent variation in the drivers of assembly and concomitant changes in community composition among ecoregions. We suggest that further work should evaluate the assembly of other facets of community structure and the underlying mechanisms of the contingency in assembly drivers.",,,,,"Murray-Stoker, David/0000-0002-4774-6948",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JUL,2020,89,7,,,,,1678,1689,,10.1111/1365-2656.13220,,APR 2020,,,,,WOS:000525205800001,32221972,,,,,

We studied eight seed-dispersal networks along the South American Andes and compared them with regard to their species composition and their composition of functional roles. We tested (1) if changes in bird species composition lead to changes in the composition of bird functional roles, and (2) if the similarity in species composition and functional-role composition decreased with increasing geographic distance between the networks. We also used cluster analysis to (3) identify bird species with similar roles across all networks based on the similarity in the plants they consume, (i) considering only the species identity of the plants and (ii) considering the functional traits of the plants.

However, the role of interactions with diaspore predators and secondary dispersers, which compose the dispersal filter and modulate plant community recovery, has been overlooked. We performed field experiments to investigate how soil disturbances affect diaspore interactions with the ground-foraging fauna to better understand how disturbance influences regeneration potential. Location Campo rupestre vegetation, megadiverse edaphic grasslands, southeastern Brazil. Methods We used diaspores from five native species to compare removal rates between disturbed (top soil removal) and preserved sites; we also controlled invertebrate and vertebrate access to determine their role. In addition, we assessed differences in the diaspore removal effectiveness (DRE) and the structure of animal-diaspore interactions through network based-approach. Results For three species, the average diaspore removal rates was relatively high (between 30% and 70%). Invertebrates were the most common removal agents in both disturbed and preserved sites. Interactions with foraging fauna and removal rates were 20% smaller in disturbed sites. Considering all diaspore removal events in disturbed sites, 24% resulted in the displacement from disturbed to preserved sites, but no diaspore was transported from preserved to disturbed ones. The animal-diaspore network was exclusively composed by ant-diaspore interactions and was more diverse and robust in preserved sites compared with disturbed ones. Seed predator ants (Pheidole and Dorymyrmex) were more common in disturbed sites. Furthermore, significant differences were found in the DRE between ant species and site types, suggesting specificity in the provision of dispersal services. Conclusions Topsoil removal affected removal proportions, DRE and ant-diaspore interaction network structure. The lack of diaspore dispersal towards disturbed sites indicates that soil removal affects secondary seed removal dynamics, impeding recovery potential.

Here, we estimate four plant species network structural metrics (interaction strength, weighted degree, closeness centrality, and specialization level), commonly used to describe their importance within plant-pollinator networks, at two different sites, and evaluate their effects on pollen deposition and pollen tube success. We found a positive effect of plant-pollinator specialization and a negative effect of closeness centrality on heterospecific pollen load size. We also found a marginal negative effect of closeness centrality on pollen tube success. Our results suggest that increasing plant-pollinator specialization within nested communities (pollinated by one or very few generalist insect species) may result in high levels of heterospecific pollen transfer. Furthermore, the differential effects of plant-pollinator network metrics on pollination success (pollen receipt and pollen tube success), highlight the need to integrate quantity (e.g. visitation rate) and quality (e.g. pollen delivery) aspects of pollination to achieve a more mechanistic understanding of the relationship between plant-pollinator network structure and function. Such knowledge is key to evaluate the resilience and stability of plant-pollinator communities and the services they provide in the face of increasing human disturbances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,1432-1939,,,,APR,2020,192,4,,,,,1037,1045,,10.1007/s00442-020-04637-5,,,,,,,WOS:000526455200015,32274585,,,,,

As such, connectivity to locations used by humans may influence the likelihood of invasion. Moreover, connectivity in freshwater ecosystems may follow the hydrological network. Here we tested whether multiple forms of connectivity to human recreational activities promotes biological invasion of freshwater ecosystems. Location England, UK. Time period 1990-2018. Major taxa studied One hundred and twenty-six non-native freshwater birds, crustaceans, fish, molluscs and plants. Methods Machine learning was used to predict spatial gradients in human recreation and two high risk activities for invasion (fishing and water sports). Connectivity indices were developed for each activity, in which human influence decayed from activity hotspots according to Euclidean distance (spatial connectivity) or hydrological network distance (downstream, upstream and along-channel connectivity). Generalized linear mixed models identified the connectivity type most associated to invasive species richness of each group, while controlling for other anthropogenic and environmental drivers. Results Connectivity to humans generally had stronger positive effects on invasion than all other drivers except recording effort. Recreation had stronger influence than urban land cover, and for most groups high risk activities had stronger effects than general recreation. Downstream human connectivity was most important for invasion by most of the groups, potentially reflecting predominantly hydrological dispersal. An exception was birds, for which spatial connectivity was most important, possibly because of overland dispersal capacity. Main conclusions These findings support the hypothesis that freshwater invasion is partly determined by an interaction between human activity and species dispersal in the hydrological network. By comparing alternative connectivity types for different human activities, our approach could enable robust inference of specific pathways and spread mechanisms associated with particular taxa. This would provide evidence to support better prioritization of surveillance and management for invasive non-native species.",,,,"Carvalho, Laurence/D-3276-2009; Pringle, Henrietta/U-5328-2019; Thackeray, Stephen J/D-2415-2013; Chapman, Daniel/C-2900-2008","Carvalho, Laurence/0000-0002-9768-9902; Pringle, Henrietta/0000-0001-8528-9138; Thackeray, Stephen J/0000-0003-3274-2706; Chapman, Daniel/0000-0003-1836-4112",,,,,,,,,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,APR,2020,29,4,,,,,645,655,,10.1111/geb.13051,,,,,,,WOS:000517213200004,,,,,,

Network theory provides a useful framework to study communities, by simultaneously considering species composition and the interactions among species. In this study, I use mixed-species flocks as model systems to gain insights on community and network structure. Specifically, I use co-occurrence network analyses to explore if avian mixed-species flocks change in richness and composition and/or in network structure and pair-wise associations, across elevations in the tropical Andes of Bolivia. Networks of flocking species changed both in composition and in the frequency and realization of pair-wise interactions across elevations, but changes in pair-wise associations explained most of network turnover along elevation. Pair-wise interactions changed rapidly, with shared species changing in position and importance within the network. Network dissimilarity was mostly explained by changes in the nature of associations rather than by differences in composition. Altogether, results show that montane mixed-species flocks are composed of loosely connected species and that most species have the potential of switching associations, often increasing in association strength at high elevations (up to 3150 m). Networks increased in connectivity and cohesion with elevation; flocks in lower elevations had more connections and these were less even. Above 3150 m a.s.l., there was rapid decay suggesting that flocks above this critical point are less connected and cohesive. This study exemplifies how combining community, network and pair-wise analyses can provide a more holistic view on the responses of species and assemblages to environmental gradients.",,,,"Montano-Centellas, Flavia/K-8046-2019","Montano-Centellas, Flavia/0000-0003-3115-3950",,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,JUN,2020,43,6,,,,,930,942,,10.1111/ecog.05135,,MAR 2020,,,,,WOS:000522055600001,,,,,,

Such impacts can modify the functional structure of fish communities, although the exact consequences of anthropic land-use changes can be context-dependent. This study investigated the influence of different land-use classes on the functional structure of fish communities in 32 headwater streams from southern Brazil. Trait composition and indices of functional diversity of the fish community were related to four land-use classes: native forest vegetation, silviculture, agriculture, and urban areas. Streams surrounded by larger areas of native forest were characterized by the predominance of foraging specialist species like grazers. However, as native vegetation is replaced by agriculture and urban areas, specialist species are replaced by species with generalist diet like detritivores. In streams surrounded by larger areas of agriculture, functional richness and divergence increased, while functional evenness decreased. Most likely, these changes were induced by alterations in the water quality, indicated by increased electrical conductivity and water temperature in streams with more agriculture areas. In conclusion, the conservation of the native forest vegetation is essential to maintain habitat characteristics and ecological processes in streams and to avoid the loss of specialist species in fish communities.",,,,"Pires, Mateus Marques/L-1734-2017","Pires, Mateus Marques/0000-0002-5728-8733",,,,,,,,,,,,0364-152X,1432-1009,,,,MAY,2020,65,5,,,,,618,629,,10.1007/s00267-020-01274-9,,MAR 2020,,,,,WOS:000518242800002,32130463,,,,,

Here, we examined the role of plant species in a plant-pollinator network across the entire flowering season and across dune and adjacent woodland habitats in Wisconsin, USA. We found strong turnover of plants, pollinators, and their interactions in time and space. Both native and exotic species play important structural roles in plant-pollinator networks. Simulations reveal that the loss of the early-flowering rare plant, Cirsium pitcheri, would result in a disproportionate loss of pollinator species.

Land conservancies and government agencies are interested in identifying areas to protect populations, while some timber companies wish to manage forests to minimize impacts on Canada Warbler and potentially create future habitat. We developed seven conservation planning scenarios using Zonation software to prioritize candidate areas for permanent land conservation (4 scenarios) or responsible forest management (minimizing species removal during forest harvesting while promoting colonization of regenerated forest; 3 scenarios). Factors used to prioritize areas included Canada Warbler population density, connectivity to protected areas, future climate suitability, anthropogenic disturbance, and recent Canada Warbler observations. We analyzed each scenario for three estimates of natal dispersal distance (5, 10, and 50 km). We found that scenarios assuming large dispersal distances prioritized a few large hotspots, while low dispersal distance scenarios prioritized smaller, broadly distributed areas. For all scenarios, efficiency (proportion of current Canada Warbler population retained per unit area) declined with higher dispersal distance estimates and inclusion of climate change effects in the scenario. Using low dispersal distance scenarios in decision-making offers a more conservative approach to maintaining this species at risk.

Here we first provide a detailed quantitative overview of the diversity and structure of the Marble Canyon Burgess Shale locality based on 16,438 specimens. Located 40 km southeast of the Walcott Quarry in Kootenay National Park (British Columbia), Marble Canyon represents the youngest site of the thick Stephen Formation.

Marble Canyon shows significant temporal changes in both taxonomic and ecological groups, suggesting periods of stasis followed by rapid turnover patterns at local and short temporal scales. At wider geographic and temporal scales, the different Burgess Shale sites occupy distinct areas in multivariate space.

The wider Azores region, hosting EMHs of all key groups of vulnerable or endangered vertebrate marine megafauna, is a singular EMH hotspot on a migratory crossroads, linking eastern and western Atlantic margins and productive boreal waters to tropical seas.

Artificial hard substrate, such as that associated with oil and gas platforms, provides settlement opportunities for species adapted to hard substrates in areas of soft sediment. The contribution of artificial hard substrate and the consequences of its removal (e.g. through decommissioning) to marine connectivity is not clear, yet such information is vital to inform marine spatial planning and future policy decisions on the use and protection of marine resources. This study demonstrates the application of a social network analysis approach to quantify and describe the ecological connectivity, informed by particle tracking model outputs, of hard substrate marine communities in the North Sea. Through comparison of networks with and without artificial hard substrate, and based on hypothetical decommissioning scenarios, this study provides insight into the contribution of artificial hard substrate, and the consequence of decommissioning, to the structure and function of marine community connectivity. This study highlights that artificial hard substrate, despite providing only a small proportion of the total area of hard substrate, increases the geographic extent and connectivity of the hard substrate network, bridging gaps, thereby providing 'stepping stones' between otherwise disconnected areas of natural hard substrate. Compared to the baseline scenario, a decommissioning scenario with full removal of oil and gas platforms results in a nearly 60% reduction in connectivity. Such reduction in connectivity may have negative implications for species' distribution, gene flow and resilience following disturbance or exploitation of marine hard substrate communities.

Social network analysis is a powerful quantitative tool for assessing the social structure formed by associations between individuals. However, demographic processes are rarely accounted for in such analyses. Here, we summarize how the structure of animal social networks is shaped by the joint effects of social behavior and turnover of individuals and suggest how a deeper understanding of these processes can open new, exciting avenues for research. Death or dispersal can have the direct effect of removing an individual and all its social connections, and can also have indirect effects, spurring changes in the distribution of social connections between remaining individuals. Recruitment and integration of juveniles and immigrant into existing social networks are critical to the emergence and persistence of social network structure. Together, these behavioral responses to loss and gain of social partners may impact how societies respond to seasonal or catastrophic turnover events. The fitness consequences of social position (e.g., survival and reproductive rates) may also create feedback between the social network structure and demography. Understanding how social structure changes in response to turnover of individuals requires further integration between long-term field studies and network modeling methods.

These novel stressors can affect diverse aspects of organismal function, including development of condition-dependent ornaments, which play critical roles in social and sexual selection. We investigated the relationship between metal pollution, proximity to roads, and carotenoid- and melanin-based plumage coloration in a common songbird, the great tit (Parus major). We studied populations located across a well-characterized metal pollution gradient and surrounded by roadway networks. Metal exposure and road-associated pollution could reduce carotenoid-based pigmentation by inducing oxidative stress or affecting habitat quality, but metals could also enhance melanin-based pigmentation, through effects on melanogenesis and testosterone concentrations. Using a large sample size (N> 500), we found that birds residing close to a point source for metals had reduced ultraviolet chroma, a component of carotenoid-based pigmentation. Moreover, birds with high feather metal concentrations had lower carotenoid chroma, hue, and ultraviolet chroma, with effects modified by age class. Birds residing closer to roads also had lower carotenoid chroma and hue. Melanin-based pigmentation showed high between-year repeatability, and no association with anthropogenic pollution. Results suggest that carotenoid-, but not melanin-, based pigmentation is negatively affected by multiple anthropogenic stressors. We are the first to demonstrate a negative association between roads and a plumage-based signaling trait, which could have important implications for sexual signaling dynamics in urban landscapes.

Even less information is available to characterize species' behavioral responses to roads. Although research shows that maned wolves (Chrysocyon brachyurus) in Brazil are experiencing considerable fragmentation and road mortality, the degree to which these disturbances are impacting the species' viability is unknown. The goal of this study was to analyze the potential effects of roads on maned wolf population size and structure. We used a simulation model to evaluate the population-scale consequences of individual maned wolf interactions with roads, which can result in road crossing, avoidance, or mortality due to a collision with a vehicle. We also forecasted where in Brazil these impacts might be most significant. Our model incorporated species demographic and movement parameters, plus habitat quality and a map of the road network. We found that even moderate rates of road mortality led to severe declines in population size, and that four specific locations accounted for a disproportionate fraction of roadkill events. Our approach will be generally useful for evaluating the relative importance of road effects on species conservation in many ecological systems, for prioritizing data collection efforts, and for informing conservation policies and mitigation strategies.",,,,"Grilo, Clara/H-2002-2012","Grilo, Clara/0000-0001-9870-3115",,,,,,,,,,,,0169-2046,1872-6062,,,,JAN,2020,193,,,,,,,,103672,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2019.103672,,,,,,,WOS:000496895900005,31942086,,,,,

Contrasting impacts of humans versus lynx on diel activity of roe deer across EuropeMots-cles,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Humans, as super predators, can have strong effects on wildlife behaviour, including profound modifications of diel activity patterns. Subsequent to the return of large carnivores to human-modified ecosystems, many prey species have adjusted their spatial behaviour to the contrasting landscapes of fear generated by both their natural predators and anthropogenic pressures. The effects of predation risk on temporal shifts in diel activity of prey, however, remain largely unexplored in human-dominated landscapes. We investigated the influence of the density of lynx Lynx lynx, a nocturnal predator, on the diel activity patterns of their main prey, the roe deer Capreolus capreolus, across a gradient of human disturbance and hunting at the European scale. Based on 11 million activity records from 431 individually GPS-monitored roe deer in 12 populations within the EURODEER network (), we investigated how lynx predation risk in combination with both lethal and non-lethal human activities affected the diurnality of deer. We demonstrated marked plasticity in roe deer diel activity patterns in response to spatio-temporal variations in risk, mostly due to human activities. In particular, roe deer decreased their level of diurnality by a factor of 1.37 when the background level of general human disturbance was high. Hunting exacerbated this effect, as during the hunting season deer switched most of their activity to night-time and, to a lesser extent, to dawn, although this pattern varied noticeably in relation to lynx density. Indeed, in the presence of lynx, their main natural predator, roe deer were relatively more diurnal. Overall, our results revealed a strong influence of human activities and the presence of lynx on diel shifts in roe deer activity. In the context of the recovery of large carnivores across Europe, we provide important insights about the effects of predators on the behavioural responses of their prey in human-dominated ecosystems. Modifications in the temporal partitioning of ungulate activity as a response to human activities may facilitate human-wildlife coexistence, but likely also have knock-on effects for predator-prey interactions, with cascading effects on ecosystem functioning.",,,,"Cagnacci, Francesca/L-7377-2013; Bonnot, Nadege/N-1762-2019; Heurich, Marco/O-4653-2014; Ciuti, Simone/D-7283-2013","Cagnacci, Francesca/0000-0002-4954-9980; Bonnot, Nadege/0000-0002-8717-231X; Heurich, Marco/0000-0003-0051-2930; Morellet, Nicolas/0000-0002-4274-7044; De Groeve, Johannes/0000-0002-1274-3237; Berger, Anne/0000-0001-5765-8039; Gehr, Benedikt/0000-0002-1044-9296; Ciuti, Simone/0000-0003-1052-9509",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JAN,2020,89,1,,,,,132,145,,10.1111/1365-2656.13161,,DEC 2019,,,,,WOS:000504353500001,31799691,,,,,

However, little is known concerning how the local ecological setting where plant-frugivore interactions take place affects the seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) and, eventually, plant recruitment. This knowledge gap relates to the scarcity of empirical investigations on individual-based plant-frugivore networks. We assessed whether the assembly of interaction modes (antagonist and mutualist) of the dwarf palm Chamaerops humilis (Arecaeae) affect the individual and the population level SDE in two Mediterranean sites differing in perturbation levels. We analysed the frequency distribution of interaction typologies and test its relationship with variation among individual palms in SDE. Additionally, we document how variation in interaction motif frequency (e.g. overrepresented interaction typologies) relates to changes in the SDE landscape of both disturbed study sites. We found that the interaction typologies of individual palms and its frugivores did not occur randomly. In a more complex landscape, interactions were more diverse and less dominated by simpler typologies, which may increase the stability of the plant-disperser interaction over the long term. We demonstrate that plants that interact with a more complex assemblage of frugivores, including both mutualistic and antagonistic partners, had the highest probability of recruitment. We found that the highly variable SDE among individual palms resulted from a few interaction modes occurring at higher than expected frequencies. We suggest this may be a reasonably frequent situation in diversified frugivore assemblages with a high heterogeneity of functional effects among mutualistic and antagonistic partners.",,,,"Fedriani, Jose/R-1328-2018; Jacome-Flores, Miguel/K-2299-2017","Fedriani, Jose/0000-0002-1581-2621; Jacome-Flores, Miguel/0000-0003-1504-7920",,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,MAR,2020,129,3,,,,,367,379,,10.1111/oik.06688,,DEC 2019,,,,,WOS:000504047800001,,,,,,

Yet this functionality may be threatened by increasing habitat loss, defaunation, and fragmentation. However, generalist species, and their interactions, can benefit from the habitat change caused by human disturbance while more specialized interactions mostly disappear. Therefore, changes in the structure of the local, within fragment, networks can be expected. Here we investigated how the structure of seed dispersal networks changes along a gradient of increasing habitat fragmentation. We analyzed 16 bird seed dispersal assemblages from forest fragments of a biodiversity-rich ecosystem. We found significant species-, interaction-, and network-area relationships, yet the later was determined by the number of species remaining in each community. The number of frugivorous bird and plant species, their interactions, and the number of links per species decreases as area is lost in the fragmented landscape. In contrast, network nestedness has a negative relationship with fragment area, suggesting an increasing generalization of the network structure in the gradient of fragmentation. Network specialization was not significantly affected by area, indicating that some network properties may be invariant to disturbance. Still, the local extinction of partner species, paralleled by a loss of interactions and specialist-specialist bird-plant seed dispersal associations, suggests the functional homogenization of the system as area is lost.

J,"Farine, DR",,,,"Farine, Damien R.",,,Structural trade-offs can predict rewiring in shrinking social networks,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"There is growing evidence that organisms can respond to declining population sizes by adapting their interactions with others. Regulating connections with others could underpin resilience of biological networks spanning from social groups to ecological communities. However, our ability to predict the dynamics of shrinking social networks remains limited. Network regulation involves several trade-offs. Removing nodes (and therefore their connections) from networks reduces the number of connections among remaining nodes. Responding by forming new connections then impacts other network properties. A simple way to minimize the impact of up-regulating network connections is to form new connections or to strengthen connections, between nodes that share a lost connection with a recently removed node. I propose a simple 'second-degree rewiring' rule as a biologically plausible regulatory mechanism in shrinking social networks. I argue that two individuals that have lost a connection with a common removed individual will both be more likely, or more willing, to form a new, or strengthen an existing, connection among themselves. I then show that such second-degree rewiring has less impact on important structural properties of the network than forming random new connections. For example, in a network with phenotypic assortment, second-degree nodes are more likely to be similar than any random pair of nodes, and connecting these will better maintain assortativity. This simple rule can therefore maintain network properties without individuals having any knowledge of the global structure of the network or the relative properties of the nodes within it. In this paper, I outline an algorithm for second-degree rewiring. I demonstrate how second-degree rewiring can have less impact than adding new, or increasing the strength of, random connections on both the individual and whole network properties. That is, relative to randomly adding or strengthening connections, second-degree rewiring has less impact on mean degree, assortativity, clustering and network density. I then demonstrate empirically, using social networks of great tits (Parus major), that individuals that previously shared connections to a removed conspecific were more likely to form a new connection or to strengthen their connection, relative to other individuals in the same population. This study highlights how developing a better mechanistic understanding of the structural properties of networks, and the consequences of adding new connections, can provide useful insights into how organisms are likely to regulate their interactions in shrinking populations.",,,,"Farine, Damien R./Y-2454-2019","Farine, Damien R./0000-0003-2208-7613",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/1365-2656.13140,,DEC 2019,,,,,WOS:000500166100001,31691962,,,,,

Although the tawny owl is not threatened at European or global scale, it is often found roadkilled. We studied the effects of different road types on tawny owl abundance in southern Portugal, from 2005 to 2016. In woodlands far from roads, we found high tawny owl abundance, a stable population trend, and low variation in site occupancy. On the contrary, main roads disrupted habitat quality for tawny owls-limiting their abundance and site occupancy and leading to a negative population trend due to disturbance and/or mortality. Secondary roads did not severely disrupt habitat quality, allowing initial occupation and relatively high densities, yet they may act as ecological traps, revealing instability in occupation along the breeding season and a negative population trend. Tawny owl individuals may settle near secondary roads while waiting for a vacant space in woodlands far from roads (the prime high-quality habitats).

We constructed visitation networks of bees to five native plant species in experimental research plots, in the presence and absence of an invasive thistle and while varying thistle abundance and time/duration of introduction. Species introduction did not change the visitation rate of bees to co-occurring native plants, or the interaction structure between the native plant species and bee visitors; seed set of a focal native plant species was also unaffected. We found the number of bee species with which the introduced species interacted (generality) correlated with significant increases in unweighted and weighted average degree, nestedness, and connectance, but not modularity. When comparing the impact of the introduced species either early or late in the season, we found similar relationships between introduced species generality and weighted and unweighted average degree and connectance; there was a significant negative relationship between introduced species generality and modularity early in the season, and a significant positive relationship with nestedness late in the season, suggesting introduction timing within a season may affect some measures differently.

However, how networks of interacting species respond to these changes remains poorly understood. We described aquatic food webs using invertebrate and fish community composition, functional traits and stable isotopes from twelve agricultural streams along a landscape disturbance gradient. We predicted that excessive deposition of fine inorganic sediment (sedimentation) associated with agricultural activities would negatively influence aquatic trophic diversity (e.g. reduced vertical and horizontal trophic niche breadths). We hypothesized that multiple mechanisms might cause trophic niche 'compression', as indicated by changes in realized trophic roles. Food-web properties based on consumer stable isotope data (delta C-13 and delta N-15) showed that increasing sediment disturbance was associated with reduced trophic diversity. In particular, the aquatic invertebrate community occupied a smaller area in isotopic niche space along the sedimentation gradient that was best explained by a narrowing of the invertebrate community delta C-13 range. Decreased niche partitioning, driven by increasing habitat homogeneity, environmental filtering and resource scarcity all seemingly lead to greater trophic equivalency caused by the collapse of the autochthonous food-web channel. Bayesian mixing-model analyses supported this contention with invertebrate consumers increasingly reliant on detritus along the sedimentation gradient, and predatory invertebrates relying more on the prey using these basal resources. The narrowing of the fish community delta C-13 range along the sedimentation gradient contributed to an apparent 'trophic shift' towards terrestrial carbon, further indicating the loss of the autochthonous food-web channel. On the vertical trophic niche axis, fish became increasingly separated from aquatic invertebrates with an increase in their estimated trophic position. In combination, these responses were most likely mediated through reduced fish densities and a diminished reliance on aquatic prey. Although species losses remain a major threat to ecosystem integrity, the functional roles of biota that persist dictate how food webs and ecosystem functioning respond to environmental change. Sedimentation was associated with nonlinear reductions in trophic diversity which could affect the functioning and stability of aquatic ecosystems. Our study helps explain how multiple mechanisms may radically reshape food-web properties in response to this type of disturbance.",,,,"McIntosh, Angus/B-2992-2011; Burdon, Francis J./ABC-2827-2020; Harding, Jon S./A-2578-2014","McIntosh, Angus/0000-0003-2696-8813; Harding, Jon S./0000-0002-1070-1594",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,MAR,2020,89,3,,,,,730,744,,10.1111/1365-2656.13142,,NOV 2019,,,,,WOS:000498855200001,31691281,,,,,

We evaluate the additive and combined effects of chronic anthropogenic disturbance (CAD) and rainfall variation on the temporal stability of mutualistic EFN-bearing plant-ant networks in a Caatinga dry forest. We evaluated whether changes in the stability of these interactions are driven by changes in the stability of the communities of partners involved and/or in ant behavior. We sampled EFN-bearing plant-ant networks in sixteen 20 x 20 m plots distributed across CAD and rainfall gradients. The stability of EFN-bearing plant and attendant-ant communities were measured as the inverse of temporal differences in their community structure and composition. We also computed the stability of EFN-bearing plant-ant networks by measuring the inverse of temporal differences in network specialization metrics. We found that, in general, the structure and composition of plant and ant interacting communities were similarly stable along both environmental gradients. Only CAD and its interaction with rainfall affected the temporal stability of EFN-bearing plant diversity, which declined as CAD increased, with a more pronounced relationship in wetter areas. However, variation in levels of CAD and, to a lesser extent, rainfall greatly modulated the stability of EFN-bearing plant-ant network specialization. CAD reduced the stability of network generality (specialization at the ant level), an effect that was much stronger in wetter areas. Meanwhile, the stability in network vulnerability (specialization at the plant level) decreased with the increase of CAD and the decrease of rainfall levels. Finally, there was a trend of decreasing stability in specialization of the overall network with increasing CAD.

However, few studies have examined the combined effects of multiple drivers, partitioned their impacts, or established threshold values that may trigger shifts in benthic cover. Inshore fringing reefs of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) occur in high-sediment, high-nutrient environments and are under increasing pressure from multiple acute and chronic stressors. Despite world-leading management, including networks of no-take marine reserves, relative declines in hard coral cover of 40-50% have occurred in recent years, with localized but persistent shifts from coral to macroalgal dominance on some reefs. Here we use boosted regression tree analyses to test the relative importance of multiple biophysical drivers on coral and macroalgal cover using a long-term (12-18 yr) data set collected from reefs at four island groups. Coral and macroalgal cover were negatively correlated at all island groups, and particularly when macroalgal cover was above 20%. Although reefs at each island group had different disturbance-and-recovery histories, degree heating weeks (DHW) and routine wave exposure consistently emerged as common drivers of coral and macroalgal cover. In addition, different combinations of sea-surface temperature, nutrient and turbidity parameters, exposure to high turbidity (primary) floodwater, depth, grazing fish density, farming damselfish density, and management zoning variously contributed to changes in coral and macroalgal cover at each island group.

Animal-mediated pollination is critical for sustaining agricultural economies and biodiversity, yet stands to lose both from present exposure to natural hazards, and future climate-driven shifts in their distribution, frequency, and intensity. In contrast to the depth of knowledge available for anthropogenic-related threats, our understanding of how naturally occurring extreme events impact pollinators and pollination has not yet been synthesized. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the potential impacts of natural hazards on pollinators and pollination in natural and cultivated systems. From a total of 117 studies (74% of which were observational), we found evidence of community and population-level impacts to plants and pollinators from seven hazard types, including climatological (extreme heat, fire, drought), hydrological (flooding), meteorological (hurricanes), and geophysical (volcanic activity, tsunamis). Plant and pollinator response depended on the type of natural hazard and level of biological organization observed; 19% of cases reported no significant impact, whereas the majority of hazards held consistent negative impacts. However, the effects of fire were mixed, but taxa specific; meta-analysis revealed that bee abundance and species richness tended to increase in response to fire, differing significantly from the mainly negative response of Lepidoptera. Building from this synthesis, we highlight important future directions for pollination-focused natural hazard research, including the need to: (a) advance climate change research beyond static mean-level changes by better incorporating shock events; (b) identify impacts at higher levels of organization, including ecological networks and co-evolutionary history; and (c) address the notable gap in crop pollination services research-particularly in developing regions of the world.

Yet metrics for calibrating these impacts and measuring an ecosystem's capacity to recover are lacking. Highway construction in 1989 to bypass Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park in California resulted in storm-driven infusion of exposed sediments into five streams; five nearby streams that were not intersected by the bypass construction were not affected by this event and served as controls for a natural experiment. A second large storm event in 1995 contributed sediment loads into all ten streams resulting in a disturbance gradient that allowed us to examine the effects of repeated sediment disturbances. We evaluated the impacts of these stresses on three resident stream amphibian species in 1990 and again in 1996. In 1990, the impacted streams had sixfold higher pool sediment loads and significantly lower larval tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) densities and lower densities of coastal giant salamanders (Dicamptodon tenebrosus) and southern torrent salamanders (Rhyacotriton variegatus) compared with the un-impacted streams. During the six years between these storm events, pool bowl sediment loads increased 14-fold in the previously un-impacted streams and threefold in the previously impacted streams. Larval tailed frogs and torrent salamanders further declined in both sets of streams in 1996 although non-significantly. In contrast, giant salamander densities increased in both stream sets. Of the three species, giant salamanders appeared the most resistant to the depositional events, while the other two species appeared to decline relative to the intensity of the sediment disturbances but still persist. We believe these results demonstrate the usefulness of these three amphibians as metrics for measuring the effects of this common disturbance type on the ecological resilience of stream networks in this and other temperate northwest forest ecosystems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,OCT,2019,10,10,,,,,,,e02886,10.1002/ecs2.2886,,,,,,,WOS:000493528200021,,,,,,

We examined the composition, structure and function of nest webs between two endangered old-growth forests representing the last remnants of the ancient coniferous family Araucariaceae in South America: pewen (Araucaria araucana; Endangered) in temperate Chile (2010-2018), and Parana pine (Araucaria angustifolia; Critically Endangered) in subtropical Argentina (2006-2018). Pewen and Parana pine accounted for 30 and 9% of forest basal area, but only 2 and 5% of nesting cavities, respectively. Instead, cavity-nesting birds and mammals nested disproportionately in coexisting broadleaf trees. Species richness, interaction richness, and mean number of links per species were much higher in Parana pine forest than in pewen forest, but the two nest webs had similar levels of evenness and nestedness. Most secondary cavity-nesting species depended on cavities formed by decay in Nothofagus spp. (98% of nest cavities in pewen forest) or Apuleia leiocarpa (26% of nest cavities in Parana pine forest). An exception was the globally endangered Vinaceous Parrot, a Parana pine seed disperser, which made 50% of its nests in decay-formed cavities in Parana pine.

Connectivity is often regarded as a static property of a migratory network and visualized to evaluate the vulnerability of migratory populations to changes in specific regions. However, if the network itself is a dynamical system, its connectivity can be an output of the system that may be changed by perturbations to the network. I constructed a regulated, tripartite network population model with breeding, winter, and migration route nodes that also includes natal dispersal and in which connectivity goes to a dynamical equilibrium. I investigated how natal dispersal as well as the strength of density-dependent population regulation during breeding and non-breeding seasons affects connectivity patterns and the responses of the network population to simulated habitat loss. I found that when the population is primarily regulated by availability of habitat in only one season and natal dispersal was geographically constrained, connectivity patterns were unsymmetrical with weak (diffuse) connectivity from the non-regulating to regulating season and stronger connectivity in the other direction. Less-constrained natal dispersal always resulted in weak connectivity throughout. The overall magnitude of declines caused by habitat loss was determined by relative regulation and generally was not affected by natal dispersal although it was possible, with high natal dispersal, for loss of low-quality nodes in a non-regulating season to cause increases in network population size since the low-quality nodes were acting as an ecological trap. Although we expect that localness (i.e., the extent to which declines resulting from local winter habitat loss was concentrated in a small breeding area vs. spread across a larger area) should be predicted by connectivity, localness was in fact hugely variable and affected by both density-dependence and natal dispersal and generally quite difficult to predict from the connectivity pattern. In summary, the complexity of the system meant that visualization of a network by itself, without knowledge of the underlying processes causing connectivity patterns, often does not provide a good indication of the vulnerability of the network or individual node populations to habitat loss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,SEP 24,2019,7,,,,,,,,354,10.3389/fevo.2019.00354,,,,,,,WOS:000488117200001,,,,,,

Major taxa studied Vascular plants. Method We collated 70 million occurrence records of 180,000 species of vascular plants from three biodiversity data-sharing networks. We combined these with data on changes in global land use to find locations (0.25 degrees grid cells) with biodiversity data before and after loss of natural habitat. First, we examined the change in community median range size before and after habitat loss. Second, we quantified the probabilities of local persistence of small- and large-ranged species at different levels of habitat loss. Results Community median range size was higher after habitat loss, on average. Species with small ranges had lower probabilities of persistence than species with large ranges at already moderate habitat loss (<= 50%). Main conclusions The loss of natural habitat has a differential effect on the local extinction risk of species with different range sizes. Given that species with small ranges decline preferentially, habitat loss can create a linkage between temporal and spatial species turnover, in that changes within communities decrease compositional differences between communities.",,,,"Navarro, Laetitia M./U-1899-2017; Pereira, Henrique Miguel/B-3975-2009","Navarro, Laetitia M./0000-0003-1099-5147; Pereira, Henrique Miguel/0000-0003-1043-1675; Staude, Ingmar/0000-0003-2306-8780",,,,,,,,,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,JAN,2020,29,1,,,,,16,25,,10.1111/geb.13003,,SEP 2019,,,,,WOS:000486319600001,,,,,,

The study of pollination specialization by examining network properties and more recently incorporating predictors of pairwise interactions is emerging as a useful framework, yet integrated datasets combining network structure, habitat disturbance, and phylogenetic information are still scarce. Results We found that plant-pollinator interactions in a grassland ecosystem in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains are not randomly distributed and that high levels of reciprocal specialization are generated by biological constraints, such as floral symmetry, pollinator size and pollinator sociality, because these traits lead to morphological or phenological mismatching between interacting species. We also detected that landscape degradation was associated with differences in the network topology, but the interaction webs still maintained a consistently higher number of reciprocal specialization cases than expected. Evidence for the reciprocal evolutionary dependence in visitors (e.g., related pollinators visiting related plants) were weak in this study system, however we identified key species joining clustered units. Conclusions Our results indicate that the conserved links with keystone species may provide the foundation for generating local reciprocal specialization. From the general topology of the networks, plant-pollinators interactions in sites with disturbance consisted of generalized nodes connecting modules (i.e., hub and numerous connectors). Vice versa, interactions in less disturbed sites consisted of more specialized and symmetrical connections.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1472-6785,,,,SEP 6,2019,19,1,,,,,,,34,10.1186/s12898-019-0250-z,,,,,,,WOS:000484912700001,31492127,,,,,

Although numerous studies have examined the food web response to species loss, their response (e.g. in network topology and interaction frequency) to changes in species abundance has received little attention. We experimentally reduced the abundance (by c. 60%) of one host plant species (Saussurea nigrescens) in a tri-trophic micro-food web consisting of two common Asteraceae species (S. nigrescens and Anaphalis flavescens), their pre-dispersal seed predators (tephritid flies) and the parasitoid wasps that feed on these seed predators. The neutral process hypothesis posits that network topology and interaction frequency are determined by the relative abundances of the participating species. Accordingly, we hypothesized that interaction frequency (indicated by the rate of flies infesting plants and of parasitoid wasps parasitizing flies) would decrease with decreasing abundance of host plant abundance. Consistent with the neutral process hypothesis, abundance reduction significantly decreased the rate of generalist flies infesting the manipulated plant host species, but increased the rate on unmanipulated plant species. In contrast, abundance reduction significantly increased the rate of specialist flies infesting the manipulated species, but it had no demonstrable effect on the specialists on the unmanipulated plant host. Moreover, abundance reduction significantly increased the rate of parasitoid wasps (as a species group) parasitizing flies in the manipulated species, but decreased the rate of the unmanipulated species. These results were not attributable to neutral processes, but can be explained by adaptive foraging theory. In addition, experimental manipulation did not shift the qualitative presence-absence of the linkages in the micro-food web, and the change in the abundance of both fly and wasp species was smaller than the abundance changes of the manipulated plant species. Synthesis. Our results indicate that both neutral processes and/or adaptive foraging likely contributed to food web stability in responses to changes in species abundance. Because species abundance is vulnerable to abiotic and biotic environmental changes, we suggest more research should be conducted to understand how food webs respond to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance.",,,,,"Vazquez, Diego P./0000-0002-3449-5748",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,MAR,2020,108,2,,,,,415,423,,10.1111/1365-2745.13270,,SEP 2019,,,,,WOS:000485229000001,,,,,,

The theory predicts that the connectivity of scale-free networks should be particularly sensitive to the disturbance of highly connected nodes (i.e. hubs). This expectation relies on complete patch removal, thus restraining its application to the last of several steps involved in habitat fragmentation, and overlooks potential reconnection of patches after disturbance (i.e. rewiring). We performed a landscape-scale experiment to evaluate the robustness of scale-free spatial networks of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) to logging activity. We built caribou networks before and after disturbance using a mechanistic model of inter-patch movements and differentiated networks disturbed in their hubs and non-hubs. We applied a reaction-advection-diffusion model to networks before and after disturbance to account for the spatio-temporal dynamics of caribou movement within the networks and anticipate their space use. We validated network and space-use predictions using empirical estimates from GPS relocations of caribou. Using the validated predictions, we compared topological network measures before and after disturbance to quantify changes in connectivity within the networks according to the type of disturbed nodes (i.e. hubs or non-hubs) and assessed space-use reorganization. We used control networks, for which no disturbance occurred in the before-after timeframe of the study, in the latter analysis to get a baseline rate of change. Disturbances due to logging activity typically resulted in fragmentation and shrinkage instead of complete patch removal. Independently to the type of disturbed nodes, caribou rewired their network using remnant patches from the fragmentation process. Consequently, topological network measures generally did not differ between before and after disturbance, such that caribou networks displayed some robustness to logging activity due to the rewiring process. Space-use reorganization was greater, however, when hubs were disturbed in comparison with non-hubs and controls. Even though caribou rewired their networks, they revisited less patches after the disturbance of hubs. A naive application of network theory (i.e. without potential rewiring and using complete patch removal), to assess spatial network robustness, may be inappropriate during most steps of the fragmentation process because of the rewiring process. Indeed, network rewiring facilitated by the presence of remnant patches can enhance spatial network robustness, in comparison with no rewiring. In addition, species-specific functional connectivity should be accounted for when anticipating the rewiring process and animal space use within disturbed networks.

J,"Valdovinos, FS",,,,"Valdovinos, Fernanda S.",,,Mutualistic networks: moving closer to a predictive theory,ECOLOGY LETTERS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Plant-animal mutualistic networks sustain terrestrial biodiversity and human food security. Global environmental changes threaten these networks, underscoring the urgency for developing a predictive theory on how networks respond to perturbations. Here, I synthesise theoretical advances towards predicting network structure, dynamics, interaction strengths and responses to perturbations. I find that mathematical models incorporating biological mechanisms of mutualistic interactions provide better predictions of network dynamics. Those mechanisms include trait matching, adaptive foraging, and the dynamic consumption and production of both resources and services provided by mutualisms. Models incorporating species traits better predict the potential structure of networks (fundamental niche), while theory based on the dynamics of species abundances, rewards, foraging preferences and reproductive services can predict the extremely dynamic realised structures of networks, and may successfully predict network responses to perturbations. From a theoretician's standpoint, model development must more realistically represent empirical data on interaction strengths, population dynamics and how these vary with perturbations from global change.

Dale",,,Evolutionary histories impart structure into marine fish heterospecific co-occurrence networks,GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aim Understanding the role of interspecific interactions in maintaining diversity, ecosystem function and evolutionary processes is a major challenge in ecology. Historically, antagonistic heterospecific interactions were the focus of many studies, but the importance of facilitative interactions has become increasingly apparent over recent decades. Ecological networks can provide insights into potential interactions among co-occurring heterospecifics. We compared the structures of temperate and tropical marine fish co-occurrence networks to estimate their resilience and/or robustness to perturbations. Location Western Australia. Time period Present. Major taxa studied Marine fishes. Methods We compared the structure of temperate and tropical marine fish communities through interspecific co-occurrences using joint species distribution modelling. Network analyses identified modules of co-occurring species and those which play a strong role in the organization of communities. Results In all study locations, most interspecific co-occurrences did not differ significantly from random, with positive co-occurrences being more prevalent than negative non-random co-occurrences. The modularity of networks created from interspecific co-occurrences tended to decrease poleward, with the opposite for species centrality. An increase in functional diversity among co-occurring species with latitude was detected. Species centrality was greatest among the temperate endemic species, with a positive association between species centrality and intrinsic vulnerability scores. Main conclusions The differences in community structure between tropical and temperate Western Australian marine fish communities might be attributable, in part, to differing evolutionary histories. The temperate endemic species have co-evolved in a relatively homogeneous abiotic and biotic environment, whereas the Indo-Pacific ichthyofauna have evolved in a diverse range of environments. The temperate communities are characterized by: (a) low functional redundancy among co-occurring species, with endemic species playing keystone roles in community structure; (b) attributes associated with increased vulnerability to perturbations; with (c) many of the species identified as potential keystone species having high intrinsic vulnerability scores and being targeted by fishers.",,,,,"Ford, Benjamin/0000-0002-7609-7625",,,,,,,,,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,SEP,2019,28,9,,,,,1310,1324,,10.1111/geb.12934,,,,,,,WOS:000480584900009,,,,,,

It is therefore important to simultaneously study the impacts of global warming on interdependent taxa from different trophic levels. Here, we quantify current and potential future associations of functional diversity (based on multiple traits) and functional identity (based on individual traits) between interacting taxa using projection models under climate change. Location A tropical elevational gradient (500-3,500 m a.s.l.) in the Manu biosphere reserve, south-east Peru. Methods We investigated different scenarios of how species' elevational ranges might change under climate change based on projected future increases in mean annual temperature and current associations of species' elevational ranges with temperature. We computed the functional diversity and identity of current and potential future plant and bird communities based on morphological traits that have been shown to be important for plant-frugivore interactions. Finally, we tested for changes in the associations between projected functional diversity and identity of future plant and bird communities. Results Projected functional diversity of plants and birds decreased under range contraction and range shift scenarios at low elevations. At mid- and high elevations, functional diversity of both species groups increased most strongly under range expansion. Correspondence between plant and bird functional diversity was weakest under range contraction, while it remained strong under range expansion and shift. Similarly, the correspondence of projected plant and bird functional identity was weakest under a range contraction scenario. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that a scenario in which species are dispersal-limited and sensitive to increasing temperatures is likely to cause a functional mismatch between plant and bird communities along this tropical elevational gradient. This implies that certain functional types of plants could miss avian seed dispersers in the future. Our approach of studying functional diversity of interacting taxa could be more widely applied to identify potential future mismatches between trophic levels.",,,,"Nowak, Larissa/Y-1902-2019; Schleuning, Matthias/H-2154-2015","Nowak, Larissa/0000-0002-1910-8041; Schleuning, Matthias/0000-0001-9426-045X",,,,,,,,,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,SEP,2019,25,9,,,,,1362,1374,,10.1111/ddi.12946,,,,,,,WOS:000479067100002,,,,,,

However, with increasing levels of habitat fragmentation and pressures from climate change and overexploitation, surrounding landscapes also influence the persistence of species populations, and their effects are increasingly incorporated in conservation planning and management for both species and communities. Here, we present a framework based on metapopulation dynamics in fragmented landscapes, for quantifying the survival (resistance) and reestablishment of species populations following localized extinction events (resilience). We explore the application of this framework to guide the conservation of a group of threatened bird species endemic to papyrus (Cyperus papyrus) swamps in East and Central Africa. Using occupancy data for five species collected over two years from a network of wetlands in Uganda, we determine the local and landscape factors that influence local extinction and colonization, and map expected rates of population turnover across the network to draw inferences about the locations that contribute most to regional resistance and resilience for all species combined. Slight variation in the factors driving extinction and colonization between individual papyrus birds led to species-specific differences in the spatial patterns of site-level resistance and resilience. However, despite this, locations with the highest resistance and/or resilience overlapped for most species and reveal where resources could be invested for multispecies persistence. This novel simplified framework can aid decision making associated with conservation planning and prioritization for multiple species residing in overlapping, fragmented habitats; helping to identify key sites that warrant urgent conservation protection, with consideration of the need to adapt and respond to future change.",,,,"Wilson, Robert J/I-8726-2014","Wilson, Robert J/0000-0003-4477-7068; Donaldson, Lynda/0000-0002-1892-3941",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,DEC,2019,29,8,,,,,,,,10.1002/eap.1989,,AUG 2019,,,,,WOS:000483951200001,31376197,,,,,

Interaction modifications are well-established as generating strong non-trophic impacts by modulating the strength of interspecific interactions. For simplicity and comparison with direct interactions within a network context, the consequences of interaction modifications have often been described as direct pairwise interactions. The consequences of this assumption have not been examined in non-equilibrium settings where unexpected consequences of interaction modifications are most likely. To test the distinct dynamic nature of these higher-order effects, we directly compare, using dynamic simulations, the robustness to extinctions under perturbation of systems where interaction modifications are either explicitly modelled or represented by corresponding equivalent pairwise non-trophic interactions. Full, multi-species representations of interaction modifications resulted in a greater robustness to extinctions compared to equivalent pairwise effects. Explanations for this increased stability despite apparent greater dynamic complexity can be found in additional routes for dynamic feedbacks. Furthermore, interaction modifications changed the relative vulnerability of species to extinction from those trophically connected close to the perturbed species towards those receiving a large number of modifications. Future empirical and theoretical research into non-trophic effects should distinguish interaction modifications from direct pairwise effects in order to maximize information about the system dynamics.

Intense concentration of human activities and mass tourism are leading to coastal dune loss and fragmentation. Besides the loss and fragmentation of coastal dunes, mass tourism has considerably affected remnant natural areas. To prevent degradation of remnant natural areas, it is mandatory to understand whether, and under what conditions, tourism can be allowed. In the present study I addressed the problem by evaluating the impact of tourism on the structure and resilience of pollination networks in coastal dune ecosystems freely accessible to tourists. Pollination networks represent ecological community structure and depict interactions among species, providing the opportunity for a holistic assessment of ecosystem structure and functioning. I conducted the study on coastal dune sites of the North Adriatic coast, with different levels of touristic pressure. I recorded pollination interactions together with descriptors of human disturbance along sea-inland transects. A moderate level of human disturbance was positively related to the richness of animal-pollinated plant and pollinator species. Besides species richness, the resilience of pollination networks was also highest at moderate disturbance. By assessing the impact of human disturbance on coastal dune ecosystems from the perspective of pollination interactions, evidence arises that moderate disturbance and long-term conservation of pollination networks of coastal dunes can co-exist. However, to achieve this goal, tourism should be regulated, and visitor access to coastal sites managed, so as to prevent intense human disturbance from compromising both the structure and function of coastal dune ecosystems.",,,,"Fantinato, Edy/AAG-2572-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,AUG,2019,236,,,,,,70,78,,10.1016/j.biocon.2019.05.037,,,,,,,WOS:000483908400009,,,,,,

In shallow water environments, these pelagic rays often form groups and perform several apparently socially mediated behaviors. Group structures may result from active choices of individual rays to interact or passive processes. Social behavior is known to affect spatial ecology in other elasmobranchs, but this is the first study providing quantitative evidence for structured social relationships in manta rays. To construct social networks, we collected data from more than 500 groups of reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) over 5 years in the Raja Ampat Regency of West Papua. We used generalized affiliation indices to isolate social preferences from non-social associations, the first study on elasmobranchs to use this method. Longer lasting social preferences were detected mostly between female rays. We detected assortment of social relations by phenotype and variation in social strategies, with the overall social network divided into two main communities. Overall network structure was characteristic of a dynamic fission-fusion society, with differentiated relationships linked to strong fidelity to cleaning station sites.

To understand their influence, detailed knowledge about trophic relationships among species is critical. However, this requires both exceptional resolution in dietary assessments and sampling breadth within communities, especially for highly diverse, tropical ecosystems. We used gut content metabarcoding across a broad range of coral reef fishes (8 families, 22 species) in Mo'orea, French Polynesia, to test whether this technique has the potential to capture the structure of a hyperdiverse marine food web. Moreover, we explored whether taxonomic groups (families) and traditional, broad-scale trophic assignments explained fish diet across four different metrics of quantifying predator-prey interactions. Metabarcoding yielded a large number (4,341) of unique operational taxonomic units (i.e. prey) with high-resolution taxonomic assignments (i.e. often to the level of genus or species). We demonstrate that across multiple metrics, taxonomic group at the family level is a consistently better, albeit still weak, predictor of empirical trophic relationships than frequently used, broad-scale functional assignments. Our method also reveals a complex trophic network with fine-scale partitioning among species, further emphasizing the importance of examining fish diets beyond broad trophic categories. We demonstrate the capacity of metabarcoding to reconstruct diverse and complex food webs with exceptional resolution, a significant advancement from traditional food web reconstruction. Furthermore, this method allows us to pinpoint the trophic niche of species with niche-based modelling, even across hyperdiverse species assemblages such as coral reefs. In conjunction with complementary techniques such as stable isotope analysis, applying metabarcoding to whole communities will provide unparalleled information about energy and nutrient fluxes and inform their susceptibility to disturbances even in the world's most diverse ecosystems.",,,,"Morat, Fabien/U-2682-2019","Morat, Fabien/0000-0002-9925-1437; Meyer, Christopher/0000-0003-2501-7952; Casey, Jordan/0000-0002-2434-7207",,,,,,,,,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,,,AUG,2019,10,8,,,,,1157,1170,,10.1111/2041-210X.13206,,,,,,,WOS:000479111100004,,,,,,

This effort ought instead to rely on a combination of extensive data and inference. Here we investigate how the distribution of trophic interactions at the global scale shapes the marine fish food web structure. We hypothesize that the heterogeneous distribution of species ranges in biogeographic regions should concentrate interactions in the warmest areas and within species groups. We find that the inferred global metaweb of marine fish-that is, all possible potential feeding links between co-occurring species-is highly connected geographically with a low degree of spatial modularity. Metrics of network structure correlate with sea surface temperature and tend to peak towards the tropics.

Most studies investigating the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning focus on species richness, predominantly within the context of productivity-related functions. Consequently, there is limited understanding of how other biodiversity measures, such as species evenness (the distribution of abundance among species), affect complex multitrophic functions such as pollination. We explore the effect of species evenness on the ecosystem function of pollination using a controlled experiment with selected plants and insects in flight cages. We manipulated the relative abundances of plant and pollinator species, while holding species richness, composition, dominance order, and total abundance constant. Then, we tested how numerical species evenness affected network structure and consequently, seed production, in our artificial communities. Contrary to our expectation, numerical dominance in plant communities increased complementarity in pollinator use (reduced pollinator sharing) among plant species. As predicted by theory, this increased complementarity resulted in higher seed production for the most dominant and rare plant species in our cages. Our results show that in a controlled experiential setting, numerical species evenness can alter important aspects of plant-pollinator networks and plant reproduction, irrespective of species richness, composition, and total abundance.

Even for existing rice fields, physico-chemical disturbances, such as farmland consolidation and agrochemical application, also have negative effects on wetland biodiversity. For fish that inhabit rice fields for at least part of their life history, differences in water level between rice fields and irrigation ditches caused by irrigation system improvements are critical to their abundance by preventing their access. The ecological impact of differences in water level may extend to the foraging habits and trophic positions of the top predators in rice fields, resulting in the alteration of wetland food webs. Here, we investigated how physical disruptions to habitat networks affect food-web properties in rice-field ecosystems. We conducted stable nitrogen and carbon isotope analysis on a threatened giant water bug, Kirkaldyia deyrolli, to estimate its trophic position as an indicator of food-chain length. Based on field observations, we found that fish that were at a high trophic position were only available to K. deyrolli in rice fields where there were no physical barriers blocking access to the network of habitats, and the diets of K. deyrolli included fish prey (18%, based on visual observation). The stable isotope analysis revealed that the trophic position of K. deyrolli was significantly lower in rice fields with physical barriers (no fish/10 dips by a dip net) than in those without physical barriers (5.6 fish) due to the absence of fish in locations with barriers.

Fruit-eating vertebrates are no exception and use social information to find fruit, which may ultimately affect plant populations via seed dispersal. In many systems, mutualistic relationships between fruiting plants and frugivores are critical to maintain ecosystem functioning, especially in the tropics. On the island of OModified Letter Turned Commaahu, Hawaii, USA, all native, fruit-eating birds are extinct and several plant species are experiencing reduced recruitment likely due to a lack of seed dispersal. Over the years, numerous bird species, many of which are frugivorous, have been introduced to the island. Yet, introduced birds may not recognize native fruits as a resource and social information may be needed for introduced frugivores to target and feed on native fruits. We investigated whether social information, in the form of broadcasted bird vocalizations, of introduced birds could increase visitations and more importantly frugivory on focal fruiting plants. We also tested whether the visitation rates of introduced bird species to focal plants were influenced by conspecific and/or heterospecific vocalizations. We conducted 80 playback experiments at native and introduced fruiting plants, and compared responses to silent control periods. Four times as many frugivores were detected and 10 times more frugivory events were recorded at plants with broadcasted vocalizations compared to control periods. The Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus) exhibited the strongest response to both conspecific and heterospecific playbacks. White-eyes also consumed the most fruit from the widest array of plant species during trials. Introduced birds that use social information and readily identify novel resources may more effectively colonize new areas. We suggest that the White-eye's use of social information may help to support their robust population on OModified Letter Turned Commaahu. Ecosystems throughout the world are affected by the loss of mutualistic relationships, many of which provide valuable ecological services.

Our findings support the view that strong relationships between farming energy flows, agroecosystem functioning and biodiversity can be detected, and highlight the importance of farmers' knowledge and labour to maintain bio-cultural landscapes.

We examined the regional and local factors influencing lifetime productivity (number and richness of occupants) of individual tree cavities across two divergent forest ecosystems: temperate mixed forest in Canada and subtropical Atlantic Forest, Argentina. We predicted that (1) species would accumulate more rapidly within cavities in the species-rich system (Argentina: 76 species) than the poorer system (Canada: 31 species), (2) cavity characteristics associated with nest-site selection in short-term studies would predict lifetime cavity productivity, and (3) species would accumulate more rapidly across highly used cavities than across cavities used only once, and in Argentina than in Canada. We monitored and measured nesting cavities used by birds and mammals over 22 breeding seasons (1995-2016) in Canada and 12 breeding seasons (2006-2017) in Argentina. Cavities were used an average of 3.1 times by 1.7 species in Canada and 2.2 times by 1.4 species in Argentina. Species richness within cavities increased with number of nesting events at similar rates in Canada and Argentina, in both cases much slower than expected if within-cavity species assemblages were random, suggesting that lifetime richness of individual cavities is more strongly influenced by local ecological factors (nest site fidelity, nest niche) than by the regional species pool. The major determinant of lifetime cavity productivity was the cavity's life span. We found only weak or inconsistent relationships with cavity characteristics selected by individuals in short-term nest-site selection studies. Turnover among (vs. within) cavities was the primary driver of diversity at the landscape scale. In Canada, as predicted, species accumulation was fastest when sampling across high-use cavities. In Argentina, the rates of species accumulation were similar across high- and low-use cavities, and fastest when both high- and low-use cavities were pooled. These findings imply that biodiversity of cavity nesters is maintained by a mix of long-lived (highly productive, legacy trees) and many high-turnover (single-use, fast decaying) tree cavities. Conservation of both long-lasting and single-use cavities should be incorporated into decisions about stand-level forest management, regional land use policies, and reserve networks.",,,,,"Cockle, Kristina/0000-0002-6502-923X",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,JUL,2019,29,5,,,,,,,e01916,10.1002/eap.1916,,,,,,,WOS:000474485400004,31055863,,,,,

However, the efficacy of marine reserve networks in frequently disturbed systems, such as coral reefs, has rarely been evaluated. Here we analyze a well-mixed larval pool model and a spatially explicit model based on a well-documented coral trout (Plectropomus spp.) metapopulation in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, Australia, to determine the effects of marine reserve coverage and placement (in relation to larval connectivity and disturbance heterogeneity) on the temporal stability of fisheries yields and population biomass in environmentally disturbed systems. We show that marine reserves can contribute to stabilizing fishery yield while increasing metapopulation persistence, irrespective of whether reserves enhance or diminish average fishery yields. However, reserve placement and the level of larval connectivity among subpopulations were important factors affecting the stability and sustainability of fisheries and fish metapopulations. Protecting a mix of disturbed and non-disturbed reefs, rather than focusing on the least-disturbed habitats, was the most consistently beneficial approach across a range of dispersal and reserve coverage scenarios. Placing reserves only in non-disturbed areas was the most beneficial for biomass enhancement, but had variable results for fisheries and could potentially destabilize yields in systems with well-mixed larval or those that are moderately fished. We also found that focusing protection on highly disturbed areas could actually increase variability in yields and biomass, especially when degraded reef reserves were distant and poorly connected to the meta-population.

Additionally, we evaluated how body size and proboscis length of pollinators shifted along the gradient, and whether these changes were related to pollinator niche breadth. Location An elevational gradient (2,350-3,520 m a.s.l.) on the oceanic high-mountain strato-volcano of El Teide (Tenerife, Canary Islands). Taxon Flowering plant and pollinator species. Methods We compared quantitative plant-pollinator networks along the plant-diversity gradient. We calculated a set of niche-based topological metrics that capture the degree of specialization, niche breadth and niche overlap. Furthermore, we obtained beta-diversity measures and the proportion of replacement and richness components. Results There was an overall decline in species richness of pollinators with increasing elevation. This decline was mainly driven by the loss of species along the elevational gradient, which conformed a nested subset pattern. The whole network showed less specialization, greater connectance and lower modularity towards the summit. At high elevations, pollinators were more generalized and less selective in their flower choice, showing a greater trophic niche breadth compared to pollinators at lower elevations. Mean body size of pollinators increased with elevation, and species body size and proboscis length were positively associated with the number of plant species visited. Main conclusions Overall, results indicated that the elevational gradient filters pollinator species, probably according to their thermal tolerance and ability to exploit a wide range of trophic resources. The finding that pollinators become more generalized and opportunistic at higher elevations is a novel result, which may have implications for new research into how ecological networks vary over environmental gradients.

Beaver wetlands are complexes of newly created, mature, and abandoned beaver constructions within a stream network. Invertebrate dynamics across all habitats derived from these successional stages remains poorly explored. Here, we test how this natural successional gradient created by beaver affects invertebrate beta-diversity and its components (turnover and nestedness). Invertebrates were sampled in the Piedmont region of Georgia (U.S.A.) in two seasons (autumn and spring) in each of four stages of habitat succession: natural stream channels, forested wetlands created by newly formed beaver dams, mature open wetland marshes, and abandoned wetland meadows. In autumn, invertebrate communities were different among successional stages, apart from new versus abandoned wetlands and new versus mature wetlands, which were only marginally different, and streams versus abandoned wetlands. In spring, only the mature beaver wetland communities were unique, differing from both streams and from newly formed or abandoned wetlands. Beta-diversity was nearly twice as high for the overall study-system than any individual successional stage, which all had similar diversity. Additionally, turnover was significantly higher than nestedness in all stages. Community differences combined with high turnover among successional stages indicates that beaver wetland communities are not merely a subset of more stable mature wetlands or streams; instead, each stage has a different taxonomic make-up. Our results strengthen the idea that beaver activity can be an important conservation tool by contributing substantially to diversity in areas where they are present. Beaver wetlands have the potential to help stabilise beta- and regional diversity in the face of wetland loss from climate change and other human impacts.",,,,"Stenert, Cristina/AAD-6860-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,JUL,2019,64,7,,,,,1265,1274,,10.1111/fwb.13302,,,,,,,WOS:000471049400003,,,,,,

These changes in distribution are often associated with reduced population sizes and loss of genetic connectivity and diversity (i.e., genetic erosion) which may further diminish a species' ability to respond to changing environmental conditions and lead to local population extinctions. We studied threatened boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) populations across their distribution in Ontario/Manitoba (Canada) to assess changes in genetic diversity and connectivity in areas of high and low anthropogenic activity. Using data from >1,000 caribou and nine microsatellite loci, we assessed population genetic structure, genetic diversity, and recent migration rates using a combination of network and population genetic analyses. We used Bayesian clustering analyses to identify population genetic structure and explored spatial and temporal variation in those patterns by assembling networks based on R-ST and F-ST as historical and contemporary genetic edge distances, respectively. The Bayesian clustering analyses identified broad-scale patterns of genetic structure and closely aligned with the R-ST network. The F-ST network revealed substantial contemporary genetic differentiation, particularly in areas presenting contemporary anthropogenic disturbances and habitat fragmentation. In general, relatively lower genetic diversity and greater genetic differentiation were detected along the southern range limit, differing from areas in the northern parts of the distribution. Moreover, estimation of migration rates suggested a northward movement of animals away from the southern range limit.

Using movement data to inform protected area design and conserve mobile species,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Protected areas (PAs) are a cornerstone of modern conservation. For PM that are established to conserve mobile species, it is important to cover all the key areas regularly used by these species. However, zonation and boundaries of PM have often been established with limited knowledge of animal movements, leaving the effectiveness of some PM doubtful. We used radio tracking data to evaluate the extent to which two coastal PM in mainland China encompassed the full range of habitats used by migratory shorebirds during non-breeding seasons. The core zone (highest restriction on human activities) of the Yalu Jiang Estuary National Nature Reserve (Liaoning) incorporated only 22 +/- 6% (n = 34) of the diurnal home range (95% kernel density) of the endangered great knots Calidris tenuirostris. In contrast, the core zone of Chongming Dongtan (Shanghai) incorporated 73 +/- 24% (n = 25) of the home range of dunlins Calidris alpina. During high tide, great knots in Yalu Jiang mostly occurred in the experimental zone (least restriction on human activities) or sometimes outside the PA boundary altogether, where the birds could face substantial threats. By investigating satellite tracking records, consulting published literature, interviewing local experts and mapping habitat composition in different coastal PM in China, we found that wet artificial supratidal habitats were frequently used by migratory shorebirds but the coverage of these habitats in coastal PM was low. These PA boundaries and/or zonations should be revised to conserve mobile species more effectively.

Plausible pressures on small pelagic fish population changes in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea,MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES,,,,,,,,,,,,"Important changes have been observed in recent decades in small pelagic fish (SPF) populations of the NW Mediterranean Sea: declines in biomass and landings of European anchovy and sardine, and a geographical expansion of round sardinella. These changes have been linked to environmental factors directly influencing annual recruitment and growth. The role of climate change in affecting the composition of plankton has also been suggested to explain declines in SPF, while other causes could be the recovery of predators, competition with other pelagic organisms that prey on early life phases of SPF (i.e. gelatinous zooplankton), interspecific competition for food, or impacts from fisheries harvest. To test the role of these potential pressures, we developed qualitative mathematical models of a NW Mediterranean pelagic food web. We used analyses of sign directed graphs and Bayesian belief networks to compare alternative hypotheses about how SPF species may have responded to combinations of different pressures. Data documenting changes in SPF populations were used to test predicted directions of change from signed digraph models. An increase in sea surface temperature (SST) that had either a positive impact on round sardinella or on gelatinous zooplankton abundance was the pressure that alone provided the most plausible insights into observed changes. A combination of various pressures, including an increase in SST, an increase of exploitation and changes to zooplankton also delivered results matching current observations.

Species in mutualistic interactions are often highly sensitive to disturbances like fire events, but the degree and complexity of their responses are unclear. We use bipartite insect-flower interaction networks across a recently burned landscape to explore how plant-pollinator interaction networks respond to a recent major fire event at the landscape level, and where fire refuges were present. We also investigate the effectiveness of these refuges at different elevations (valley to hilltop) for the conservation of displaced flower-visiting insects during fire events. Then, we explore how the degree of specialization of flower-visiting insects changes across habitats with different levels of fire impact. We did this in natural areas in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GCFR) biodiversity hotspot, which is species rich in plants and pollinators. Bees and beetles were the most frequent pollinators in interactions, followed by wasps and flies. Highest interaction activity was in the fire refuges and least in burned areas. Interactions also tracked flower abundance, which was highest in fire refuges in the valley and lowest in burned areas. Interactions consisted mostly of specialized flower visitors, especially in refuge areas. The interaction network and species specialization were lowest in burned areas. However, species common to at least two fire classes showed no significant difference in species specialization. We conclude that flower-rich fire refuges sustain plant-pollinator interactions, especially those involving specialized species, in fire-disturbed landscape. This may be an important shelter for specialized pollinator species at the time that the burned landscape goes through regrowth and succession as part of ecosystem recovery process after a major fire event.",,,,,"Adedoja, Opeyemi/0000-0001-6163-3424",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,MAY,2019,9,10,,,,,5777,5786,,10.1002/ece3.5161,,,,,,,WOS:000470923500019,31160998,,,,,

Radar techniques are especially useful for investigating species which fly at high altitudes, in darkness, or which are too small for applying electronic tags. Here, we present an overview of radar applications in biological conservation and highlight its future possibilities. Depending on the type of radar, information can be gathered on local- to continental-scale movements of airborne organisms and their behaviour. Such data can quantify flyway usage, biomass and nutrient transport (bioflow), population sizes, dynamics and distributions, times and dimensions of movements, areas and times of mass emergence and swarming, habitat use and activity ranges. Radar also captures behavioural responses to anthropogenic disturbances, artificial light and man-made structures. Weather surveillance and other long-range radar networks allow spatially broad overviews of important stopover areas, songbird mass roosts and emergences from bat caves. Mobile radars, including repurposed marine radars and commercially dedicated 'bird radars', offer the ability to track and monitor the local movements of individuals or groups of flying animals. Harmonic radar techniques have been used for tracking short-range movements of insects and other small animals of conservation interest. However, a major challenge in aeroecology is determining the taxonomic identity of the targets, which often requires ancillary data obtained from other methods.

How are hay meadow dynamics affected by the environment excluding management? Location Central Apennines, Italy. Methods Vegetation was studied in 66 hay meadows by random plots, recording four groups of explanatory variables: management, soil, topography, and space. Using partial ordinations, the explanatory variables of the variation in floristic composition and plant traits were divided into sets. Then, to emphasize the relationship between purely environmental variables and vegetation, we considered only the partial ordination executed with soil and topographic variables using management and spatial data as covariables. Results The soil variables had the highest marginal explanatory power. Organic matter was the main driver of floristic composition, indicating a gradient associated also with soil moisture. The pure effect of spatial variables was very important, reflecting historical processes. On the contrary, management and topography variables sets were relatively weak predictors. Partial ordination showed that two topographic variables, slope and height above the plain, had an important weight in the hay meadow floristic assemblage, influencing soil fertility. Conclusions This analysis (a) confirms the determining function of soil fertility and moisture in driving plant species composition and traits; (b) focuses on the marginal power of current management when past traditional agro-pastoral activity undergoes changes in mode and intensity; (c) highlights the role of spatial variables and site history; and (d) improves knowledge about topographical factors as drivers of species composition.

Here we use an ecosystem network approach to assess the recovery pathway and potential recovery debts of a coral reef ecosystem, following a pulse disturbance. We show that although species abundance and biomass indicators recovered in a decade after the perturbation, the ecosystem as a whole presented a recovery debt. The ecosystem structure lost complexity (became food chain like) and lost about 29% of its overall cycling efficiency and 9% of its transfer efficiency. Although the ecosystem trophic network in the fore reef may have maintained its general functioning, the ecosystem network in the lagoon, not directly exposed to the disturbance, presented a stronger recovery debt. Our results give new insights on how ecosystem network approaches can help identify ecosystem impacts and recovery pathways.",,,,"Gascuel, Didier/C-1439-2011; Claudet, Joachim/C-6335-2008; Coll, Marta/A-9488-2012","Gascuel, Didier/0000-0001-5447-6977; Coll, Marta/0000-0001-6235-5868; Claudet, Joachim/0000-0001-6295-1061",,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,APR,2019,22,3,,,,,658,676,,10.1007/s10021-018-0294-5,,,,,,,WOS:000465453900014,,,,,,

We assess the focal or 'umbrella' value of the boreal population of woodland caribou for conservation of mammalian and avian richness (n = 432) in the boreal region of Canada by (i) evaluating co occurrence of caribou distribution with that of boreal mammals (n = 102), birds (n = 330), at-risk mammals (n = 11) and at-risk birds (n = 47); and (ii) conducting systematic conservation planning using MARXAN software to identify minimum representative and complementary reserve networks, comprised of planning units deemed large enough (10,000 km2) for persistence of terrestrial wildlife, both at the extent of boreal caribou distribution and the entire boreal region. While boreal caribou overlap with the range of 90% of boreal birds and mammals, area-efficient networks representative of boreal diversity focus on species-rich areas south of caribou distribution and other areas that contain relatively small-ranged species. A similar pattern occurs when the MARXAN analysis focused only on caribou distribution, i.e. representative networks are preferentially located on southern herd ranges. However, this situation differs markedly to include large areas within the distribution of caribou if anthropogenic footprint on the landscape is considered as a constraint on reserve design. Efforts to sustain boreal caribou offer considerable opportunities to conserve diversity of co-occurring mammals and birds, including areas of the relatively more disturbed caribou southern ranges that have irreplaceable value in an efficient and representative pan-boreal network of reserves. The high focal value of boreal caribou for animal diversity should be considered when making decisions and policy choices about how to best allocate conservation efforts across its extensive distribution.",,,,"Fortin, Daniel/ABG-3554-2020","Wiersma, Yolanda/0000-0003-4604-9240",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,APR,2019,232,,,,,,238,252,,10.1016/j.biocon.2019.01.026,,,,,,,WOS:000460992700025,,,,,,

Urbanization has a range of adverse effects on ecosystem functioning, including the disruption of plant dispersal processes across the landscape. Urban fragmentation can alter the distance and directionality of dispersal, leading to disrupted gene flow among populations. The dispersal processes of plants that rely on animal-mediated dispersal (zoochory) may be disproportionately affected by urbanization, as many animals avoid urban areas or restrict their movements within urban habitats. This could alter the efficiency of animal dispersal vectors and modify seed movements across urban habitats. While recent studies suggest that seed dispersal networks can be complex and dynamic even in highly managed green areas with relatively low biodiversity, zoochory in urban environments remains understudied. We synthesize the existing literature on zoochory in urban environments and place the findings in the context of ecosystem dynamics. We assess the ecological and evolutionary consequences for seed dispersal, following urbanization, by considering how zoochory is affected by specific features of urban environments. These include the complexity of habitats with varying continuity; high disturbance and intense management; a high proportion of alien species combined with low natural biodiversity; animal behavioral adjustments in different urban settings; and rapid evolutionary change due to urbanization. We conclude that (1) urbanization can disrupt and alter zoochory processes; and (2) successful zoochory can, in turn, alleviate or worsen the challenges to ecosystem dynamics originating from increased urbanization. The dynamic urban seed dispersal networks are emerging as useful models for the adaptability of seed dispersal communities. Their study can also shed light on eco-evolutionary processes under anthropogenic selective pressures, including species interactions. Finally, urban zoochory processes are critical to the functioning of urban ecosystems and as such, constitute an important ecosystem service with management implications. We propose directions for further research into urban zoochory processes to ensure the maintenance of ecosystem dynamics as urbanization continues.",,,,"Hamalainen, Anni/AAO-2881-2020; Gelmi-Candusso, Tiziana/O-6869-2019","Gelmi-Candusso, Tiziana/0000-0003-0990-5255",,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,MAR 5,2019,7,,,,,,,,41,10.3389/fevo.2019.00041,,,,,,,WOS:000467396400001,,,,,,

Projecting the population trajectory of endangered species using models requires conservation practitioners to evaluate how variations in life history parameters may change a population's viability. This is particularly important for species that occur as fragmented populations and whose densities are naturally low. Simulations may be used to identify conservation actions that have a higher likelihood of reducing a species' extinction risk. Aims. The aim was to apply population viability models to the northern quoll (Dasyurus hallucatus) under alternative scenarios. Methods. The current (baseline) northern quoll demographic trajectories were evaluated using field-collected data derived from monitoring programs. The impact of alternative scenarios of mortality (for example, due to increased predation by introduced predators) and population supplementation (either from populations elsewhere or from captive breeding) on the viability of a northern quoll population was then determined. Key results. Under current conditions, individual Pilbara populations of northern quoll are projected to persist for over 20 years. However, these populations are sensitive to extinction events. Population growth rate and local extinction risk were most sensitive to changes in juvenile mortality as low as 5% per annum. Increased mortality of the juvenile age cohort above current levels resulted in a projected decline in population size of 22-54%, with a moderate-to-high chance (20-96%) of local extinction within 20 years. Supplementing the population produced a moderate increase in quoll persistence over this time period. Conclusions. Populations of northern quolls in the Pilbara, and potentially elsewhere in their range, are highly sensitive to even small perturbations in juvenile mortality rates. The continued persistence of quoll populations in fragmented refuges is characteristic of a species that functions as a dynamic metapopulation in the face of high environmental perturbations. Implications. Increased juvenile mortality above current levels - for example through the spread of cane toads or invasion of feral cats - may have serious implications for the persistence of the current network of northern quoll populations and other mammals that exhibit population fragmentation in arid environments. Estimates of survival rates for the juvenile cohort of quolls would improve diagnosis of a species' population dynamics as well as inform practitioners of key life-history sensitivities.",,,,,"Moro, Dorian/0000-0003-1621-2676",,,,,,,,,,,,1035-3712,1448-5494,,,,MAR,2019,46,2,,,,,165,175,e0152520,10.1071/WR18010,,,,,,,WOS:000461897600008,,,,,,

The Great Dismal Swamp (GDS), located in Virginia and North Carolina, U.S.A., has been altered since colonial times, particularly by extensive ditch networks installed to lower water levels and facilitate timber harvests. Consequently, peat decomposition rates have accelerated, and red maple has become the dominant tree species, reducing the historical mosaic of bald cypress, Atlantic white-cedar, and pocosin stands. Recent repair and installation of water control structures aim to control drainage and, in doing so, enhance forest community composition and preserve peat depths. To help inform these actions, we established five transects of 15 plots each (75 plots total) along a hydrologic gradient where we measured continuous water levels and ecosystem attributes, including peat depths, microtopography, and forest composition and structure. We found significant differences among transects, with wetter sites having thicker peat, lower red maple importance, greater tree density, and higher overall stand richness. Plot-level analyses comported with these trends, clearly grouping plots by transects (via nonmetric multidimensional scaling) and resulting in significant correlations between specific hydrologic metrics and ecosystem attributes.

Retrospective analyses of species' responses to anthropogenic disturbances can inform such strategies. We developed a hierarchical framework to contrast environmental conditions underlying persistence versus extirpation of an imperilled stream fish, Candy Darter (Etheostoma osburni), over decades of changing land use. The decline of E. osburni may broadly represent the challenge of conserving sensitive freshwater species in intensively used upland environments. Location New River drainage, Appalachian Mountains, USA. Methods We surveyed fish and habitat in historically occupied sites to identify population refugia, and used multivariate and spatial analyses to address three questions: (a) what are the environmental correlates of refugia? (b) are the pathways by which land use impacts instream habitat constrained by catchment- and/or segment-scale features? and (c) are E. osburni distributional dynamics spatially structured and explained by fine sediment and warm stream temperatures? Results We confirmed a recently localized distribution similar to other upland species, marked by at least seven extirpations from streams throughout E. osburni's southern range. Catchment-scale features primarily constrained land use and finer-scale habitat, leading to either extirpations or population-supporting refugia defined by features at multiple scales. Refugium habitats contained cooler temperatures and less fine sediment. Rare mismatches between persistence and habitat suitability were explained by network location, suggesting unmeasured environmental gradients and/or dispersal contributed to distributional dynamics. Main conclusions We provided insight at multiple spatial scales into how aquatic species' distributions become fragmented and localized. Our results demonstrate that natural landscape heterogeneity imparts spatially variable resistance of sensitive species to intensive land uses. By recognizing the scale-specific features that buffer populations from extirpation, conservation strategies could be tailored to protect naturally occurring refugium habitats and focus restoration in systems where such habitats are broadly lacking.",,,,"Dunn, Corey/S-5485-2019","Dunn, Corey/0000-0002-7102-2165",,,,,,,,,,,,1366-9516,1472-4642,,,,MAR,2019,25,3,,,,,385,399,,10.1111/ddi.12866,,,,,,,WOS:000458429600005,,,,,,

Food web approaches have been advocated to link community composition with ecosystem functioning by describing the fluxes of energy among species or trophic groups. However, estimating such fluxes remain problematic because current methods become unmanageable as network complexity increases. We developed a generalization of previous indirect estimation methods assuming a steady-state system (Hunt et al., ); the model estimates energy fluxes in a top-down manner assuming system equilibrium; each node's losses (consumption and physiological) balances its consumptive gains. Jointly, we provide theoretical and practical guidelines to use the fluxweb R package (available on CRAN at https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/fluxweb/index.html). We also present how the framework can merge with the allometric theory of ecology (Brown, Gillooly, Allen, Savage, & West, ; to calculate fluxes based on easily obtainable organism-level data (i.e., body masses and species groups-e.g., plants, animals), opening its use to food webs of all complexities. Physiological losses (metabolic losses or losses due to death other than from predation within the food web) may be directly measured or estimated using allometric relationships based on the metabolic theory of ecology, and losses and gains due to predation are a function of ecological efficiencies that describe the proportion of energy that is used for biomass production. The primary output is a matrix of fluxes among the nodes of the food web. These fluxes can be used to describe the role of a species, a function of interest (e.g., predation; total fluxes to predators), multiple functions, or total energy flux (system throughflow or multitrophic functioning). Additionally, the package includes functions to calculate network stability based on the Jacobian matrix, providing insight into how resilient the network is to small perturbations at steady state. Overall, fluxweb provides a flexible set of functions that greatly increase the feasibility of implementing food web energetic approaches to more complex systems. As such, the package facilitates novel opportunities for mechanistically linking quantitative food webs and ecosystem functioning in real and dynamic natural landscapes.",,,,"Brose, Ulrich/AAT-7547-2020; Wang, Shaopeng/J-7091-2012; Barnes, Andrew/AAQ-9592-2020","Brose, Ulrich/0000-0001-9156-583X; Barnes, Andrew/0000-0002-6499-381X; Giling, Darren P./0000-0002-9843-4362; Rosenbaum, Benjamin/0000-0002-2815-0874; Lefcheck, Jonathan/0000-0002-8787-1786",,,,,,,,,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,,,FEB,2019,10,2,,,,,270,279,,10.1111/2041-210X.13109,,,,,,,WOS:000459020800010,,,,,,

Here, we investigated how spatial patterns in food-web structure are associated with environmental gradients in the Barents Sea, a highly productive shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean. We compared food webs from 25 subregions in the Barents Sea and examined spatial correlations among food-web metrics, and between metrics and spatial variability in seawater temperature, bottom depth and number of days with ice cover. Several food-web metrics were positively associated with seawater temperature: connectance, level of omnivory, clustering, cannibalism, and high variability in generalism, while other food-web metrics such as modularity and vulnerability were positively associated with sea ice and negatively with temperature. Food-web metrics positively associated with habitat heterogeneity were: number of species, link density, omnivory, path length, and trophic level. This finding suggests that habitat heterogeneity promotes food-web complexity in terms of number of species and link density. Our analyses reveal that spatial variation in food-web structure along the environmental gradients is partly related to species turnover. However, the higher interaction turnover compared to species turnover along these gradients indicates a consistent modification of food-web structure, implying that interacting species may co-vary in space.

Vulnerability is being applied in drought and climate change policy theory, by describing exposure and sensitivity factors, and adaptive capacity. In this paper we examine these vulnerability factors in central-western Queensland (CWQ), Australia, as a case study to test the idea that vulnerability and resilience must be considered together to build strong and enduring rangeland communities. The region's economy and employment are strongly coupled with rain-fed agriculture. Drought is a key risk to CWQ communities, with 13 extended droughts recorded since 1898. The region has been officially in drought since 2013 following well below-average rainfall, and remains in drought in 2019. The impact has led to reductions in town business turnover of 30-60%, loss of livelihoods and outmigration of 20%. Outmigration corresponds to the recent periods of drought. Social networks have been destabilised, highlighting that the cascading impacts of drought are complex, interrelated and affect the whole community. Regionally led responses have helped to re-build social cohesion, provide mental health support and stimulate economic activity and employment. These actions provide examples of a systemic, whole-of-community approach, that (1) captures place-based advantages; (2) enhances internal and external socioeconomic networks; (3) engages meaningfully through multi-level consultation; and (4) seeks to build sustained financial investment. A common theme of success is partnerships which provide external support for regionally-identified issues and solutions. There has been considerable investment of public, philanthropic and private funds in drought relief and infrastructure programs. This has occurred through a whole-of-community approach, and suggests a move towards policy which aims to build long-term regional resilience. CWQ has linked vulnerability and resilience by asking of both internally and externally led drought relief will this action build or undermine community resilience'.

Here, we use sequence data originally generated from killer whale Orcinus orca skin biopsies for population genomics, to characterize the skin microbiome and investigate how host social and geographical factors influence the microbial community composition. Having identified 845 microbial taxa from 2.4 million reads that did not map to the killer whale reference genome, we found that both ecotypic and geographical factors influence community composition of killer whale skin microbiomes. Furthermore, we uncovered key taxa that drive the microbiome community composition and showed that they are embedded in unique networks, one of which is tentatively linked to diatom presence and poor skin condition. Community composition differed between Antarctic killer whales with and without diatom coverage, suggesting that the previously reported episodic migrations of Antarctic killer whales to warmer waters associated with skin turnover may control the effects of potentially pathogenic bacteria such as Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi.

Calls for urgent conservation action have been prompted by the increasing pace of development and declines in biodiversity, including songbirds. To assist conservation decision making, we introduce a framework to facilitate selection of the highest priority areas for a given conservation objective. We varied six key decision points representing possible constraints or a priori conservation factors: (1) prioritization metric (species representation vs. diversity), (2) geographic stratification, (3) degree of anthropogenic disturbance, (4) species' conservation status, (5) species' ecological association, and (6) climate-change and uncertainty discounting. Using the Zonation conservation planning tool, we evaluated landbird conservation priorities across 128 scenarios for 63 passerine species based on current and projected future density predictions. We compared Zonation land rankings across scenarios with respect to consistency, efficiency (additive and proportional conservation value per unit area), and the relative contributions of each of the six factors of interest. We found large differences between solutions depending on constraints and conservation objectives, and relatively low conservation efficiency overall, with the largest gains in overall conservation value observed in areas ranging from 0.31-0.56 of the study region. This reflects the large range of conservation opportunities still present in the Canadian boreal region, and the widely dispersed nature of landbird distributions, which results in high substitutability among similar areas. However, we did find increasing consistency among solutions as multiple constraints were considered. In particular, stratifying solutions geographically resulted in more consistent priorities, although at the expense of efficiency. Other constraints, including climate change, disturbance- and uncertainty-discounting, and the selection and weighting of species, helped to further focus priorities. Although no single scenario can be viewed as prescriptive, we provide a roadmap for prioritizing boreal songbird conservation efforts across multiple conservation objectives.",,,,"Stralberg, Diana/W-9267-2019","Stralberg, Diana/0000-0003-4900-024X",,,,,,,,,,,,1712-6568,,,,,DEC,2018,13,2,,,,,,,12,10.5751/ACE-01303-130212,,,,,,,WOS:000457478800013,,,,,,

Likewise, the degree of resistance of the model-systems and the compartments most sensitive after perturbations were also evaluated. The biomass of the Rhodophyta group was the most abundant compartment in Isla Isabel National Park (IINP) and Islas Marietas National Park (IMNP), whilst the Phytoplankton group had the highest biomass in Sanctuary of Islands and Islets of Bahia Chamela (SIIBC). Based on the magnitudes of Total System Throughput (TST), Ascendency (A), Overhead (Ov), Capacity (C), Average Mutual Information (AMI), Finn's Cycling Index (FCI) and the Total Biomass/Total System Throughput (TB/TST) ratio, IINP was more mature, organised, developed and healthy than IMNP and SIIBC. Phytoplankton, Detritus and Zooplankton contributed >60% of the total Ascendency, whereas Jacks and Octopus sp. accounted for the complexity of the three MPA model systems. The outcomes of the propagated impacts, using Mixed Trophic Impacts (MTI) and short-term Ecosim simulations (under three levels of mortality: 10%, 30% and 50%), showed that the Groupers (i.e., exploited fish), Omnivorous Fish, Rhodophyta, Large Epifauna and Phytoplankton produced the highest impacts on the remaining compartments of the three model systems. The average System Recovery Time (SRT) suggested that SIIBC was less resilient to disturbances compared with IINP and IMNP. Based on the outcomes, we suggest that the marine zones adjacent to IINP should be included in the Mexican Management Program to create a buffer zone for these coral ecosystems. Likewise, IMNP and SIIBC should be candidates for a putative monitoring programme to assess the trajectory of the systemic health of coral ecosystems.

Three replicates of agricultural lands, grasslands and secondary forest habitats were sampled on a monthly basis for 12 months. The highest mean abundance of flower-visiting insects and flowering plants was observed in the secondary forest and the lowest record was found on agricultural lands. Furthermore, networks in secondary forests had a higher mean number of interactions, network size and nestedness compared to those observed in agricultural fields. Flower abundance was positively correlated with the number of interactions and network specialization. The significantly higher value of the qualitative and quantitative network indices in the secondary forests underscores the ecological importance of this land use type for conservation of insect-flower interactions in highly fragmented landscapes in the tropics such as the one studied here.

Effects of land cover change on species can be direct (when habitat is converted to alternative land cover types) or indirect (when land outside of the species habitat is altered). Hydrologic and ecological connections between terrestrial and aquatic systems are well understood, exemplifying how spatially disparate land cover conditions may influence aquatic habitats, but are rarely examined. We sought to quantify relative effects of land cover at two different but interacting scales on habitat suitability for the endangered arroyo toad (Anaxyrus californicus). Based on an existing distribution model for the arroyo toad and available land cover data, we estimated effects of land cover along streams and within entire watersheds on habitat suitability using structural equation modeling. Relationships between land cover and habitat suitability differed between scales, and broader, watershed-scale conditions influenced land cover along the embedded stream networks. We found anthropogenic development and forest cover at the watershed-scale negatively impacted habitat suitability, but development along stream networks was positively associated with suitability. The positive association between development along streams and habitat suitability may be attributable to increased spatial heterogeneity along urbanized streams, or related factors including policies designed to conserve riparian habitats amidst development. These findings show arroyo toad habitat is influenced by land cover across multiple scales, and can inform conservation of the species. Furthermore, our methodology can help elucidate similar dynamics with other taxa, particularly those reliant on both terrestrial and aquatic environments.",,,,"Kyle, Gerard T./O-9934-2019","Kyle, Gerard T./0000-0002-6944-9020; Treglia, Michael/0000-0001-5231-2223",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,DEC,2018,228,,,,,,310,318,,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.10.032,,,,,,,WOS:000452815200034,,,,,,

Studies of stream temperature responses to wildfire disturbance are often limited to individual watersheds or burn events, resulting in an incomplete understanding of: 1) how wildfires affect stream temperature at broader spatial scales and 2) which environmental and pyrological factors are important predictors of thermal responses. We analyzed long-term temperature monitoring data from 18 fire-affected streams across the Pacific Northwest We used a nonparametric effect-size approach to quantify response patterns among 26 metrics describing the thermal regime (magnitude, variability, frequency, and timing of thermal events) in the 1st postfire year. We used multivariate ordination and spatially explicit data on pyrological, hydrological, and meteorological conditions to identify potential drivers of thermal sensitivity to wildfire effects in disturbed watersheds. Thermal responses were highly variable at the site level, but, in general, streams of the Pacific Northwest are prone to increased frequency of warmer temperatures and decreased frequency of cooler temperatures in the year after a wildfire. Redundancy analysis showed that 30 to 55% of the variation in stream temperature responses was equally explained by pyrological, hydrological, and meteorological conditions. Mean annual precipitation, % watershed burned, and mean annual flow were primary factors shaping thermal response to wildfire, but the relative importance of these potential drivers varied among aspects of the thermal regime. Our study provides new insight into the regional influence of wildfire on stream thermal regimes and indicates that wildfire could exacerbate climate-induced warming in streams.

For example, smaller ponds are at greater risk in a drying climate and their loss would remove any obligate aquatic individuals present. We asked what proportional loss of species diversity from metacommunities comprised of discrete habitat patches should be expected from attrition (complete loss) of only the smallest patches under such a premise. We analyzed 175 published datasets for different taxonomic groups (vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants) and habitat types (islands, habitat islands, and fragments). We simulated the destruction of only the smallest patches to an approximate 20% of total area (range: 15.2%-24.2%) and analyzed species loss. Mean [+/- 95% CI] species loss was 12.7% [10.8, 14.6], although 18.3% of datasets lost no species. Four broad patterns of species loss were evident, reflecting underlying differences in minimum area requirements and the degree of species turnover among patches. Regression modeling showed species loss increased with greater species turnover among patches (beta(SIM)) and decreased with greater area scaling of diversity (i.e., larger power-law island species-area relationship exponents). Losses also increased with greater numbers of single-patch endemics and with increasing proportions of patches destroyed. After accounting for these predictors, neither taxonomic group nor habitat type increased explained variation in species loss. Attrition of the smallest patches removed species in >80% of metacommunities, despite all larger patches and >75% of total area remaining intact. At both 10% and 20% area reduction, median species loss across all datasets was around 50% higher than predicted from methods based on the species-area relationship. We conclude that any mechanism of global change that selectively destroys small habitat patches will lead to imminent extinctions in most discrete metacommunities.",,,,"Deane, DC/C-5854-2017","Deane, DC/0000-0003-2144-624X",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,DEC,2018,24,12,,,,,5802,5814,,10.1111/gcb.14452,,,,,,,WOS:000449650600017,30238565,,,,,

The conservation issues of Bialowieza Forest,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Loggings in biodiversity hot-spots are perceived as very serious threat to forest species and habitats of high conservation interest. In this paper we scrutinize the spatial impacts of recent loggings in the Polish part of the renowned Bialowieia Forest being the last remaining area of lowland temperate forest with a primeval character in Europe with the status of World Heritage and Natura 2000 site. The loggings have been applied in order to cope with the outbreak of the spruce bark beetle Ips typographus. We used satellite images to perform cover change detection analysis that delineated areas being logged in Bialowieia Forest between July 2015 and June 2018. Next, we assessed the extent of forest loss in areas with different management regimes as well as landscape-scale impacts. The total area of detected clear-cuts amounted to at least 675 ha, including 229 ha of old-growth stands. Assuming a buffer of 100 m from the edge of cleared forest patches, the cumulative direct and indirect impact of recent logging activities was estimated to amount to at least 4073 ha of affected forest. Logging activities resulted in a 26% increase in fragmentation in the entire Natura 2000 area. We argue that the ecological impact of logging extends beyond the logged areas by modifying the landscape structure and affecting ecosystem functioning on a landscape scale. As such, the recent salvage loggings in the Bialowieia Forest clearly damaged the conservation value of this precious area, not in the least by increasing its fragmentation. To avoid further degradation, we strongly argue for allowing natural tree regeneration on clear cuts and also for the extension of Bialowieia National Park to cover the entire forested area.",,,,"Churski, Marcin/Y-5361-2019","Churski, Marcin/0000-0001-8727-0203; Bubnicki, Jakub Witold/0000-0002-2064-3113; Czeszczewik, Dorota/0000-0003-0523-1417",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,NOV,2018,227,,,,,,266,274,,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.09.001,,,,,,,WOS:000449129700030,,,,,,

The diversity and structure of plant-animal interaction networks may change along elevational gradients and in response to human-induced habitat fragmentation. While previous studies have analyzed the effects of elevation and forest fragmentation on species interaction networks in isolation, to our knowledge no study has investigated whether the effects of forest fragmentation on species interactions may differ along elevational gradients. In this study, we analyzed main and interaction effects of elevation and forest fragmentation on plant-frugivore interaction networks at plant and bird species level. Over a period spanning two years, we recorded plant-frugivore interactions at three elevations (1000, 2000 and 3000 m a.s.l.) and in two habitat types (continuous and fragmented forest) in tropical montane forests in southern Ecuador. We found a consistent effect of elevation on the structure of plant-frugivore networks. We observed a decrease in the number of effective bird partners of plants and, thus, a decline in the redundancy of bird species with increasing elevation. Furthermore, bird specialization on specific plant partners increased towards high elevations. Fragmentation had a relatively weak effect on the interaction networks for both plant and bird species, but resulted in a significant increase in bird specialization in fragmented forests at high elevations. Our results indicate that forest fragmentation may have stronger effects on plant-frugivore interaction networks at high compared to low elevations because bird species richness declined more steeply towards high elevations than plant species richness. We conclude that conservation efforts should prioritize the maintenance of consumer diversity, for instance by maintaining stretches of continuous forest.

Understanding to what extent the temporal dynamics of interactions is determined by climate and disturbances is thus relevant to predict ecological and evolutionary outcomes in a changing world. Here, we assessed whether the temporal dynamics of ant-plant interactions in a mountainous fire-prone ecosystem is driven by seasonal variation in abiotic conditions, and to what extent fire disturbance alters this dynamic. We also examined the thermal responses of foliage-dwelling ants in order to predict the effects of seasonal oscillations of temperature on ant activity. To do so, we monitored ant-plant associations in 35 sampling plots for one year before an unmanaged fire has occurred. Then, 26 burned and nine unburned plots were monitored for another year after fire. We found that warmer and wetter conditions let to increases in the diversity and frequency of ant-plant interactions, mainly via upturns in plant resource availability and ant foraging activity. Beyond the positive effects of temperature on interaction networks, however, ant species exhibited a low heterogeneity and a huge overlap in thermal niches. Moreover, fire has led to short-term negative effects on the diversity and frequency of interactions in ant-plant networks. In spite of it, these network metrics in burned plots took up to half a year to return to similar levels from unburned plots, highlighting the resilience of ant-plant interactions after fire disturbances. This study shows that wide thermal niches of ant species and fire resilience likely beget ant-plant networks reliability over seasons. The high overlap and broad thermal niches of ant species interacting with plant resources suggest that ant diversity plays a minor role in the tolerance against climatic changes in this fire-adapted community. These findings open a new pathway to explore thermal responses of species and their ecological interactions in broader gradients of environmental conditions and ecosystem disturbances. We advocate that long-term studies comprising assisted burnings are desirable to forecast the impact of fire regimes and how their synergy with climate would affect the functioning of fire-prone ecosystems. Lastly, this study adds evidence that studied interaction networks can be useful to monitor the impacts of environmental changes such as anthropogenic disturbances, being representative of many even more complex species interactions in ecosystems.",,,,"Neves, Frederico/E-5777-2013; Bluthgen, Nico/F-5983-2010; Viana-Junior, Arleu/AAX-5097-2020","Neves, Frederico/0000-0002-2691-3743; Viana-Junior, Arleu/0000-0002-9964-9875",,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,OCT,2018,93,,,,,,247,255,,10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.05.001,,,,,,,WOS:000452692600026,,,,,,

Among various effects on wildlife, roads can disrupt the interaction between plants and their animal-mediated seed dispersers, compromising plant community composition and regeneration. Here, using the Chinese beech (Fagus engleriana) nut-rodent system, we quantified the extent to which rodent functions on seed dispersal were modified in habitats adjacent to roads. Compared to transects 200 m from the road, we observed approximately nine times greater seed dispersal effectiveness at transects 10 m proximity to the road and six times greater at 100 m from the road. Associated with this, high densities of seedlings, saplings and mature trees occurred closer to the road, suggesting that the road effect zone may facilitate plant recruitment. However, road proximity resulted in shorter nut dispersal distances, which did not support a benefit to plant recruitment. These counteractive effects may be caused by modified rodent behaviour in the vicinity of the road, and also by effects on rodent distribution and activity in relation to road-side habitat structure and environmental pressure. Crucially, no tagged seeds were dispersed across the road, implying that it imposed a barrier effect on animal-mediated seed dispersal and plant recruitment. We conclude that the ever-expanding effect of roads on zoochorous seed dispersal may ultimately cause profound changes in the structure of plant communities across diverse ecosystems, on a global scale.",,,,"Zhou, Youbing/S-6079-2019",,,,,,,,,,,,,1433-8319,,,,,OCT,2018,34,,,,,,102,108,,10.1016/j.ppees.2018.08.006,,,,,,,WOS:000447005400011,,,,,,

Initial mortality estimates for 2012 varied among tree genera. A rapid damage assessment (RDA) estimated that 65.5 (+/- 7.3) million trees died as a result of the drought in this region one year post-drought. However, this estimate was untested against established monitoring networks. Moreover, pests and physiological damage can elevate tree mortality multiple years beyond a drought event. Since the RDA was unable to quantify multi-year trends, it remained unclear whether these drivers caused increased tree mortality in east Texas beyond one year post-drought and how different species responded over time. To address these questions, we compared total 2012 standing dead tree (SDT) estimates (i.e., drought-killed plus all other SDT excluding harvested or salvaged trees) derived from the RDA and U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data for east Texas. Total SDT estimates did not significantly differ between the RDA (120.5 +/- 8.5 million) and FIA (108.4 +/- 8.7 million). Furthermore, total SDT estimates for the four most common genera (Pinus, Quercus, Liquidambar, Ulmus), which comprised over 80% of all species, did not significantly differ between the RDA and FIA. Additionally, we used logistic regression and FIA data from east Texas for 2011 through four years post-drought (2012-2015) to examine temporal trends in plot-level drought- and pest-driven tree mortality of seven key species (Pinus taeda, Pinus echinata, Quercus nigra, Quercus stellata, Quercus falcata, Liquidambar styraciflua, Ulmus alata) from the four most common genera. At the plot-level, drought-driven mortality was immediate for the three Quercus species (notably Q. falcata) and L. styraciflua which significantly increased in 2012 while P. taeda mortality was delayed, not increasing significantly until 2013. Pest-driven mortality increased from 2013 to 2015 for all species, with the highest mortality observed in Q. falcata and lowest in P. taeda and U. alata.

Nevertheless, the influence of climatic variation on the temporal dynamics of plant-herbivore networks has been scarcely studied. In this study we evaluated the influence of temperature and precipitation on the structure and selectiveness of plant-herbivore networks associated to a seasonal tropical ecosystem in the Gulf of Mexico. Although a significant turnover was observed in plant and herbivore species across seasons, high modularity and selectivity of the networks remained relatively constant despite the temporal variation in climatic variables. However, precipitation and temperature was negatively associated with niche overlap for herbivores and positively related to evenness of network interactions. In other words, less stressful conditions are likely to promote the diversification in the use of resources by herbivores, and increase evenness of interactions in the network. An increase in niche overlap and a decrease in the evenness of interactions during the driest and coldest months could be promoted by the presence of less specialized herbivores when availability and quality of host resources is lower. We suggest that the constancy in network selectiveness and modularity facilitates the coexistence of species through the fine distribution of niches and the equitable distribution of food resources in periods of greater precipitation and temperature, when the availability of host plants is greater.

We then extend our model to explore interaction betadiversity across two distinct seasons.

These results highlight the challenge of inferring the causes of interaction betadiversity when interaction detectability is low.

The associated immigration and extinction events are likely constrained by the spatial distribution of species. Still, studies on environmental change typically quantify biotic responses at single spatial (time series within a single plot) or temporal (spatial beta diversity at single time points) scales, ignoring their potential interdependence. Here, we use data from a global network of grassland experiments to determine how turnover responses to two major forms of environmental change - fertilisation and herbivore loss - are affected by species pool size and spatial compositional heterogeneity. Fertilisation led to higher rates of local extinction, whereas turnover in herbivore exclusion plots was driven by species replacement. Overall, sites with more spatially heterogeneous composition showed significantly higher rates of annual turnover, independent of species pool size and treatment.

Since the spatial and temporal distribution of animals and plants is unequal, their pairwise interactions are also expected to vary or rewire, generating dissimilarities among species interaction networks. In this study, we evaluated the structure of ant-plant interaction networks and described its dissimilarities by assessing species and the turnover of their interactions between day and night periods across two plant physiognomies in a semiarid Neotropical environment of central Mexico. We found that even though the emergent nested structure of networks remains invariant, the great majority of ant-plant interactions are reassembled in less than one day. Moreover, we observed that, between day-night periods, the interaction turnover was mainly driven by rewiring of interactions while, between plant physiognomies, this was generated by both interaction rewiring and species turnover. We postulate that interaction rewiring across the studied habitats could be influenced by the turnover of the central core of highly interacting species. Furthermore, we highlight that both interaction rewiring and species turnover shape ant-plant interactions turnover over day-night periods and plant physiognomies.",,,,"De la Torre, Pedro Luna/I-1223-2019; , WD/A-6371-2012","De la Torre, Pedro Luna/0000-0002-0047-6469; , WD/0000-0002-4758-4379",,,,,,,,,,,,0140-1963,1095-922X,,,,SEP,2018,156,,,,,,69,76,,10.1016/j.jaridenv.2018.04.003,,,,,,,WOS:000439682400009,,,,,,

Understanding the effects of trail and road networks on wildlife behavior is crucial to effective management for subsistence opportunities in communities that depend on accessible populations as an ecosystem service. We collared 26 adult male moose (Alces alces) in interior Alaska to monitor fine-scale habitat selection and movement patterns before, during, and after the hunting season in relation to trail and habitat characteristics. Moose response varied by region and the associated distribution of regional hunter trails (e.g., trails and secondary roads). Moose that resided in areas with extensive trail access selected habitat closer to trails and vegetative cover. Additionally, moose step length increased as distance to cover increased. Moose in more remote, less accessible regions avoided areas with high trail densities and selected habitat closer to quality forage during the hunting season. Moose step lengths also increased with higher densities of trails. Our research suggests that landscape-level hunter access can affect patterns of male moose movement and habitat selection to avoid risk during the hunting season.

A variety of movement models have been used for predicting the effects of natural or human-caused landscape changes, invading species, or other disturbances on local ecology. Here we introduce the flow network-a general modeling framework for population dynamics and movement in a metapopulation representing a network of habitat sites (nodes). Based on the principles of physical transport phenomena such as fluid flow through pipes (Pouiselle's Law) and analogously, the flow of electric current across a circuit (Ohm's Law), the flow network provides a novel way of modeling movement, where flow rates are functions of relative node pressures and the resistance to movement between them. Flow networks offer the flexibility of incorporating abiotic and biotic conditions that affect either pressures, resistance, or both. To illustrate an application of the flow network, we present a theoretical invasion scenario. We consider the effects of spatial structure on the speed of invasion by varying the spatial regularity of node arrangement. In the context of invasion, we model management actions targeting nodes or edges, and consider the effects on speed of invasion, node occupation, and total abundance. The flow network approach offers the flexibility to incorporate spatial heterogeneity in both rates of flow and site pressures and offers an intuitive approach to connecting population dynamics and landscape features to model movement.",,,,,"Taylor, Caz/0000-0002-8293-1014; Rael, Rosalyn/0000-0003-0172-4716",,,,,,,,,,,,1874-1738,1874-1746,,,,SEP,2018,11,3,,,,,271,280,,10.1007/s12080-018-0373-4,,,,,,,WOS:000442864500002,,,,,,

We then compared PA performance with a set of alternative priority areas for conservation, which consider fire-vegetation dynamics, selected by using a conservation planning tool (MARXAN).

The response to this change by ecosystems around the world is highly uncertain. To address this uncertainty, it is critical to understand the potential drivers and mechanisms of change in order to develop more reliable predictions. Australia's Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTERN) has brought together some of the longest running (10-60 years) continuous environmental monitoring programs in the southern hemisphere. Here, we compare climatic variables recorded at five LTERN plot network sites during their period of operation and place them into the context of long-term climatic trends. Then, using our unique Australian long- term datasets (total 117 survey years across four biomes), we synthesize results froma series of case studies to test two hypotheses: 1) extreme weather events for each plot network have increased over the last decade, and; 2) trends in biodiversity will be associated with recent climate change, either directly or indirectly through climate-mediated disturbance (wildfire) responses. We examined the biodiversity responses to environmental change for evidence of non-linear behavior. In line with hypothesis 1), an increase in extreme climate events occurred within the last decade for each plot network. For hypothesis 2), climate, wildfire, or both were correlated with biodiversity responses at each plot network, but there was no evidence of non-linear change. However, the influence of climate or fire was context-specific. Biodiversity responded to recent climate change either directly or indirectly as a consequence of changes in fire regimes or climate-mediated fire responses. A national long-term monitoring framework allowed us to find contrasting species abundance or community responses to climate and disturbance across four of the major biomes of Australia, highlighting the need to establish and resource long-term monitoring programs across representative ecosystem types, which are likely to show context-specific responses.

Large spatial and temporal scales of dynamics, and the lack of frameworks linking observations to models, are challenges to understanding and predicting ecosystem responses to perturbations. The naturally-occurring microecosystem inside leaves of the northern pitcher plant (Sarraceniapurpurea) exhibits oligotrophic and eutrophic states that can be induced by adding insect prey. Here, we further develop a model for simulating these dynamics, parameterize it using data from a prey addition experiment and conduct a sensitivity analysis to identify critical zones within the parameter space. Simulations illustrate that the microecosystem model displays regime shifts and hysteresis. Parallel results were observed in the plant itself after experimental enrichment with prey. Decomposition rate of prey was the main driver of system dynamics, including the time the system remains in an anoxic state and the rate of return to an oxygenated state. Biological oxygen demand influenced the shape of the system's return trajectory. The combination of simulated results, sensitivity analysis and use of empirical results to parameterize the model more precisely demonstrates that the Sarracenia microecosystem model displays behaviors qualitatively similar to models of larger ecological systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0304-3800,1872-7026,,,,AUG 24,2018,382,,,,,,1,8,,10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2018.04.016,,,,,,,WOS:000434903600001,,,,,,

Aquatic environment can be extremely stressful to its inhabitants because most of them are poikilothermous. In the present study, attempt was made to evaluate the biological effects of oxidative-stress and adaptive/antioxidant capacities during temperature variations (36-40 degrees C for 24hrs to 72hrs) in Bellamya bengalensis both in environmental and laboratory conditions by testing some biomarkers like HSP70, catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione reductase (GR). The biomarker potency of the molecules and the anti-oxidative metabolic network was postulated and extrapolated to find its resemblance to the climate-change associated organismal variations. In a natural and eco-restored environment in the Eastern part of India, 10-20 fold increases in CAT, SOD and HSP70 protein expressions (Western blot results) were noticed in Bellamya paralleling to their increased enzymatic activities (gel zymogram studies) due to the seasonal (summer versus winter) temperature variation. It is evident from the consecutive three years' study that this variation resulted in the unfavorable physicochemical changes of water quality parameters like dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, alkalinity and consequently decreased the animal density in summer. And that was revived due to their higher reproduction rate in post rainy/winter season when temperature normalizes resulting in a restoration of favorable environment. In laboratory condition, the reduced GR and increased GPx indicated the oxidative damage as evident by higher tissue MDA level following to higher mortality. Changes in SOD and CAT activities suggest activation of physiological mechanism to scavenge the ROS produced during heat stress. However, when mortality increased at different time points (36 degrees C - 72h and 38 degrees C - 72 h), these enzyme activities also decreased as they failed to save the tissues from ROS. The results suggest that temperature variation does alter the active oxygen metabolism by modulating antioxidant enzyme activities, which can be used as biomarker to detect sub-lethal effects of climate change-associated pollution. The parity in environmental and laboratory experimental results may justify this laboratory experiment as model heat-stress experiment and indicate temperature as a universal stressor which alone or in combination with other water parameters initiates a consistent adapting behavior.

The Alaskan Matanuska- Susitna Basin ( MSB) provides habitat for all five Pacific salmon species, and their large seasonal spawning runs are important both ecologically and economically. However, the encroachment of human development through urbanization and extractive industries poses a serious risk to salmon habitat in the MSB. 2. Using systematic conservation planning techniques, different methods of incorporating anthropogenic risks were assessed to determine how to conserve salmon habitat in the area cost- effectively. 3. The consequences of four distinct conservation scenarios were quantified: no consideration either of urbanization or extractive industries (` Risk ignored' scenario); accounting for the risk of urbanization, and avoiding conservation in all areas rich in fossil fuels (` Urbanization accounted, all extraction avoided' scenario); accounting for urbanization and oil and gas development, but avoiding conservation in coalrich areas (` Urbanization accounted, coal areas avoided' scenario); and accounting for all anthropogenic risks to habitat, and allowing conservation in oil, gas, or coal- rich areas (` All risks accounted' scenario). To compare conservation success and resilience, the impacts of these risks were estimated using Monte Carlo simulations. The final cost of each solution was then divided by the number of conservation targets met to determine a return on investment. 4. Results from scenarios that avoided all extractive activities, or only coal, suggest that conservation targets cannot be met simply by avoiding areas rich in fossil fuels, and these scenarios resulted in lower returns on investment than those in which risks from extraction were incorporated into the solution. 5.

Terrestrial mixed-species bird flocks (hereafter, TMSF) represent one such potential system: they form throughout the world, and in most cases have an asymmetric organization in which one or a few species play 'nuclear' roles, being particularly important for flock formation or maintenance. A quantitative study on the distribution of TMSF and how they respond to anthropogenic disturbance (AD) is still, however, needed. We surveyed 201 publications on terrestrial TMSF worldwide, finding that 19% of the world's bird species participate in them, including 158 threatened species, with tropical species dominating these lists. Of 31 TMSF studies that investigated AD, 22 showed significant declines in some metric, with TMSF in more impacted areas including 1/4 fewer species, and 1/3 fewer individuals. In 13/15 studies, TMSF were more sensitive to AD than the overall bird community. We conceptualize the reasons behind this response: first, AD directly influences drivers of flocking (predation, foraging), and second, AD produces changes in community composition that affect TMSF, such as when the extirpation or reduction of nuclear species affects other species' participation. We rank nuclear species globally by their consistency of leadership and number of followers, suggesting that these species' interactive roles be considered as part of their conservation value, and further that conserving TMSF provides an efficient mechanism to ensure the protection of many species simultaneously.",,,,"Goodale, Eben/AAM-7436-2020; Sieving, Kathyrn E/I-6058-2013","Goodale, Eben/0000-0003-3403-2847; Sieving, Kathyrn E/0000-0002-0849-8101; Jones, Harrison/0000-0003-1402-4778",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,AUG,2018,224,,,,,,267,276,,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.06.004,,,,,,,WOS:000439537600031,,,,,,

We employ a network approach to map the global trade routes of lobster (Homarus spp.) from small-scale producers in North America to terminal markets and evaluate the extent to which intermediary nations act to obscure producer-market relationships. In taking this approach, we provide a method for systematically measuring teleconnectivity created through seafood trade routes, and thus making explicit vulnerabilities to small-scale fisheries from this teleconnectivity. Our empirical analysis shows that the perceived trade diversification of lobster producers is masking increased dependencies on a reduced number of end-markets, particularly in Asia. These results suggest, paradoxically, that the apparent diversification of trade partnerships may actually amplify, rather than reduce, the vulnerabilities of small-scale fishers associated with international trade by making risk harder to identify and anticipate. We discuss our results in the context of local fisheries and global seafood trade and describe key impediments to being able to monitor market dependencies and exposure to potential vulnerabilities.",,,,"Fabinyi, Michael/G-5198-2012","Fabinyi, Michael/0000-0001-5293-4081",,,,,,,,,,,,,2296-7745,,,,JUL 10,2018,5,,,,,,,,239,10.3389/fmars.2018.00239,,,,,,,WOS:000457177000001,,,,,,

New techniques for measuring associations, in particular social networks and null simulations, have been applied to mixed-species group analyses. Unanswered questions include: (1) How do these methods compare to each other and to the traditional frequency table approach? (2) How similar are associations for the same pair of species in different habitats, such those with different disturbance histories or at different altitudes? (3) What traits of species influence these association strengths? Using data from an intensive study of mixed-species bird flocks in Sri Lanka, we used Mantel tests to compare associations calculated through three methods: the phi coefficient, social networks, and null simulations. Results from the three methods varied (0.53 < r < 0.75), but converged when out-of-flock data were added to the phi coefficient and social network methods (0.75 < r < 0.94). Correlations between the associations in different habitats were uniformly low (all <0.50) across all methods. These results, when combined with the fact that only a small percentage of the associations were statistically significant (9-14%, depending on the method used), suggest that on average, birds may not have strong preferences for other species in flocks. The trait analysis, conducted using the Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure found that species that are more similar to each other in their body mass and diet had higher association strengths. This result was similar to what has been found before in global meta-analyses; however, contrary to earlier reports, in this study association strength increased with increasing phylogenetic distance. The strength of these results decreased when non-statistically significant species associations were included in these analyses or out-of-flock data were excluded, again emphasizing that the method of calculating species associations can influence conclusions.

However, there is limited information on the extent to which populations are connected or how multiple disturbances affect connectivity, especially in coastal and marine ecosystems. We used network analysis and the outputs of a biophysical model to measure potential functional connectivity and predict the impact of multiple disturbances on seagrasses in the central Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area (GBRWHA), Australia. The seagrass networks were densely connected, indicating that seagrasses are resilient to the random loss of meadows. Our analysis identified discrete meadows that are important sources of seagrass propagules and that serve as stepping stones connecting various different parts of the network. Several of these meadows were close to urban areas or ports and likely to be at risk from coastal development. Deep water meadows were highly connected to coastal meadows and may function as a refuge, but only for non-foundation species. We evaluated changes to the structure and functioning of the seagrass networks when one or more discrete meadows were removed due to multiple disturbance events. The scale of disturbance required to disconnect the seagrass networks into two or more components was on average >245km, about half the length of the metapopulation. The densely connected seagrass meadows of the central GBRWHA are not limited by the supply of propagules; therefore, management should focus on improving environmental conditions that support natural seagrass recruitment and recovery processes.

Anthropogenic disturbance and climate change might negatively affect the ecosystem services provided by mutualistic networks. However, the effects of such forces remain poorly characterized. They may be especially important in dry forests, which (1) experience chronic anthropogenic disturbances (CADs) as human populations exploit forest resources, and (2) are predicted to face a 22% decline in rainfall under climate change. 2. In this study, we investigated the separate and combined effects of CADs and rainfall levels on the specialization of mutualistic networks in the Caatinga, a seasonally dry tropical forest typical of north-eastern Brazil. More specifically, we examined interactions between plants bearing extrafloral nectaries (EFNs) and ants. We analysed whether differences in network specialization could arise from environmentally mediated variation in the species composition, namely via the replacement of specialist by generalist species. 3. We characterized these ant-plant networks in 15 plots (20x20m) that varied in CAD intensity and mean annual rainfall. We quantified CAD intensity by calculating three indices related to the main sources of disturbance in the Caatinga: livestock grazing (LG), wood extraction (WE) and miscellaneous resource use (MU). We determined the degree of ant-plant network specialization using four metrics: generality, vulnerability, interaction evenness and H-2'. 4. Our results indicate that CADs differentially influenced network specialization: we observed positive, negative, and neutral responses along LG, MU and WE gradients, respectively. The pattern was most pronounced with LG. Rainfall also shaped network specialization, markedly increasing it. While LG and rainfall were associated with changes in network species composition, this trend was not related to the degree of species specialization. This result suggests that shifts in network specialization might be related to changes in species behaviour, not species composition. 5. Our study highlights the vulnerability of such dry forest ant-plant networks to climate change. Moreover, dry forests experience highly heterogeneous anthropogenic disturbances, creating a geographic mosaic of selective forces that may shape the co-evolution of interactions between ants and EFN-bearing plants.",,,,"Camara, Talita/AAV-1635-2020; Arnan, Xavier/N-7829-2013; Bluthgen, Nico/F-5983-2010; ramon, anna/O-1249-2019; Leal, Inara R./E-8362-2010","Arnan, Xavier/0000-0002-9904-274X; Leal, Inara R./0000-0002-8125-2191; Camara, Talita/0000-0003-2793-8907",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JUL,2018,87,4,,,SI,,1022,1033,,10.1111/1365-2656.12820,,,,,,,WOS:000435940700011,29504629,,,,,

LocationTanimbar archipelago represents a group of islands south of the Banda sea in the Moluccas. The largest is the flat Yamdena (7 degrees 36S, 131 degrees 25E). MethodsVegetation was interpreted from LANDSAT satellite data, overlaid with geology and topography for pre-stratification. Within each strata, forest sites were equally systematically sampled using a network of small 0.2ha survey plots (60 plots, 7,130 trees) and soil pits sampled for 44 of the vegetation plots. Fisher's alpha diversity index was used together with ordination techniques to assert differences in forest types. ResultsThe forest covered c. 70% of the island, comprising seasonal evergreen forest (SEF), dry deciduous forest (DDF) and moist deciduous forest' (MDF). The SEF canopy (Burseraceae, Meliaceae, Oleaceae and Dilleniaceae) sited around 35m. The density of trees above 10cm diameter averaged 632 individuals/ha, the basal area (BA) was 32m(2)/ha, and species diversity (SD, Fischer ) 14.84. Rattans are abundant in the understorey. The MDF exhibited a mixture of evergreen and deciduous big trees while the lower storey was evergreen. Rattans were less common. Distinct family species associations emerged from the ordination (Combretaceae, Fabaceae, Malvaceae and Apocynaceae or Meliaceae, Gnetaceae, Clusiaceae). The density of trees averaged 491 individuals/ha, BA 26m(2)/ha and SD 18.73. The canopy of the DDF (Ebenaceae, Fabaceae, Apocynaceae and Menispermaceae) was around 30m. During the dry season all tree species shed their leaves. The density of trees averaged 552 individuals/ha, BA 20m(2)/ha and SD 11.58. ConclusionsThe last natural seasonal forests of Indonesia are nowadays only found in the Tanimbar Archipelago. The existence of three contrasted seasonal forest types on small flat island was remarkable and should be quickly translated into decision making for land zoning, agriculture or forestry development, avoiding approaches applied in the humid region of the country. To succeed however, the ecology of these seasonal forests should quickly become priority areas for research to feed the design of suitable conservation and management strategies.",,,,"Nasi, Robert/P-2382-2019","Nasi, Robert/0000-0001-9739-3135",,,,,,,,,,,,1402-2001,1654-109X,,,,JUL,2018,21,3,,,,,461,476,,10.1111/avsc.12377,,,,,,,WOS:000442660900011,,,,,,

Non-trophic interactions (or, inter-species associations) play a prominent role in determining community structure and function. Mixed-species bird flocks are networks of non-trophic associations that confer foraging and anti-predator benefits to participant species. Yet, the responses of these interspecific associations to anthropogenic environmental changes are poorly understood. 2. Selective logging is pervasive in the tropics, and can affect associations in mixed-species bird flocks by altering resource availability and/or predation risk, or through the altered abundances of species participating in mixed flocks. Across a gradient of logging intensity, we examined how the number and strength of associations in two different mixed-species flock types responded to logging intensity, while simultaneously controlling statistically for changes in the abundances of species in response to logging. 3. Across the logging gradient, we used network analyses to: (1) quantify the proportion of potentially realizable associations, and (2) measure the strengths of these realized associations. For both these analyses, we used null models to investigate whether changes in the network properties of mixed flocks were simply abundance-driven, or congruent with expectations of how flock properties might be modified by selective logging. 4. In understorey flocks, after controlling statistically for changing abundances of participant species, the proportion of realized associations decreased with increasing logging intensity, whereas mean association strength did not show any relation with logging intensity. In midstorey flocks, both the proportion and mean strength of realized associations increased with increasing logging intensity. 5. Synthesis and applications. By statistically separating abundance and behaviour-mediated effects, we show that interspecific associations in mixed-species bird flocks respond to potential resource and/or predation changes from logging, but that their functional roles persist in logged forest. We show that logged forests can conserve not only community richness, but also function. Thus, these logged forests must be prevented from ongoing conversion into non-forest habitats such as agriculture and plantation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,JUL,2018,55,4,,,,,1637,1646,,10.1111/1365-2664.13097,,,,,,,WOS:000434970200008,,,,,,

Land-use planners and managers are often responsible for providing access to natural areas for recreation while avoiding environmental impacts such as declines of threatened species. Since recreation can have harmful effects on biodiversity, reliable information about protected-area visitation patterns is vital for managers. Our goal was to quantify recreational use in a fragmented urban reserve network and identify factors that influenced visitation. We empirically measured visitation rates at 18 reserves in San Diego County, California. Using random forest models, we identified biophysical and socioeconomic factors that influenced spatial variation in visitation rates and made projections to 27 additional reserves, validating with an expert opinion survey. Visitation rates varied widely across the reserve network. Accessibility variables, such as numbers of housing units and parking lots, were key explanatory variables that had positive relationships with visitation rates. To illustrate the applications of our models, we assessed the exposure of 7 species and subspecies of conservation concern to recreation by comparing predicted occurrence to projected visitation intensities. We found that several species and subspecies, including the orange-throated whiptail (Aspidoscelis hyperythra), western spadefoot (Spea hcunmondii), and the federally-threatened coastal California gnatcatcher (Polioptila californica californica), are likely exposed to high levels of recreational activity.

We show that intensive water use (persistent, early season, rapid lake-level drawdown) can compress trophic diversity by 46%, necessitating reorganization of biostructural elements configuring lake food webs. Compression occurred over the delta C-13 axis indicating erosion of basal trophic diversity, but food chain length remained intact over the period and intensity of disturbance examined. This study demonstrates the potential for water use, like other disturbances (warming, eutrophication, and invasive species), to mute opportunity for benthic-pelagic coupling and benefits to lake food webs and the inherent capacity of lake ecosystems to adapt to stress.

Current reviews of threats to mixed flocks have only examined two types of anthropogenic pressures: different land use intensity and fragmentation. We highlight the bird trade as another major potential threat for many mixed species flocking species in Southeast Asia. We examine the potential indirect impact of the bird trade by comparing social networks of flocking data collected over two periods nearly 20 years apart (1997 and 2016) from the same site in Sumatra, Indonesia. We find that the structure of the two networks was significantly correlated. However, of the 90 species observed, 49 had previously been identified as part of the bird trade. These species experienced a significantly greater decrease in network centrality over time compared to the non-traded species, resulting in a loss of structure in the mixed-species flocking network. Simulating further disturbances suggests that flocks may not be resilient to the complete loss of two or more traded species. Our results suggest that trapping is likely to be contributing to the degradation of flocks, and ultimately could lead to the widespread declines in those other species that also rely on mixed-species flocking.",,,,"Farine, Damien R./Y-2454-2019","Farine, Damien R./0000-0003-2208-7613",,,,,,,,,,,,0006-3207,1873-2917,,,,JUN,2018,222,,,,,,222,231,,10.1016/j.biocon.2018.04.015,,,,,,,WOS:000434745900023,,,,,,

However, little work has been conducted in flammable ecosystems where spatially and temporally dynamic fire edges are expected to influence important processes such as recolonization of burnt areas and landscape connectivity. We review the literature on fire, fauna, and edge effects to summarize current knowledge of faunal responses to fire edges and identify knowledge gaps. We then develop a conceptual model to predict faunal responses to fire edges and present an agenda for future research. Faunal abundance at fire edges changes over time, but patterns depend on species traits and resource availability. Responses are also influenced by edge architecture (e.g., size and shape), site and landscape context, and spatial scale. However, data are limited and the influence of fire edges on both local abundance and regional distributions of fauna is largely unknown. In our conceptual model, biophysical properties interact with the fire regime (e.g., patchiness, frequency) to influence edge architecture. Edge architecture and species traits influence edge permeability, which is linked to important processes such as movement, resource selection, and species interactions. Predicting the effect of fire edges on fauna is challenging, but important for biodiversity conservation in flammable landscapes. Our conceptual model combines several drivers of faunal fire responses (biophysical properties, regime attributes, species traits) and will therefore lead to improved predictions. Future research is needed to understand fire as an agent of edge creation; the spatio-temporal flux of fire edges across landscapes; and the effect of fire edges on faunal movement, resource selection, and biotic interactions.

We compare the response of two different organism groups (fish and invertebrates) and ecological traits (fish guilds and invertebrate traits) to putative stress gradients, using northern Portuguese rivers as a case study. The rivers covered a quality gradient ranging from reference conditions to high levels of disturbance across classes of ecological status within designated Water Framework Directive monitoring networks. We tested three hypotheses: 1) Ecological traits respond better to regional level human impacts (e.g. land use), while taxa better respond to local factors (e.g. habitat changes or water quality); 2) Invertebrate traits or fish guilds respond to a wider range of anthropogenic disturbances compared to taxa and are not as strongly affected by temporal variation; 3) these two communities respond differently along the studied gradients. We used canonical correspondence analyses, including partial correspondence analysis and principal response curves to analyze change in composition and metrics and the relative contribution of environmental variables for each biological data set. We carried out analyses between sites and along a temporal gradient, complemented by linkage trees and logistic regressions. Conclusions are more complex than the formulated hypotheses. Although both invertebrate and fish communities revealed a similar ability to assess impairment, invertebrates responded more strongly to local disturbances, whereas the fish composition or traits/guilds were more sensitive to larger scale variation. Results for temporal variation analyses suggested that invertebrate traits more accurately detected change in environmental factors but variation in the taxonomic composition of fish species also followed a temporal gradient.

Individual differences in contact rate can arise from host, group and landscape heterogeneity and can result in different patterns of spatial spread for diseases in wildlife populations with concomitant implications for disease control in wildlife of conservation concern, livestock and humans. While dynamic disease models can provide a better understanding of the drivers of spatial spread, the effects of landscape heterogeneity have only been modelled in a few well-studied wildlife systems such as rabies and bovine tuberculosis. Such spatial models tend to be either purely theoretical with intrinsic limiting assumptions or individual-based models that are often highly species- and system-specific, limiting the breadth of their utility. 2. Our goal was to review studies that have utilized dynamic, spatial models to answer questions about pathogen transmission in wildlife and identify key gaps in the literature. We begin by providing an overview of the main types of dynamic, spatial models (e.g., metapopulation, network, lattice, cellular automata, individual-based and continuous-space) and their relation to each other. We investigate different types of ecological questions that these models have been used to explore: pathogen invasion dynamics and range expansion, spatial heterogeneity and pathogen persistence, the implications of management and intervention strategies and the role of evolution in host-pathogen dynamics. 3. We reviewed 168 studies that consider pathogen transmission in free-ranging wildlife and classify them by the model type employed, the focal host-pathogen system, and their overall research themes and motivation.

A large-scale assessment of local, riparian and catchment-scale influences on Amazonian fish",JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Agricultural expansion and intensification are major threats to tropical biodiversity. In addition to the direct removal of native vegetation, agricultural expansion often elicits other human-induced disturbances, many of which are poorly addressed by existing environmental legislation and conservation programmes. This is particularly true for tropical freshwater systems, where there is considerable uncertainty about whether a legislative focus on protecting riparian vegetation is sufficient to conserve stream fauna. 2. To assess the extent to which stream fish are being effectively conserved in agricultural landscapes, we examined the spatial distribution of assemblages in river basins to identify the relative importance of human impacts at instream, riparian and catchment scales, in shaping observed patterns. We used an extensive dataset on the ecological condition of 83 low-order streams distributed in three river basins in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. 3. We collected and identified 24,420 individual fish from 134 species. Multiplicative diversity partitioning revealed high levels of compositional dissimilarity (DS) among stream sites (DS = 0.74 to 0.83) and river basins (DS = 0.82), due mainly to turnover (77.8% to 81.8%) rather than nestedness. The highly heterogeneous fish faunas in small Amazonian streams underscore the vital importance of enacting measures to protect forests on private lands outside of public protected areas. 4. Instream habitat features explained more variability in fish assemblages (15%-19%) than riparian (2%-12%), catchment (4%-13%) or natural covariates (4%-11%). Although grouping species into functional guilds allowed us to explain up to 31% of their abundance (i.e. for nektonic herbivores), individual riparian - and catchment- scale predictor variables that are commonly a focus of environmental legislation explained very little of the observed variation (partial R-2 values mostly <5%). 5.

Current rates of agricultural intensification and mechanization in tropical landscapes are unprecedented, yet the existing legislative frameworks focusing on protecting riparian vegetation seem insufficient to conserve stream environments and their fish assemblages.

In this paper, we review how land-use changes affect wild native pollinator insects, as well as the particular effects of the three main types of land-use (agriculture, livestock grazing and urbanization) on pollinator abundance and diversity, plant-pollinator networks, and pollination service. Land-use changes may vary in intensity, but all of them involve habitat disturbances affecting pollinator populations, especially through modification of their floral and nesting resources. In general, regardless of the land-use type, changes whose intensity increases the availability of resources and the heterogeneity of microhabitats tend to have positive effects on the abundance and diversity of pollinators, whereas changes that reduce resource availability usually have negative effects. Moreover, the response of pollinators depends on their specific traits (specialization, mobility, sociability, nesting site, phenology). Some species or groups may be favoured while others disadvantaged by different land-uses.

The study of the structure and dynamics of pollination networks can give us information on species conservation and on the importance of pollination as an ecosystem service. In this work we analyzed the pollination networks of hymenoptera in two coastal localities of the island of Mallorca, one of them affected by habitat loss. A set of parameters was obtained describing the structure of interaction networks at both community and species level. In addition, we evaluated the species richness, diversity, and conservation status of hymenopterans presumably with greater functional relevance in each community (the most general and least selective). Both communities showed low connectance, a relatively high specialization and a low niche overlap, which suggests a high fragility to disturbances. In fact, the loss of habitat caused a decrease in the richness of plant species that resulted in a lower diversity of hymenopterans and plant-pollinator interactions. The community affected by the perturbation showed to be less robust to future disturbances than the unaltered community. The analyzed parameters allowed assessing the ecological role of the most important bees and wasps in the community and their behaviour at the temporal scale.

Movement is a key process driving animal distributions within heterogeneous landscapes. Graph (network) theory is increasingly used to understand and predict landscape functional connectivity, as network properties can provide crucial information regarding the resilience of a system to landscape disturbances, e.g. removal of habitat patches. The temporal dimension of movement patterns, however, is not generally included in network analysis, which can lead to a discrepancy between observed space use and landscape connectivity. Reaction-advection-diffusion models, when coupled with network analysis, could provide a powerful mechanistic framework based upon spatio-temporal dimensions of animal movement, but this approach remains poorly developed for ecological studies. 2. We developed a mechanistic space use model that considers both residency time in resource patches and movement amongst those patches within a spatial network. The framework involves two main steps: first, the network topology that best reflects functional connectivity for the study system is identified; second, a spatio-temporal flow dynamic is implemented within the network using reaction-advection-diffusion modelling. To illustrate the approach, we used observations of radiocollared plains bison Bison bison bison that were travelling in a meadow network within a forest matrix. 3. In the model application, we found that the graph best reflecting the functional connectivity of bison was a complex graph of ultra-small world scale-free network type. The reaction-advection-diffusion model involved the effect of meadow area and inter-meadow distance on bison travels. Simulations showed that a simple graph or distance-based graphs provided less accurate predictions of bison distribution, while also predicting different management actions to effectively impact bison space use. 4. Our study demonstrates how reaction-advection-diffusion modelling, coupled with network theory, can provide a robust mechanistic framework for predicting animal distribution in dynamic environments. The modelling approach can be applied to a large range of systems that are subjected to rapid environmental changes due to habitat management or natural resource extraction, for example. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that management and conservation planning can strongly depend upon network structure, and that a faulty assessment of network topology can result in poor planning, with potential unexpected impacts on animal distributions.",,,,"Fortin, Daniel/ABG-3554-2020; Rivest, Louis-Paul/AAU-9879-2020","Rivest, Louis-Paul/0000-0003-4351-4127; Duchesne, Thierry/0000-0001-9893-604X",,,,,,,,,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,,,MAY,2018,9,5,,,,,1221,1231,,10.1111/2041-210X.12997,,,,,,,WOS:000431666300007,,,,,,

Food web stability is hypothesized to be affected by disturbance and the nature of the energy pathways (i.e. allochthonous or autochthonous) of a community. In this study, we investigated whether food webs at paired sites, one in forest and the other in grassland, in ten New Zealand streams along a disturbance gradient differ in their topological structure and robustness. Food web robustness (an indicator of web resistance) assesses the ease with which secondary extinctions permeate the food web following an initial random extinction (disturbance). We found that neither the nature of the energy source nor physical disturbance affected structural metrics or web robustness.

For fisheries, strategies maintain or restore natural flow regimes and thermal conditions, improve water conservation, decrease fragmentation of stream networks, and develop geospatial data on stream temperature and geologic hazards.

We explore how eco-evolutionary feedbacks influence trait evolution and species abundances in 23 empirical antagonistic networks. We show that, if selection due to antagonistic interactions is stronger than other selective pressures, ecoevolutionary feedbacks lead to higher mean species abundances and lower temporal variation in abundances. By contrast, strong selection of antagonistic interactions leads to higher temporal variation of traits and on interaction strengths.

Light is a major regulatory factor for ASC levels in plants. In this paper, we review the regulation of ASC by light and the involved biochemical and physiological processes. Several biochemical pathways for ASC biosynthesis have been proposed to exist in plants. We aim to determine the contribution of these biochemical pathways on ASC levels and, locate the steps of them that are affected by light. From biochemical and genetic studies only evidence for ASC biosynthesis occurring via the D-mannose/L-galactose biosynthetic pathway was found. Alternative pathways might account for ASC biosynthesis only in transgenic plants. Apart from biosynthesis, recycling and turnover of ASC might affect the size of the ASC pool. Light regulation of ASC levels in plants occurs primarily via effects on biosynthesis. In addition, light affects ASC homeostasis and translocation within the plant. Light regulation of ASC has been studied for individual physiological processes without taking into account possible interactions. By establishing the physiological network behind light regulation of ASC for both leaves and fruit, we developed a novel hypothesis on interactions between the physiological processes that regulate ASC.

We assessed the contribution of wildfire to forest dynamics in the eastern Cascade Mountains, USA from 1985 to 2010 using imputed maps of forest structure (i.e., tree size and canopy cover) and remotely sensed burn severity maps. We addressed three questions: (1) How do dynamics differ between the region as a whole and the unburned portion of the region? (2) How do dynamics vary among vegetation zones differing in biophysical setting and historical fire frequency? (3) How have forest structural conditions changed in a network of late successional reserves (LSRs)? Wildfires affected 10% of forests in the region, but the cumulative effects at this scale were primarily slight losses of closed-canopy conditions and slight gains in open-canopy conditions. In the unburned portion of the region (the remaining 90%), closed-canopy conditions primarily increased despite other concurrent disturbances (e.g., harvest, insects). Although the effects of fire were largely dampened at the regional scale, landscape scale dynamics were far more variable. The warm ponderosa pine and cool mixed conifer zones experienced less fire than the region as a whole despite experiencing the most frequent fire historically. Open-canopy conditions increased slightly in the mixed conifer zone, but declined across the ponderosa pine zone even with wildfires. Wildfires burned 30% of the cold subalpine zone, which experienced the greatest increase in open-canopy conditions and losses of closed-canopy conditions. LSRs were more prone to wildfire than the region as a whole, and experienced slight declines in late seral conditions. Despite losses of late seral conditions, wildfires contributed to some conservation objectives by creating open habitats (e.g., sparse early seral and woodland conditions) that otherwise generally decreased in unburned landscapes despite management efforts to increase landscape diversity. This study demonstrates the potential for wildfires to contribute to regional scale conservation objectives, but implications for management and biodiversity at landscape scales vary geographically among biophysical settings, and are contingent upon historical dynamics and individual species habitat preferences.",,,,"Lafortezza, Raffaele/G-2104-2018","Lafortezza, Raffaele/0000-0003-4642-8435; Elia, Mario/0000-0003-4382-2752; sanesi, giovanni/0000-0002-4218-3605",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,MAR,2018,28,2,,,,,291,308,,10.1002/eap.1644,,,,,,,WOS:000426499100004,29058765,,,,,

The patches of vent habitat host a network of communities (a metacommunity) connected by dispersal of planktonic larvae. The dynamics of the metacommunity are influenced not only by birth rates, death rates and interactions of populations at the local site, but also by regional influences on dispersal from different sites. The connections to other communities provide a mechanism for dynamics at a local site to affect features of the regional biota. In this paper, we explore the challenges and potential benefits of applying metacommunity theory to vent communities, with a particular focus on effects of disturbance. We synthesize field observations to inform models and identify data gaps that need to be addressed to answer key questions including: (1) what is the influence of the magnitude and rate of disturbance on ecological attributes, such as time to extinction or resilience in ametacommunity; (2) what interactions between local and regional processes control species diversity, and (3) which communities are hot spots of key ecological significance.

Plant ecologists have demonstrated the importance of traits in explaining community structure, competitive interactions as well as ecosystem functioning. The application of trait-based methods to more complex communities such as food webs is however more challenging owing to the diversity of animal characteristics and of interactions. The objective of this study was to determine how functional structure is related to food web structure. We consider that food web structure is the result of 1) the match between consumer and resource traits, which determine the occurence of a trophic interaction between them, and 2) the distribution of functional traits in the community. We implemented a statistical approach to assess whether or not 35 466 pairwise interactions between soil organisms are constrained by trait-matching and then used a Procrustes analysis to investigate correlations between functional indices and network properties across 48 sites. We found that the occurrence of trophic interactions is well predicted by matching the traits of the resource with those of the consumer. Taxonomy and body mass of both species were the most important traits for the determination of an interaction. As a consequence, functional evenness and the variance of certain traits in the community were correlated to trophic complementarity between species, while trait identity, more than diversity, was related to network topology. The analysis was however limited by trait data availability, and a coarse resolution of certain taxonomic groups in our dataset. These limitations explain the importance of taxonomy, as well as the complexity of the statistical model needed.

Achieving these goals requires well-connected networks of marine reserves that maximize larval connectivity, thus allowing exchanges between populations and recolonization after local disturbances. However, global warming can disrupt connectivity by shortening potential dispersal pathways through changes in larval physiology. These changes can compromise the performance of marine reserve networks, thus requiring adjusting their design to account for ocean warming. To date, empirical approaches to marine prioritization have not considered larval connectivity as affected by global warming. Here, we develop a framework for designing marine reserve networks that integrates graph theory and changes in larval connectivity due to potential reductions in planktonic larval duration (PLD) associated with ocean warming, given current socioeconomic constraints. Using the Gulf of California as case study, we assess the benefits and costs of adjusting networks to account for connectivity, with and without ocean warming. We compare reserve networks designed to achieve representation of species and ecosystems with networks designed to also maximize connectivity under current and future ocean-warming scenarios. Our results indicate that current larval connectivity could be reduced significantly under ocean warming because of shortened PLDs. Given the potential changes in connectivity, we show that our graph-theoretical approach based on centrality (eigenvector and distance-weighted fragmentation) of habitat patches can help design better-connected marine reserve networks for the future with equivalent costs. We found that maintaining dispersal connectivity incidentally through representation-only reserve design is unlikely, particularly in regions with strong asymmetric patterns of dispersal connectivity. Our results support previous studies suggesting that, given potential reductions in PLD due to ocean warming, future marine reserve networks would require more and/or larger reserves in closer proximity to maintain larval connectivity.",,,,"Hinojosa-Arango, Gustavo/AAK-2101-2020; Gurney, Georgina/X-9336-2019; Alvarez-Romero, Jorge G./A-4557-2009; Munguia-Vega, Adrian/AAD-9013-2019; Adams, Vanessa M./A-3834-2012; Beger, Maria/F-9049-2013","Hinojosa-Arango, Gustavo/0000-0003-4985-304X; Gurney, Georgina/0000-0002-4884-7468; Alvarez-Romero, Jorge G./0000-0002-1141-0588; Munguia-Vega, Adrian/0000-0003-3545-6510; Adams, Vanessa M./0000-0002-3509-7901; Petatan-Ramirez, David/0000-0002-0173-8950; Suarez, Alvin/0000-0003-2394-2685; Reyes-Bonilla, Hector/0000-0003-2593-9631; Beger, Maria/0000-0003-1363-3571",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,FEB,2018,24,2,,,,,E671,E691,,10.1111/gcb.13989,,,,,,,WOS:000423994700024,29274104,,,,,

In this investigation, a Bayesian Network (BN) with an expert-informed model structure was developed to predict stream vulnerability to urbanization across a range of biophysical conditions. Primary factors affecting vulnerability were stream buffers, colonization connectivity, agriculture, watershed area, and sand/gravel aquifers. On a scale from 0 to 100 (lowest to highest probability), BN model vulnerability scores ranged from a minimum of 20 to a maximum of 87.5 across the 23,554 stream catchments in our statewide study area. Catchment vulnerability scores were linked with predictions of land development suitability from a second BN model in order to map the locations of streams at risk of impairment from projected future urbanization in two large watersheds in Maine, USA. Our BN synthesis identified 5% of the streams that are at risk based on two assessment criteria: (1) their catchments have projected future impervious cover (IC) levels greater than 6% and (2) the stream catchments have predicted vulnerability scores in the highest quartile of the BN model probability distribution. These at-risk streams represent priority targets for proactive monitoring, management, and conservation efforts to avoid future degradation and expensive restoration costs. This study laid the conceptual groundwork for using BN spatial models to identify streams that are not only vulnerable to urbanization, but are also located in catchments classified with a high probability of development suitability and future urbanization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0169-2046,1872-6062,,,,FEB,2018,170,,,,,,138,149,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2017.11.001,,,,,,,WOS:000419412400013,,,,,,

Each model (1982, 1989, 1996 and 2012) represents a historical period of a clam fishery in which regulatory structure, management tools and resource status varied substantially. The results showed that this land-ocean interface experienced significant changes reflected at the population and ecosystem levels, owing to a combined effect of fishing and climate variability. Most system biomass (excluding phytoplankton and detritus) consisted of benthic invertebrates. Phytoplankton increased significantly over time, whereas the biomass of benthic macrofaunal components varied among the periods due to bottom-up processes, mass mortalities of the harvested clams and fishing intensity. Major fishing impacts on the targeted clam and mass mortalities occurred concurrently with low phytoplankton biomass, and clam recovery occurred in the absence of harvesting and increasing primary production. Ecosystem-level attributes (e.g., Total System Throughput, Ascendency) showed considerable temporal fluctuations, which were primarily related to changes in system productivity associated with a climatic shift from a cold phase to a warm phase and increasing onshore winds. An analysis of robustness and order showed an ecosystem state lacking the flexibility to adapt to new perturbations. Dynamic simulations showed the prominent bottom-up role of environmental variability on ecosystem function and structure. Temporal dynamics is conducted by changes in primary production forced mainly by temperature patterns. The concurrent role of climate variations and fishing explained the long-term dynamics of this ecosystem, suggesting that sandy beaches are fragile social-ecological systems whose services are increasingly threatened by long-lasting stressors.

However, little research has been conducted on dual pressure from climate and land cover changes on biodiversity in arid and semi-arid environments. Concequntly, it is crutial to understand the potential impacts of future climate and land cover changes on dryland biodiversity. Here, using the Chinese Altai Mountains as a case study area, we predicted the future spatial distributions and local assemblages of nine threatened mammal species under projected climate and land cover change scenarios for the period 2010-2050. The results show that remarkable declines in mammal species richness as well as high rates of species turnover are seen to occur across large areas in the Chinese Altai Mountains, highlighting an urgent need for developing protection strategies for areas outside of current nature reserve network. The selected mammals are predicted to lose more than 50% of their current ranges on average, which is much higher than species' range gains (around 15%) under future climate and land cover changes. Most of the species are predicted to contract their ranges while moving eastwards and to higher altitudes, raising the need for establishing cross-border migration pathways for species. Furthermore, the inclusion of land cover changes had notable effects on projected range shifts of individual species under climate changes, demonstrating that land cover changes should be incorporated into the assessment of future climate impacts to facilitate biodiversity conservation in arid and semi-arid environments.

The demographic explosion that marked the 20th century on the one hand caused constant growth of the need for pure water and on the other hand increased the extent of water pollution due to development of industry, intensification of agriculture and expansion of urban regions. Human action leads to greater or lesser changes of ecological factors in aquatic ecosystems (amount of dissolved oxygen, pH, heavy metal concentration, etc.), regulation of watercourses, disruption of communication between biocoenoses and disturbance of the natural water regime (through the creation of reservoirs). All of this brings about changes in biocoenoses that can be very pronounced, going even so far as to the virtual destruction of life in an aquatic ecosystem or in less severe cases to replacement of an existing biocoenosis by a new one that due to greater homogeneity of ecological factors is characterized by lower diversity. In order to conserve the water resources of the Republic of Serbia, it is necessary to monitor them closely. Biomonitoring is an obligatory part of this task because it is a simple, fast and economical way to follow the state of ecosystems of land-based water. Of all groups of aquatic organisms used in biomonitoring: bacteria, protozoans, zooplankton, phytobenthos, macrophytes and fish, macroinvertebrates are the most widely employed, especially in streams, where they are absolutely the most significant community of bioindicatory organisms. Modern biomonitoring of streams both in the world at large and in Serbia is based to the greatest extent on the use of macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of water quality owing to their many advantages over other aquatic organisms. Macroinvertebrates are widely disseminated organisms that inhabit various types of aquatic ecosystems, from little temporary (ephemeral) stagnant pools, small springs and creeks to large lakes and rivers. The great diversity of macrozoobenthic organisms and extremely complex structure of their communities on the one hand make them very sensitive to anthropogenic action causing changes of ecological factors, and on the other hand enable them potentially to respond with changes in the composition of their biocoenoses that are proportional to intensity of the anthropogenic action in question. Such organisms are characterized by the ability to persist in conditions of fast flowing water because they live attached to the bottom, possess long life cycles and have limited mobility. Their low mobility and sedentary way of life enable the investigator to establish the state of ecological factors on a given area. The relatively long life cycles (lasting 2-3 years) of these organisms make it possible to investigate changes occurring over the course of time. Apart from biological considerations, there are also numerous practical reasons why these organisms are considered good indicators of water quality: samples are taken with relatively inexpensive equipment; the taxonomy of most groups has been thoroughly elaborated; keys for their identification are available; methods that employ macrozoobenthic organisms have been used for many years and are highly reliable; and the responses of certain organisms to different types and levels of pollution have been precisely defined. Macrozoobenthic organisms can be used to test the influence of anthropogenic stress on aquatic. biotopes at all levels of biological organization, from molecular to ecosystematic. The effects of pollution on these organisms under natural conditions are most often analysed on the level of their populations or communities, using structural attributes (measured by indexes of diversity and similarity, biotic indexes, etc.) or functional characteristics, including, for example, primary production, respiratory processes, biomass (secondary production) and circulation of elements, but also aspects of the organisms' life history such as functional guilds in the feeding of a taxon. Investigation of macrozoobenthic communities has been and will be a central part of the ecology of land-based water, partly due to the fact that streams for them represent a crucial link between resources in the form of organic matter (for example, fallen leaves, algae, detritus, etc.) and fish in food webs, and partly due to the diversity and wide dissemination of the organisms involved. In view of these facts, it is unsurprising that systematic research on the fauna of macroinvertebrates in land-based water of Serbia was initiated almost a century ago and has been carried out in continuity with varying intensity up to the present day. More intensive use of macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring of the ecosystems of land-based water in Serbia, as in the world at large, began around the middle of the last century, at which time they started to be included in monitoring of water quality by the Hydrometeorological Institute of Serbia. As can be seen from the above, Serbian science actively followed world trends in biomonitoring of land-based water from the very start, although the intensity of these investigations was highly variable. Intensification of research on macroinvertebrates and their use in biomonitoring of land-based water occurred during the 1990s, with the formation in Novi Sad, Belgrade and Kragujevac of several independent teams of investigators that laid a solid foundation for further progress, as is evident in a series of studies introducing new and modern methods of biomonitoring, methods such as employment of biomarkers, recording of morphological asymmetries and deformities and use of artificial neuron networks. To be specific, the work of these teams has greatly advanced available knowledge about biology of the macroinvertebrates of land-based water in Serbia and continued to keep pace with world trends in their use for biomonitoring. A good example is the development of BNBI and incorporation of a number of EU standard methods into norms for regulation of biomonitoring in Serbia. Despite this positive trend, it must be stated that the use of macroinvertebrates as bioindicators of the quality of land-based water in Serbia is relatively limited because in the majority of cases it is done within the framework of saprobiological analyses, whereas biotic indexes are for the most part unjustifiably ignored, while multimetric indexes and the multivariant approach have not even begun to be employed. For these reasons, the state of biomomitoring in Serbia still cannot be considered satisfactory. To be specific, if the extent of land-based water biomonitoring in Great Britain where it is continuously conducted at more than 6000 localities is compared with the state of affairs in Serbia where about 90 localities out of a planned 500 are continuously monitored it can be seen that the level of biomonitoring in our country is disproportionally lower. Moreover, a comparison of stream quality in Great Britain, despite that country's significantly more advanced industrial development and greater population density, with the situation in Serbia shows that the quality of streams in our country is conspicuously far worse. It is clearly necessary to expand the volume and content of biomonitoring because only in that way will it be possible to make correct decisions in the management of water resources and thereby improve their quality. Meanwhile, at the existing level of macroinvertebrate studies in Serbia, that is not simply a question of political willingness, but also a task limited by the quality and quantity of fundamental research. As has been stated before, successful use of macroinvertebrates in biomonitoring demands an exceptionally good knowledge of the base reference state. That at the present time calls for additional faunistic, taxonomic, biogeographic and toxicological research, as well as studies on the typization of watercourses. It will be possible to define groups of reference localities in Serbia, as has been done in Great Britain, only if the inventory of species in our country is known in detail, if taxonomic problems are resolved, if keys for the identification of species are available, if their range has been clarified and if the types of watercourses and their ecological status (condition) are known. This in turn will make it possible to apply some highly organized system of biomonitoring like RIVPACS or to develop a multimetric index like the ones elaborated in the EU's AQEM program. That the path to this goal is long is clearly indicated by the fact although acknowledged experts today exist for the taxonomy of macroinvertebrate groups such as Chironomidae, Oligochaeta, Heteroptera, Trichoptera, Amphipoda and Gastropoda, research on a number of very important groups such as Ephemeroptera and Plecoptera has only just begun, a situation that has a significant effect on the quality and reliability of determination of these groups, knowledge about their distribution and awareness of their ecological preferences, as well as on the typization of land-based water habitats in Serbia vis-a-vis other countries in the world. Progress in this area largely depends on politics of the state, that is on the measure in which it is ready to support studies, finance the necessary increase in the number of researchers and through selection of programs and projects guide investigative efforts in an appropriate direction. It is also necessary to widen the network of localities at which sampling is prescribed by law, since only by sampling in an organized and planned manner will it be possible to collect an adequate number of data in a procedurally uniform way permitting the drawing of comparisons, development of new biomononitoring methods in Serbia and improvement of ones already in existence. That is the only way to form a standardized database of information about the ecosystems of Serbian streams. Such a database will be the foundation needed for the standardization of reference localities, which represents a key step toward the implementation of both multivariant and multimetric methods in biomonitoring.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1452-7375,,978-86-7025-777-1,,,,2018,171,,,,,,199,229,,,,,,,,,WOS:000485068200007,,,,,,

Here, we synthesized all available distribution data (>1 million records) since 1992 for 61 species of the East Australian marine ecosystem, a global hot spot of ocean warming and continuing fisheries exploitation. Using a novel approach, we constructed networks of the annual changes in geographical overlaps between species. Using indices of changes in species overlap, we quantified changes in the ecosystem stability, species robustness, species sensitivity and structural keystone species. We then compared the species overlap indices with environmental and fisheries data to identify potential factors leading to the changes in distributional overlaps between species. We found that the structure of the ecosystem has changed with a decrease in asymmetrical geographical overlaps between species. This suggests that the ecosystem has become less stable and potentially more susceptible to environmental perturbations. Most species have shown a decrease in overlaps with other species. The greatest decrease in species overlap robustness and sensitivity to the loss of other species has occurred in the pelagic community. Some demersal species have become more robust and less sensitive. Pelagic structural keystone species, predominately the tunas and billfish, have been replaced by demersal fish species. The changes in species overlap were strongly correlated with regional oceanographic changes, in particular increasing ocean warming and the southward transport of warmer and saltier water with the East Australian Current, but less correlated with fisheries catch. Our study illustrates how large-scale multispecies distribution changes can help identify structural changes in marine ecosystems associated with climate change.",,,,"; Strutton, Peter/C-4466-2011","Semmens, Jayson/0000-0003-1742-6692; Strutton, Peter/0000-0002-2395-9471",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,JAN,2018,24,1,,,,,E90,E100,,10.1111/gcb.13891,,,,,,,WOS:000426506100008,28869695,,,,,

Disturbance that affects part of the network may represent an abrupt change in environmental gradients, which should be reflected on its communities. We analysed whether the composition of benthic insect communities is associated to environmental and geographic distances in a small catchment, partially disturbed by a wildfire (non burned forest-control: C, moderate impacted: I and burned zones: B). We postulated that changes in main resource availability differently affect certain functional feeding groups. We found that taxonomic differences were related to the disturbance condition but not to the distance among streams and that the effect of disturbance targeted mostly on shredders. Environmental differences were larger among C sites than among B sites, but community taxonomic composition was more similar among C than B sites. As a result, neither environmental nor geographic distances explained community similarity. When the analysis was scaled up by incorporating new data from a larger area, community similarity was explained both by environmental and geographic distance, independently (i.e. geographic and environmental distances did not correlate). Our results highlight the influence of a disturbance on the riparian vegetation on the benthic community composition and functional structure of forested streams, and showed the effect of scale in habitat association, as environmental and geographic distance together explained community similarity when the spatial scale was enlarged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0912-3814,1440-1703,,,,JAN,2018,33,1,,,,,225,236,,10.1007/s11284-017-1539-z,,,,,,,WOS:000422907900020,,,,,,

We quantified arthropod biomass after manipulating soil nutrient availability and wild mammalian herbivory, using identical methods across 13 temperate grasslands. Of experimental increases in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, only treatments including nitrogen resulted in significantly increased arthropod biomass. Wild mammalian herbivore removal had a marginal, negative effect on arthropod biomass, with no interaction with nutrient availability. Path analysis including all sites implicated nutrient content of the primary producers as a driver of increased arthropod mean size, which we confirmed using 10 sites for which we had foliar nutrient data. Plant biomass and physical structure mediated the increase in arthropod abundance, while the nitrogen treatments accounted for additional variation not explained by our measured plant variables. The mean size of arthropod individuals was 2.5 times more influential on the plot-level total arthropod biomass than was the number of individuals.

Bottom trawling is considered one of the greatest and most widespread causes of anthropogenic change in shelf seas, with major and prolonged impacts in areas with a long history of exploitation by fisheries such as the North Atlantic. Here, signs of recovery following the enforcement of regulations are increasingly being reported. 2. We examined the extent to which biological diversity and functionality are restored when fishing pressure is reduced by evaluating changes in species biomass and that of the main functional groups present in the continental platform, as obtained from systematic survey (IBTS) results. Moreover, we examined how this recovery is mirrored in the trophic organization of the affected communities by assessing variations in link density and strength of the main consumer species and investigating whether variations in species richness were paralleled by changes in network properties. Finally, we investigated whether reductions in fishing pressure (fishing mortality) were correlated with the abovementioned variations in community and trophic structure of the bentho-demersal assemblages. 3. Our results corroborate the apparent recovery of North Atlantic fishing stocks and further substantiate the improved welfare of the bentho-demersal assemblages of the Southern Bay of Biscay. Specifically, we found an increase in species richness and in the abundance of most functional groups, especially those more closely related to the benthos, following the reduction in fishing mortality. Increases in overall species richness were paralleled by an increase in the number of links and a reduction in mean interaction strength connecting the main consumer species with their prey items. This is in accordance with ecological theory and could explain the mechanism by which bentho-demersal assemblages restructure their trophic network towards more stable organizations. 4. Synthesis and applications. Detecting patterns of recovery or change to alternative stable states following stress release is essential to unravel the effects of perturbations and to design effective management strategies. Our study shows that trophic network properties provide a convincing tool to evaluate and perceive recovery patterns. The trends shown in our study appear to be related with the decline in fishing mortality resulting from the enforcement of fisheries regulations in the area. They substantiate the efficiency of these regulations as a guarantee for an ecosystem approach to fisheries management and advocate their enforcement at a wider level as a convincing measure to preserve the sustainability of marine resources and their welfare.",,,,"Punzon, Antonio/AAC-6717-2020; Preciado, Izaskun/K-9029-2014; Lopez-Lopez, Lucia/L-2066-2017","Preciado, Izaskun/0000-0002-0934-9423; Arroyo, Nina Larissa/0000-0003-1502-1245; Lopez-Lopez, Lucia/0000-0003-3740-7392",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,DEC,2017,54,6,,,,,1957,1967,,10.1111/1365-2664.12879,,,,,,,WOS:000415194000036,,,,,,

Ecological network analysis (ENA) was used to explore ecosystem functioning following disturbances to food web networks of a South African estuary, Mdloti, under different seasons. Keystone species, in particular, play an important structural role in spite of having low levels of presence in terms of biomass. From networks of carbon exchanges, the keystone species are identified which include high trophic level carnivorous fish species like Argyrosomus japonicus, Caranx sexfasciatus and Monodactylus falciformis. It is observed that keystone species differed between seasons, according to changing conditions of the estuary. The positive and negative direct and indirect effects that the keystone species have on the different components of the system are evaluated by a Mixed Trophic Impacts (MTI) analysis and results of the direct-indirect impacts analysis are not consistent across seasons. Results reinforce the fact that the keystone species are context dependent as they show variation over the different networks following species composition change following alteration of the estuaries physical status and season.

However, the changes in network interactions associated with turnover in community composition have seldom been assessed. Here we examine whether changes in ecological networks are best detected by standard emergent network metrics or by assessing internal network changes (i.e. interaction and composition turnover). To eliminate possible spatial or phylogenetic effects, that in large-scale studies may obscure mechanisms structuring networks and interactions, we sampled multiple antagonistic (plant-herbivore) networks for a single diverse plant family (the Restionaceae) in the hyperdiverse Cape Floristic Region. These are the first plant-herbivore networks constructed for this global biodiversity hotspot. We found invariant emergent network structure despite considerable changes in insect and plant composition across communities over time and space. In contrast, there was high interaction turnover between networks. Seasonally, this was driven by turnover in insect species and insect host switching. Spatially, this was driven by simultaneous turnover in plant and insect species, suggesting that many insects are host specific or that both groups exhibit parallel responses to environmental gradients. Spatial interaction turnover was also driven by turnover in plants, showing that many insects can utilise multiple (possibly closely related) hosts and this may create divergent selection gradients that promote insect speciation. Thus we show highly variable interaction fidelity, despite invariant emergent network structure. We suggest that evaluating internal network changes may be more effective at elucidating the processes structuring networks, and many fine-scale changes may be obscured when only calculating emergent network metrics.",,,,"Evans, Darren Mark/J-9782-2012; Ellis, Allan/H-1105-2011","Ellis, Allan/0000-0001-6310-2870; Kemp, Jurene/0000-0001-6615-6508",,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,NOV,2017,40,11,,,,,1315,1324,,10.1111/ecog.02150,,,,,,,WOS:000413580700007,,,,,,

Empirical studies have found that the mutualistic interactions forming the structure of plant-pollinator networks are typically more nested than expected by chance alone. Additionally, theoretical studies have shown a positive association between the nested structure of mutualistic networks and community persistence. Yet, it has been shown that some plant-pollinator networks may be more nested than others, raising the interesting question of which factors are responsible for such enhanced nested structure. 2. It has been argued that ordered network structures may increase the persistence of ecological communities under less predictable environments. This suggests that nested structures of plant-pollinator networks could be more advantageous under highly seasonal environments. While several studies have investigated the link between nestedness and various environmental variables, unfortunately, there has been no unified answer to validate these predictions. Here, we move from the problem of describing network structures to the problem of comparing network structures. We develop comparative statistics, and apply them to investigate the association between the nested structure of 59 plant-pollinator networks and the temperature seasonality present in their locations. 3. We demonstrate that higher levels of nestedness are associated with a higher temperature seasonality. We show that the previous lack of agreement came from an extended practice of using standardized measures of nestedness that cannot be compared across different networks. 4. Importantly, our observations complement theory showing that more nested network structures can increase the range of environmental conditions compatible with species coexistence in mutualistic systems, also known as structural stability. This increase in nestedness should be more advantageous and occur more often in locations subject to random environmental perturbations, which could be driven by highly changing or seasonal environments. This synthesis of theory and observations could prove relevant for a better understanding of the ecological processes driving the assembly and persistence of ecological communities.",,,,"Rohr, Rudolf Philippe/K-9232-2015; Song, Chuliang/J-3231-2019","Rohr, Rudolf Philippe/0000-0002-6440-2696; Song, Chuliang/0000-0001-7490-8626",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,NOV,2017,86,6,,,,,1417,1424,,10.1111/1365-2656.12749,,,,,,,WOS:000413406700014,28833083,,,,,

Furthermore, fire events could affect the architecture of plant-pollinator interaction networks, modifying the structure and function of communities. Some pollinators, such as wood-nesting bees, may be particularly affected by fire events due to damage to the nesting material and its long regeneration time. However, it remains unclear whether fire influences the structure of bee-plant interactions. Here, we used quantitative plant-wood-nesting bee interaction networks sampled across four different post-fire age categories (from freshly-burnt to unburnt sites) in an arid ecosystem to test whether the abundance of wood-nesting bees, the breadth of resource use and the plant-bee community structure change along a post-fire age gradient. We demonstrate that freshly-burnt sites present higher abundances of generalist than specialist wood-nesting bees and that this translates into lower network modularity than that of sites with greater post-fire ages. Bees do not seem to change their feeding behaviour across the post-fire age gradient despite changes in floral resource availability. Despite the effects of fire on plant-bee interaction network structure, these mutualistic networks seem to be able to recover a few years after the fire event.

This network collected environmental and genetic samples, habitat data, and management information to identify environmental and plant community associations of Phragmites invasion and patterns of management responses. Fifty managers overseeing 209 Phragmites stands in 16 US states and ON, Canada participated.

Relative to the native lineage, non-native Phragmites occurred in areas with higher nitrate/nitrite and ammonium than non-native Phragmites. Stand interiors had higher soil electrical conductivity than nearby uninvaded areas, consistent with use of road salt promoting spread of Phragmites. Non-native Phragmites co-occurred with fewer plant species than native Phragmites and was actively targeted for management. Herbicide was applied to 51% of non-native stands; surprisingly, 11% of native stands were also treated with herbicide.

Understanding pollination dynamics in agricultural systems is thus essential to help maintain this ecosystem service in the face of human disturbances. Surprisingly, our understanding of plant-pollinator interactions in widely distributed smallholder agricultural systems is still limited. Knowledge of pollination dynamics in these agricultural systems is necessary to fully assess how human disturbances may affect pollination services worldwide. In this study, we describe the structure of a plant-floral visitor network in a smallholder Cucurbitaceae agricultural system. We further identify the main floral visitors of these crops and tested their importance by simulating how their extinction affected network structure and robustness. The observed network was highly connected and generalized but it was neither nested nor compartmentalized. Our results suggest that the structure of agricultural plant-pollinator networks could be inherently different from those in natural communities. These differences in network structure may reflect differences in spatial distribution of floral resources between agricultural and natural systems. We identified Augochlora nigrocyanea and Peponapis limitaris as the two most frequent floral visitors. However, removal of these species did not affect network structure or its robustness, suggesting high levels of interaction rewiring.

The seasonally pulsing flow permitted the coexistence of ridge and slough vegetation, including the persistence of productive, well-connected sloughs that seasonally concentrated prey and supported wading bird nesting success. Here we review factors contributing to the origin and to degradation of the ridge and slough ecosystem in an attempt to answer How much flow is needed to restore functionality? A key restoration objective is to increase sheetflow lost during the past century to reestablish interactions between flow, water depth, vegetation production and decomposition, and transport of flocculent organic sediment that build and maintain ridge and slough distinctions. Our review finds broad agreement that perturbations of water level depth and its fluctuations were primary in the degradation of landscape functions, with critical contributions from perturbed water quality, and flow velocity and direction. Whereas water levels are expected to be improved on average across a range of restoration scenarios that replace between 79 and 91% of predrainage flows, the diminished microtopography substantially decreases the probability of timely improvements in some areas whereas others that retain microtopographic differences are poised for restoration benefits.

This is an important gap in model development, particularly for end-to-end ecosystem models, which are becoming increasingly important tools for fisheries and ecosystem based management and assessment. Examination of large-scale and widely-applied pelagic end-to-end ecosystem models indicates that representations of predators are currently best developed for fish groups. The methods for modelling seabirds and marine mammals on the other hand, are less well developed. This is potentially due to the challenges involved in data collection and in representing the complex life histories of many of these species. To examine the effect that different representations of higher trophic level predators might have on ecosystem model predictions, we developed a set of simple nested qualitative network models and examined their responses to perturbations. Responses differed between models across a range of trophic levels under a simple scenario for environmental change, highlighting that how predators are modelled can have implications for ecosystem-level predictions. We conclude with a discussion around potential approaches for developing more detailed representations of predator groups, and suggest incorporating dynamic energy budget theory in individual-based models to represent higher trophic level predators with more complex life histories.

In spite of the long lasting efforts to predict them, we still lack a real integrated framework to grasp their behaviours. In this paper, the concept of ecosystem development is proposed to understand the sharp regime shifts they cumulate over the long term. To handle regime shifts, we develop an integrated model merging the physical, biological and social components and interactions (processes) of an ecosystem into a single graph representation. We then formalize sharp structural (topological) changes of the system with Boolean networks. We illustrate this theoretical approach borrowed from discrete model formalisms on some ecosystems assumed to be representative of most ecosystems: the eusocial (termite and ant) insect colonies and their associated interactions. Boolean networks, combined with rigorous production/rewriting rules and syntax, simulate the ecosystem's responses to strong perturbations. This deterministic and qualitative approach allows identifying fragile components, analysing ecosystem resilience to perturbations and to map out every lethal trajectory of the ecosystem. In our models, termite colonies appear to be almost six times less vulnerable to perturbations than ant colonies, and need (8%) more time steps to collapse. This robust result was partly due to the higher number of essential nodes in ant ecosystems, and partly due to interactions related to the ants' vertebrate predators. The rigorous and parsimonious abilities of such discrete models pave the way in reinterpreting and managing a wide range of ecosystems.

I sampled species composition of bird-flocks attending army-ant raids in three adjacent elevation zones in Costa Rica, across multiple years, to test for positive and negative associations among raid-attending bird species. My goal was to test whether the most frequent and specialized raid-attending species showed evidence of facilitating or excluding other bird species. I quantified elevational variation in avian community composition at raids, then asked whether species composition was associated with variation in flock characteristics (flock size and species richness). I identified the most frequent raid-attending species (those that attended raids most frequently relative to their mist-net capture rates), and bird species that performed specialized army ant-following behavior (bivouac-checking, which allows birds to memorize and track mobile army-ant colonies). There was significant turnover of bird species among zones (including the frequent and specialized attendants); patterns of species overlap suggested a gradual transition from a Pacific-slope to an Atlantic-slope raid-attending bird fauna. Raid-attendance frequency was positively correlated with bivouac-checking behavior. With few exceptions, the most frequent raid-attending bird species, and the bivouac-checking species, also participated in the most species-rich flocks. High species-gregariousness suggests many of the frequently attending and/or bivouac-checking species functioned as core flock members. However, some bird species pairs were significantly negatively associated at raids. Despite species turnover, per-flock numbers of birds at raids did not differ among geographic zones, but flocks on the Pacific-slope were heavier because larger bodied bird species attended raids. Previous studies showed that the size (biomass) of bird-flocks corresponds to the amount of food the birds kleptoparasitize from ant raids, and the heavier Pacific-slope bird-flocks could have greater negative kleptoparasitic impacts.

Here, we examine differences in the abilities of derived and field-measured variables to explain and predict biogeographical patterns of freshwater fish and benthic invertebrate communities. Location: Maryland first-through fourth-order streams, USA. Methods: We fit generalized dissimilarity models to fish and benthic invertebrate occurrence data (n = 2,165 site-years sampled over 18 years) using one set of field-measured predictors collected concurrent and collocated with faunal sampling, two sets of derived predictors (one representing local and one representing upstream conditions) or a combination. We then compared how well models explained and predicted spatial turnover in taxonomic composition (beta diversity). Results: For all regions (four physiographic regions and the state as a whole) and for both fish and benthic invertebrates, models fit with field-measured variables were more explanatory and usually more predictive than models fit with derived variables. Within the category of derived predictors, those accounting for upstream conditions were more explanatory and predictive than local-scale versions. Main conclusions: Although derived variables are most commonly used to describe and map biodiversity, they may be broadly inferior to field-measured variables as predictors in low-order stream biodiversity models.

This reorganization can also be associated with the extent to which species change their preference for types of niches available in their local sites. Despite the pervasiveness of these interaction changes, previous studies have revealed that network reorganizations have a minimal or insignificant effect on global descriptors of network architecture, such as connectance, modularity and nestedness. However, little is known about whether these reorganizations may have an effect on community dynamics and composition. To answer the question above, we study the multi-year dynamics and reorganization of plant-herbivore interaction networks across secondary successional stages of a tropical dry forest. We develop new quantitative tools based on a structural stability approach to estimate the potential impact of network reorganization on species persistence. Then, we investigate whether this impact can explain the likelihood of persistence of herbivore species in the observed communities. We find that resident (early-arriving) herbivore species increase their likelihood of persistence across time and successional stages. Importantly, we demonstrate that, in late successional stages, the reorganization of interactions among resident species has a strong inhibitory effect on the likelihood of persistence of colonizing (late-arriving) herbivores. These findings support earlier predictions suggesting that, in mature communities, changes of species interactions can act as community-control mechanisms (also known as priority effects).

Robustness of Bakreswar reservoir system has been studied here following hypothetical perturbation scenarios that represent possible real situations of eutrophication (nutrient loading) and over fishing. Quite a few descriptive ecosystem indices have also been considered for the current study including Total System Throughflow (TST), Finn Cycling Index (FC1), Redundancy (R), Ascendancy (A), Developmental capacity (C), Total Primary Production to Total Respiration ratio (TPP/TR), Total Primary Production to Total Biomass Ratio (TPP/TB), detritivory to herbivory ratio and also the Exergy of the system. It is concluded from this study that the Bakreswar reservoir is a moderately stable ecosystem with fair maturity level and is able to withstand stress for a reasonable extent. The network indices revealed that variation in robustness of the system is related more with fish biomass perturbation scenario rather than that for the autotroph biomass perturbations. This is confirmed by the network indices as well as the change in the system exergy values which shows more variation in the fish biomass scenario.",,,,"Banerjee, Arnab/AAF-7520-2020","RAKSHIT, NABYENDU/0000-0003-2989-360X; Banerjee, Arnab/0000-0001-7732-1687",,,,,,,,,,,,1470-160X,1872-7034,,,,SEP,2017,80,,,,,,163,173,,10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.05.021,,,,,,,WOS:000406436100017,,,,,,

However, while lake, wetland, and stream abundance has been estimated at regional and global extents, less attention has been paid to freshwater connectivity attributes among aquatic systems at macroscales. Thus, regional to continental patterns of freshwater abundance and connectivity are poorly understood. We measured lake, wetland, and stream abundance and surface connectivity attributes (i.e., landscape position within stream networks) at a subcontinental extent in the Midwest and Northeast United States to characterize macroscale spatial patterns of the freshwater landscape (i.e., abundance and connectivity attributes of lakes, wetlands, and streams). We found that lake and wetland abundance exhibited opposite spatial patterns from stream density that generally followed glaciation extent boundaries-lake and wetland abundance was high north of the glaciation boundary, whereas stream density was high south of the glaciation boundary. Freshwater connectivity attributes exhibited distinct spatial patterns as defined by our integrated freshwater clusters and revealed a layer of complexity not captured by abundance measures. Patterns of freshwater abundance and connectivity in the study extent were associated primarily with glaciation and secondarily with hydrogeomorphic (e.g., surficial geology and topography), climate (e.g., runoff), and land-use (e.g., agriculture) variables, providing insight into potential drivers of freshwater composition and distribution. The connectivity spatial patterns observed suggest that relying solely on freshwater abundance measures in macroscale analyses omits unique information on the structural attributes of freshwater systems that can be critical to key ecological processes. Adopting an integrated freshwater landscape framework to study and manage freshwaters is essential as freshwater systems face broad-scale disturbances that may alter hydrologic connections and subsequently may impact ecosystem processes and services.",,,,,"Spence Cheruvelil, Kendra/0000-0003-1880-2880; Lapierre, Jean-Francois/0000-0001-5862-7955; Webster, Katherine/0000-0002-6009-0146",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,AUG,2017,8,8,,,,,,,e01911,10.1002/ecs2.1911,,,,,,,WOS:000409094000008,,,,,,

Interactions between fire and other processes that affect animal distributions, however, cause variation in faunal responses to fire and limit our ability to identify appropriate fire management regimes for biodiversity conservation. Bayesian networks (BNs) have not previously been used to examine terrestrial faunal distributions in relation to fire, but offer an alternative statistical framework for modeling complex environmental relationships as they explicitly capture interactions between predictor variables. We developed a conceptual model of the interactions between drivers of faunal distributions in fire-affected landscapes, and then used a non-parametric BN modeling approach to describe and quantify these relationships for a suite of terrestrial native mammal species. We also tested whether BNs could be used to predict these species' distributions using only remote-sensed or mapped variables. Data were collected at 113 sites across 47,000 ha of continuous eucalypt forest in the Otway Ranges, southeastern Australia; time-since-fire (TSF) ranged from six months to 74 yr. Habitat complexity increased with TSF and forest wetness. Critical-weight-range (35-5500 g) marsupials and rodents were generally more likely to occur at long unburnt sites with high habitat complexity, and in wetter forest types. In contrast, large grazers and browsers preferred less complex habitats and younger or drier forest. Species occurrences were more strongly affected by habitat complexity than TSF, coarse woody debris cover, or invasive predator (Vulpes vulpes or Felis catus) occurrence. Bayesian network models effectively discriminated between the presence and absence of most native mammal species, even when only provided with data on remote-sensed or mapped variables (i.e., without field-assessed data such as habitat complexity).

Understanding compositional patterns in aquatic biota is a useful step towards better management of aquatic ecosystems. We used generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM) to predict compositional turnover in riverine invertebrate fauna (primarily insects) as a function of environment. Conceptual understanding of major drivers of aquatic invertebrate species distribution helped decide which predictor variables to source and include. Five groups of environmental variableswaterscape, local habitat, climate, landscape and disturbancewere derived from either spatial layers or insitu (site) measurements. Predictive models and variance partitioning tests of variable groups demonstrated the importance of representing all conceptual drivers of ecological pattern and process. As expected, waterscape variables were independently the most important group, followed by local habitat and landscape variables; with complex interactions between groups. Climate variables independently contributed the least. To determine the information content for mapping patterns, we investigated the independent and combined contribution of site-measured and spatial predictors. Even though predictive models developed using only site-measured variables or only spatial variables explained around the same amount of deviance (DE), combined they increased explained model DE by 11.2%. Compositional dissimilarities between the 51 surveyed site pairs predicted by the model using only spatial variables were highly correlated (r(2)=.85) with dissimilarities predicted using site and spatial variables. These results support the use of the spatial model for conservation decisions. The spatial model was used to evaluate representativeness of both the conservation reserve network and biological monitoring locations. The location of aquatic monitoring sites was uneven, with comprehensive coverage south and coastward, and less representative of inland environments. Proportional protection of ecological environments (scaled by riverine invertebrate taxa) was found to vary between 20% and 30%, being higher in southern parts where more land has been allocated to reserves and less in northern and inland parts. This demonstrated local progress towards achieving the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11 for inland waters. These results provide a focus for improving the robustness of information used in decisions affecting the conservation of aquatic biodiversity, including places to target to fill gaps in the reserve network and additional aquatic monitoring locations (supporting Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 19). The GDM-based approach to characterising ecological environments, provided a first quantitative foundation for comprehensively evaluating the conservation status of freshwater ecosystems in south-western Australia.

Variation partitioning was used to assess the independent and cumulative effects of environmental predictors, with vegetation structure being derived from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. We also checked for independent effects of plant and woody plant beta diversity on butterfly and bird beta diversity, respectively, and for independent effects of spatial distance on beta diversity. Results: Climate emerged as the strongest statistical predictor of beta diversity across taxonomic groups, with large independent effects on species turnover. Climate effects were most pronounced for plants, followed by butterflies and birds. We also found large independent effects of vegetation structure on total beta diversity and its turnover component across taxonomic groups, particularly for birds. Plant and woody plant beta diversity substantially improved the predictions of butterfly and bird beta diversity, respectively. Spatial distance had hardly any independent effect on beta diversity. Main conclusions: Climate is a stronger filter for plant communities than for butterfly and bird communities, which are more affected by vegetation structure, probably owing to associated resources and niches. Vegetation structure is a crucial predictor of beta diversity, and therefore contiguous and detailed 3-D habitat structure data are highly relevant to further our understanding of niche-based community assembly.

Location: Mount Kilimanjaro. Time period: Sampling between November 2013 and October 2015. Major taxa studied: Fleshy-fruited plants, frugivorous birds. Methods: We sampled plant and bird communities along an elevational and a human disturbance gradient and measured corresponding morphological traits of plants and birds to calculate indices of functional identity and functional diversity of plant and bird communities. We used structural equation models to disentangle direct and indirect effects of all variables on functional identity and diversity of frugivorous bird communities. Results: Both functional identity and diversity of frugivorous bird communities were consistently related to the functional identity and diversity of plant communities. Climate had almost exclusively indirect effects on functional identity and diversity of bird communities mediated through effects on plant functional identity and diversity. In contrast, human disturbance also had direct negative effects on bird diversity. Main conclusions: We show that plant functional identity and diversity are the most important drivers of functional identity and diversity of frugivorous birds. Although effects of climate on bird communities are almost exclusively mediated indirectly through plant communities, human disturbance resulted in a direct reduction of bird diversity.

We compared the strengths of varying levels of effort (field measures, laboratory chemistry, land use, and multiple combinations of these) to explain macroinvertebrate assemblage response along a gradient of urban land use intensity among 30 headwater streams in northern West Virginia. Because the spatial arrangement of human disturbance can govern biotic response, land use effects were analyzed at five spatial scales (whole catchment, and 100 m buffer zone at three fixed upstream distances and total stream network upstream of site); instream ecological measures included physical habitat, algal concentrations and water chemistry. Of the five spatial scales, we predicted that riparian land use nearest the site would explain the most variation but that instream measures would be the overall driver of the macroinvertebrate assemblages. Regression analysis evaluated the strength of single and multiple variables in explaining macroinvertebrate multimetric index (MMI) and ordination patterns, and revealed that assemblages were highly responsive to numerous stressors. In contrast to predictions, total upstream network riparian forest cover explained the most variation overall (83%) while specific conductance was the single best instream measure (64%). Stepwise regression models using combinations of field, laboratory, and land use variables all performed reasonably well but we found that a 3-variable model [% forest (catchment), road density, and specific conductance] that minimized colinearity and cost/effort explained 90% of the variation in the MMI.

Interactions between resource and consumer species result in complex ecological networks. The overall structure of these networks is often stable in space and time, but little is known about the temporal stability of the functional roles of consumer species in these networks. 2. We used a trait-based approach to investigate whether consumers (frugivorous birds) show similar degrees of functional specialisation on resources (plants) in ecological networks across seasons. We additionally tested whether closely related bird species have similar degrees of functional specialisation and whether birds that are functionally specialised on specific resource types within a season are flexible in switching to other resource types in other seasons. 3. We analysed four seasonal replicates of two species-rich plant-frugivore networks from the tropical Andes. To quantify fruit preferences of frugivorous birds, we projected their interactions with plants into a multidimensional plant trait space. To measure functional specialisation of birds, we calculated a species' functional niche breadth (the extent of seasonal plant trait space utilised by a particular bird) and functional originality (the extent to which a bird species' fruit preference functionally differs from those of other species in a seasonal network). We additionally calculated functional flexibility, i.e. the ability of bird species to change their fruit preference across seasons in response to variation in plant resources. 4. Functional specialisation of bird species varied more among species than across seasons, and phylogenetically similar bird species showed similar degrees of functional niche breadth (phylogenetic signal lambda = 0.81) and functional originality (lambda = 0.89). Additionally, we found that birds with high functional flexibility across seasons had narrow functional niche breadth and high functional originality per season, suggesting that birds that are seasonally specialised on particular resources are most flexible in switching to other fruit resources across seasons. 5. The high flexibility of functionally specialised bird species to switch seasonally to other resources challenges the view that consumer species rely on functionally similar resources throughout the year. This flexibility of consumer species may be an important, but widely neglected mechanism that could potentially stabilise consumer-resource networks in response to human disturbance and environmental change.",,,,"Kuhn, Ingolf/B-9756-2009; Wiegand, Thorsten/H-5877-2016; Schleuning, Matthias/H-2154-2015; Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/W-2601-2019","Kuhn, Ingolf/0000-0003-1691-8249; Wiegand, Thorsten/0000-0002-3721-2248; Schleuning, Matthias/0000-0001-9426-045X; Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/0000-0003-0477-5586",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JUL,2017,86,4,,,,,800,811,,10.1111/1365-2656.12683,,,,,,,WOS:000403146400010,28493450,,,,,

In turn, human disturbances alter both the original animal assemblage with which plants interact and the outcome of the mutualistic interaction. Negative consequences of human disturbances can be weakened when different seed dispersers exert similar effects on plant populations, being functionally equivalent. To understand the consequences of variability in seed dispersers on the recruitment of a long-lived tree species, I assessed changes in the assemblages of avian dispersers of Podocarpus parlatorei in subtropical Andean cloud-forests, and how these changes affect the outcome of the interaction at different spatial scales. The seed dispersal effectiveness (SDE) concept, defined as the likelihood of a seed removed by a fruit-eating bird to be dispersed to a suitable site for seed survival and germination, provides the framework to compare the contributions of different birds to seed dispersal. I compared the SDE in two old-growth forests dominated by P. parlatorei and a human disturbed forest, and in the main habitat types of these sites. In all sites, highest SDE values were provided by gulpers that swallow the whole fleshy cone (fruit), predominantly Elaenia and Turdus species. SDE was highest in forest edges and secondary forests, and negligible in other habitats. Equivalence in SDE was relatively low both within and between forest sites. Human forest disturbance modified the functional equivalence, the generalization in mutualistic interactions and the strength of SDE. Secondary forests showed the higher SDE and the greater richness of dispersers high in SDE; as a consequence, the ecological equivalence increased in the most suitable habitat for recruitment. This could lead to greater resilience of plant populations to local extinctions of dispersers, and allows the recovery of human disturbed forests. This study shows that in the replacement of functional equivalent species, the outcomes of the interactions are strongly affected by disperser abundance and habitat use, at the expense of dispersers' trait redundancy on plant population dynamics and community structure.",,,,,"Blendinger, Pedro G./0000-0002-2130-9934",,,,,,,,,,,,2296-701X,,,,,JUN 9,2017,5,,,,,,,,57,10.3389/fevo.2017.00057,,,,,,,WOS:000451570200001,,,,,,

Riparian forest is thus a green infrastructure for biodiversity conservation. However, a long history of landscape alteration now calls for maintenance and restoration by ecological engineering. This study evaluates management guidelines advocating constant vs. variable width of riparian forest protected zones in managed landscapes. In naturally dynamic forests, stands with gap-phase dynamic along streams often provide a network of habitats with a high degree of continuity in tree canopy cover and dead wood for biodiversity conservation and delivery of ecosystem services including water purification. Based on the observation that tall herb sites indicate a potential for temporally continuous forest cover, we tested three null hypotheses. Tall herb sites ( 1) are equally common in the riparian zone and in the surrounding forest landscape; ( 2) have the same width on both sides of a stream; and ( 3) their widths are independent of the width of the adjacent stream. We described the ground vegetation in transects along and perpendicular to streams, and in the surrounding landscape, in six 3rd stream order catchment located in Sweden, Lithuania and the Komi Republic of Russia. The results showed that tall herb sites were 21-27 times more common along streams compared to in the rest of the landscape, the width of tall herb sites varied considerably along streams, and it was independent of the width of the adjacent stream. This study suggests that rather than fixed-width guidelines for riparian set-asides, to support cost-efficient maintenance of riparian forest, local site conditions should be used as guide for planning, maintenance and engineering of riparian ecotones. Because tall herb forest sites were historically cleared for agricultural purposes, the potential natural amount of riparian forest is severely underestimated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, environmental change may re-organise network structure limiting capacity to absorb or resist shocks and increasing species extinctions. We investigated if habitat disturbance and the level of mutualism dependence between species affected the robustness of insect-flower visitation networks Following a recently developed Stochastic Co-extinction Model (SCM), we ran simulations to produce the number of extinction episodes (cascade degree), which we correlated with network structure in undisturbed and disturbed habitat. We also explicitly modelled whether a species' intrinsic dependence on mutualism affected the propensity for extinction cascades in the network. Habitat disturbance generated a gradient in network structure with those from disturbed sites being less connected, but more speciose and so larger. Controlling for network size (z-score standardisation against the null model) revealed that disturbed networks had disproportionately low linkage density, high specialisation, fewer insect visitors per plant species (vulnerability) and lower nestedness (NODF). This network structure gradient driven by disturbance increased and decreased different aspects of robustness to simulated plant extinction. Disturbance decreased the risk that an initial insect extinction would follow a plant species loss. Although, this effect disappeared when network size and connectance were standardised, suggesting the lower connectance of disturbed networks increased robustness to an initial secondary extinction. However, if a secondary extinction occurred then networks from disturbed habitat were more prone to large co-extinction cascades, likely resulting from a greater chance of extinction in these larger, speciose networks. Conversely, when species mutualism dependency was explicit in the SCM simulations the disturbed networks were disproportionately more robust to very large co-extinction cascades, potentially caused by non-random patterns of interaction between species differing in dependence on mutualism. Our results showed disturbance altered the size and the distribution of interspecific interactions in the networks to affect their robustness to co-extinction cascades. Controlling for effects due to network size and the interspecific variation in demographic dependence on mutualism can improve insight into properties conferring the structural robustness of networks to environmental changes.

To predict the geographical distributions of these species, correlative ecological niche models (ENMs) are typically used. Such methods rely on assumptions of niche conservatism, although there is increasing evidence that many species undergo niche shifts during invasions. The magnitude and direction of niche shifts, however, is likely to vary within and between taxonomic groups, highlighting that an assessment of potential niche shifts in such insects is required. Location: Global. Time period: Current. Major taxa studied: Insects. Methods: We compile a novel database of 22 globally invasive, non-native insect species and test for niche expansion and unfilling across this group. We examine if factors such as the native range size, poleward shifts and human influence may be associated with observed niche changes. Finally, we construct ENMs and examine the reliability of their predictions in light of our niche shift results. Results: Niche expansion was apparent in 12 of the 22 species, suggesting that altered species-climate relationships during invasion is common for this group. Likewise, niche unfilling occurred in 15 of the species. Increasing human disturbance (combining human population, transport networks and land use) explained 40% of observed niche expansions and 54% of incidents of niche unfilling. Niche metrics and ENM performance were sensitive to the choice of background extents. Main conclusions: Many non-native insects expand into new climates in their invasive ranges.

Non-native invasive insects tend to invade areas with similar human disturbance to their native range, and habitat accessibility appears important for these species to achieve their full invasion range potential.

However, when a conservation plan was first developed for the species, scarce information on the leopards' status existed. To illustrate regional conservation challenges, we focused on the Hunchun Nature Reserve and the surrounding area along the China-Russia border, a potential stronghold for Amur leopard conservation. We conducted large-scale data analysis with a field camera-trapping network to present the first population estimates for this species using a spatially explicit capture-recapture approach. We then used a zero-inflated regression model to analyze the relationship of leopards with major prey species and anthropogenic disturbances. Our results indicate that leopards are returning to China, but most of them are part of a border population or are transient; their numbers are far too few to establish a healthy population. The spatial counts of leopards were noticeably high in areas with high prey richness and areas far from settlements and roads. Areas with few prey species and high human and cattle use exhibited a greater probability of excess absences of leopards. Mitigating human disturbances by progressively minimizing cattle and human impacts on the forest should be pursued along with habitat expansion for large ungulates, whose presence is essential for leopard occupancy. This study provides crucial information to support Chinese government recovery efforts and for refining conservation practices in human-dominated landscapes to ensure the long-term survival of this species.

Animals migrating outside of protected areas can be exposed to greater human pressure, and this effect can be stronger when humans are perceived to be a predation risk, such as during hunting seasons. Using four consecutive years of satellite telemetry data (n = 138 migration events), we compared habitat selection, movement, and behavior of a large partially migratory herbivore while migrating through a heterogeneous landscape in spring and fall. We tested the hypothesis that fall hunting exacerbates the response of a large herbivore exposed to human disturbance while migrating through a road network. All elk (Cervus elaphus) selected greater forest cover, reduced movement rates, and avoided roads during fall-day than in any other season or time of day. Avoidance of roads was reduced during spring at night, for example, the time period of no hunting with fewest people on roads. Elk using stopovers in fall displayed different seasonal and diurnal behaviors between sexes in response to the disturbance. Females used steeper terrain during fall-day and males did not use this strategy in fall. Male avoidance of roads was much stronger than females during fall-day and males were less likely to cross a road during fall. Such responses are probably linked to higher hunting pressure on males vs. females. Finally, we found that elk spent more time feeding during spring migration compared to the fall migration and elk vigilance was > 3 times higher in the fall hunting season. Our results provide insights into the effect of fear of humans on the ecology of both sexes of a migrating large herbivore when using stopovers. Such changes in behavior and stopover use might affect animal fitness by decreasing foraging, cause displacement from high-quality habitats, or affect the permeability of migration route stopovers.",,,,"Ciuti, Simone/D-7283-2013; Boyce, Mark S/A-2620-2014","Ciuti, Simone/0000-0003-1052-9509; Boyce, Mark S/0000-0001-5811-325X",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,JUN,2017,8,6,,,,,,,e01841,10.1002/ecs2.1841,,,,,,,WOS:000405626700020,,,,,,

Through combining the automated tracking of winter flocks of over 500 wild great tits (Pants major) with removal experiments, we assessed how individuals' social network positions responded to the loss of their social associates. We found that the extent of flockmate loss that individuals experienced correlated positively with subsequent increases in the number of their social associations, the average strength of their bonds and their overall connectedness within the social network (defined as summed edge weights). Increased social connectivity was not driven by general disturbance or changes in foraging behaviour, but by modifications to fine-scale social network connections in response to losing their associates. Therefore, the reduction in social connectedness expected by individual loss may be mitigated by increases in social associations between remaining individuals. Given that these findings demonstrate rapid adjustment of social network associations in response to the loss of previous social ties, future research should examine the generality of the compensatory adjustment of social relations in ways that maintain the structure of social organization.",,,,"Croft, Darren P/B-5503-2009; Sheldon, Ben C/A-8056-2010; Crates, Ross/AAG-2161-2021","Croft, Darren P/0000-0001-6869-5097; Sheldon, Ben C/0000-0002-5240-7828; Firth, Josh/0000-0001-7183-4115; Voelkl, Bernhard/0000-0001-5454-2508",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,MAY 17,2017,284,1854,,,,,,,20170299,10.1098/rspb.2017.0299,,,,,,,WOS:000404425100007,28515203,,,,,

Using data from nearly 50,000 large dams, we assessed stream network fragmentation and flow alteration by large dams for streams of the conterminous USA. We developed 21 dam metrics characterizing a diversity of dam influences operating at both localized (e.g., distances-to-dams) and landscape scales (e.g., cumulative reservoir storage throughout stream networks) for every stream reach in the study region. We further evaluated how dams have affected stream fish assemblages within large ecoregions using more than 37,000 stream fish samples. Stream's have been severely fragmented by large dams, with the number of stream segments increasing by 801% compared to free-flowing streams in the absence of dams and a staggering 79% of stream length is disconnected from their outlet (i.e., oceans and Great Lakes). Flow alteration metrics demonstrate a landscape-scale disturbance of dams, resulting in total upstream reservoir storage volumes exceeding estimated annual discharge volumes of many of the nation's largest rivers. Further, we show large-scale changes in fish assemblages With dams. Species adapted to lentic habitats increase with dams across the conterminous USA, while rheophils, lithophils, and intolerant fishes decrease with dams.

These stressors can act together, with disturbance due to changes in land-use facilitating invasion. We examined the potential for agricultural land use to facilitate the establishment and population growth (abundance) of a globally invasive fish (Gambusia affinis). To achieve this we examined Gambusia presence, abundance, and life history traits in 31 streams spanning an agricultural land use gradient in the North Island of New Zealand. We used regression models to quantify the relationship between agricultural land use and in-stream physiochemical and habitat variables, and zero-inflated models to explore the relationship among physiochemical, habitat and catchment-scale variables and Gambusia's distribution and abundance. The percentage of the catchment in agricultural land use was associated with changes to physiochemical and habitat conditions. Increasing agricultural land use was associated with increasing macrophyte cover and water temperature and decreasing velocity in streams. Catchment-scale variables (land use and site position in the network) and water temperature were the most important determinants of whether Gambusia dccurred at a site. Local in-stream habitat (macrophyte cover and Water velocity) and nutrient conditions were the most influential predictors of Gambusia abundance given Gambusia were present. Gambusia life-history traits, sex ratio and body length varied among sites but were not predicted by physiochemical gradients. The distribution of Gambusia in streams in New Zealand is partially controlled by catchment-scale conditions via a combination of dispersal limitation and environmental filtering, both of which are affected by agricultural land use. Agricultural land use alters local in-stream conditions, resulting in systems that are similar to those in Gambusia's natural range; these altered systems have the potential to support an increased abundance of Gambusia. This study provides preliminary quantitative evidence that agricultural land use is related to the spread of a globally invasive freshwater fish. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Despite ongoing interest in the consequences of losing a keystone individual on group performance, little is known about whether other individuals with an appropriate behavioral type can readily assume the keystone role. Here, we examine if the identity of a keystone individual impacts its influence on the collective behavior of its group in a society of social spiders. We find that the repeated replacement of a keystone individual, which is typically a group's boldest constituent, has little impact on the collective prey capture of the colony. However, repeatedly replacing a shy, generic, individual in the group reduces prey capture success. Groups in which the keystone individual is repeatedly replaced increase their overall boldness, thus potentially collectively substituting the bold behavioral type that they lost. Furthermore, newly replaced keystone individuals participate in a greater proportion of prey attacks than established keystone individuals in undisturbed colonies, as seen in prior work on colony social development, suggesting that the repeated replacement of a keystone individual maintains colonies in an early stage of social succession. By uncovering the mechanisms that underlie a group's robustness to social perturbations, our work sheds light on how social dynamics dictate colony-level phenotypes in animal groups.",,,,,"Pruitt, Jonathan/0000-0003-0326-6755",,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,1465-7279,,,,MAY-JUN,2017,28,3,,,,,883,889,,10.1093/beheco/arx054,,,,,,,WOS:000401942800038,,,,,,

Despite increasing evidence that the additional noise generated by human activities can affect vocal communication, the majority of research has focused on the use of conspecific acoustic information, especially sexual signals. Many animals are known to eavesdrop on the alarm calls produced by other species, enhancing their likelihood of avoiding predation, but how this use of heterospecific information is affected by anthropogenic noise has received little empirical attention. Here, we use two field-based playback experiments on a habituated wild population of dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula) to determine how anthropogenic noise influences the response of foragers to heterospecific alarm calls. We begin by demonstrating that dwarf mongooses respond appropriately to the alarm calls of sympatric chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) and tree squirrels (Paraxerus cepapi); fleeing only to the latter. We then show that mongoose foragers are less likely to exhibit this flee response to tree squirrel alarm calls during road-noise playback compared to ambient-sound playback. One explanation for the change in response is that noise-induced distraction or stress result in maladaptive behaviour. However, further analysis revealed that road-noise playback results in increased vigilance and that mongooses showing the greatest vigilance increase are those that do not subsequently exhibit a flee response to the alarm call. These individuals may therefore be acting appropriately: if the greater gathering of personal information indicates the absence of an actual predator despite an alarm call, the need to undertake costly fleeing behaviour can be avoided. Either way, our study indicates the potential for anthropogenic noise to interfere with the use of acoustic information from other species, and suggests the importance of considering how heterospecific networks are affected by this global pollutant.

However, the restrictions that this legislation places on developers are often based on limited ecological understanding, over-simplified methodologies, less-than-robust data and the subjective interpretations of field ecologists. Consequently, constraints may be imposed with no transparent methodology behind them to the frustration of, and occasionally large expense to, developers. Additionally, protected species numbers continue to decline and biodiversity continues to be threatened. This paper describes a GIS conceptual model for assessing ecological disturbance vulnerability, based upon a case study development in Scotland. First, uncertainties in traditional methods of recording and representing ecological features with GIS are reviewed such that they may be better accounted for in the disturbance model. Second, by incorporating temporal fluctuations in ecological behaviour into the disturbance susceptibility concept, it is argued that it is possible to synchronise development with conservation requirements. Finally, a method is presented to account for disturbance tolerances at the scale of the individual animal. It is anticipated that this model will enable environmental impact assessors to produce more robust analyses of wildlife disturbance risk and facilitate synchronisation between development and wildlife vulnerability to minimise disturbance and better avoid delays to the works programme.

For mutualistic species, these changes are expected to result in altered partner availability, and shifts in context-dependent benefits for partners. To test these predictions, we assessed the network structure of terrestrial ant-plant mutualists and how the benefits to plants of ant inhabitation changed with elevation in tropical forest in Papua New Guinea. At higher elevations, ant-plants were rarer, species richness of both ants and plants decreased, and the average ant or plant species interacted with fewer partners. However, networks became increasingly connected and less specialized, more than could be accounted for by reductions in ant-plant abundance. On the most common ant-plant, ants recruited less and spent less time attacking a surrogate herbivore at higher elevations, and herbivory damage increased. These changes were driven by turnover of ant species rather than by within-species shifts in protective behaviour. We speculate that reduced partner availability at higher elevations results in less specialized networks, while lower temperatures mean that even for ant-inhabited plants, benefits are reduced.

They also are collected for the ornamental aquarium trade, but little is known about their population dynamics to support conservation management. We quantified variation in population structure among regions of the Florida Keys and levels of human impact within region. The Upper Keys and lowimpact sites supported higher population abundance and proportions of small anemones than the Lower Keys and high- impact sites. At 2 sites where we monitored anemone dynamics every 2 mo for 1 yr, individuals recruited frequently and grew rapidly to maximum body size and then re mained static or shrank. Fewer than half the individuals survived all year, indicating rapid population turnover, with mortality occurring mostly among small individuals or large ones that appeared to senesce beforehand. Stasis of large individuals (or lack thereof) exerted the most influence on population size. We conclude that in Florida, corkscrew anemones experience relatively high recruitment and survival at sites with low human impact and in the Upper Keys, where summer water temperatures are cooler than in the Lower Keys. Populations are highly dynamic and appear to rely on frequent recruitment, potentially linked to the presence of resident adults at high enough abundances for fertilization of broadcast propagules.

Individual shark catchability decreased as a function of experience, as revealed by comparing capture frequency and site presence. Altogether, these features suggest that individuals learnt to avoid capture, which ultimately increased network robustness to experimental catch-and-release.

We used a deterministic water temperature model to investigate potential thermal benefits of riparian reforestation and channel narrowing to Chinook Salmon populations in the Upper Grande Ronde River and Catherine Creek basins in Northeast Oregon, USA. A legacy of intensive land use practices in these basins has significantly reduced streamside vegetation and increased channel width across most of the stream network, resulting in water temperatures that far exceed the optimal range for salmon growth and survival. By combining restoration scenarios with climate change projections, we were able to evaluate whether future climate impacts could be offset by restoration actions. A combination of riparian restoration and channel narrowing was predicted to reduce peak summer water temperatures by 6.5 degrees C on average in the Upper Grande Ronde River and 3.0 degrees C in Catherine Creek in the absence of other perturbations. These results translated to increases in Chinook Salmon parr abundance of 590% and 67% respectively. Although projected climate change impacts on water temperature for the 2080s time period were substantial (i.e., median increase of 2.7 degrees C in the Upper Grande Ronde and 1.5 degrees C in Catherine Creek), we predicted that basin-wide restoration of riparian vegetation and channel width could offset these impacts, reducing peak summer water temperatures by about 3.5 degrees C in the Upper Grande Ronde and 1.8 degrees C in Catherine Creek. These results underscore the potential for riparian and stream channel restoration to mitigate climate change impacts to threatened salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest. (C) 2016 The Authors.

To evaluate the ecosystem dynamics within the GoM, we developed a mass balanced Ecopath model (nGoM Ecopath) which integrated ecosystem stressors, indirect effects of fishing (e.g. bycatch), and predator-prey dynamics. A meta-analysis of diet composition filled critical gaps in higher trophic level predator-prey linkages, such as predation on economically important groupers (Serranidae). Compared to previous Ecopath models of the GoM, nGoM Ecopath displayed higher ecosystem complexity including higher connectivity amongst trophic groups and increased omnivory. Mixed trophic impact analysis revealed species including snappers, groupers, pelagic coastal piscivores, oceanic piscivores, cephalopods, and dolphins as critical top-down predators. Bottom-up effects were identified for juvenile groupers and mackerels, which benefited from high production of invertebrates and small fishes. Network analysis revealed detrimental effects of red tides on sharks, skates and rays, and demersal coastal invertebrate feeders such as black drum, as well as adult red and gag grouper. Pelagic coastal piscivores (e.g. jacks (Carangidae)), snappers (Lutjanidae), and mobile epifauna (e.g. lobsters) imposed the largest influence on ecosystem structure as keystone predators. The nGoM Ecopath model using the dynamic module Ecosim can help guide restoration efforts through the evaluation of multispecies responses to management actions and identification of ecosystem trade-offs.

We used an observational approach to determine the importance of road density to kit fox space use, relative to other measured environmental variables. We monitored 22 collared individuals and used linear mixed models and an information-theoretic approach to develop models of intensity of space use for seasons of relatively low (e.g., 33% of yearly OHV use observed) and high (e.g., 67% of yearly OHV use observed) OHV use. We found road density to be the most important predictor of space use for kit foxes, relative to other measured environmental variables.

However, the insight from food web topology into dynamic effects of perturbations on species is potentially hindered because most described topologies represent data integrated across spatial and temporal scales. We conducted a 10-year, whole-lake experiment in which we removed invasive rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus) from a 64-ha north-temperate lake and monitored responses of multiple trophic levels. We compared species responses observed in two sub-habitats to the responses predicted from all topologies of an integrated, literature- informed base food web model of 32 potential links. Out of 4.3 billion possible topologies, only 308,833 (0.0072%) predicted responses that qualitatively matched observed species responses in cobble habitat, and only 12,673 (0.0003%) matched observed responses in sand habitat. Furthermore, when constrained to predictions that both matched observed responses and were highly reliable (i. e., predictions were robust to link strength values), only 5040 (0.0001%) and 140 (0.000003%) topologies were identified for cobble and sand habitats, respectively. A small number of linkages were nearly always present in these valid, reliable networks in sand, while a greater variety of possible network configurations were possible in cobble. Direct links involving invasive rusty crayfish were more important in cobble, while indirect effects involving Lepomis spp. were more important in sand. Importantly, the importance of individual species linkages differed dramatically among cobble and sand sub-habitats within a single lake, even though species composition was identical. Although the true topology of food webs is difficult to determine, constraining topologies to include spatial resolution that matches observed experimental outcomes may reduce possibilities to a small number of plausible alternatives.",,,,,"Vander Zanden, Jake/0000-0002-8122-1416; Hansen, Gretchen/0000-0003-0241-7048",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,FEB,2017,8,2,,,,,,,e01647,10.1002/ecs2.1647,,,,,,,WOS:000397091300014,,,,,,

Increased flood size could alter stream habitats used by Pacific salmon for reproduction, with negative consequences for the substantial economic, cultural, and ecosystem services these fish provide. We combined field measurements and model simulations to estimate the potential influence of future flood disturbance on geomorphic processes controlling the quality and extent of coho, chum, and pink salmon spawning habitat in over 800 southeast Alaska watersheds. Spawning habitat responses varied widely across watersheds and among salmon species. Little variation among watersheds in potential spawning habitat change was explained by predicted increases in mean annual flood size. Watershed response diversity was mediated primarily by topographic controls on stream channel confinement, reach-scale geomorphic associations with spawning habitat preferences, and complexity in the pace and mode of geomorphic channel responses to altered flood size. Potential spawning habitat loss was highest for coho salmon, which spawn over a wide range of geomorphic settings, including steeper, confined stream reaches that are more susceptible to streambed scour during high flows. We estimated that 9-10% and 13-16% of the spawning habitat for coho salmon could be lost by the 2040s and 2080s, respectively, with losses occurring primarily in confined, higher-gradient streams that provide only moderate-quality habitat. Estimated effects were lower for pink and chum salmon, which primarily spawn in unconfined floodplain streams. Our results illustrate the importance of accounting for valley and reach-scale geomorphic features in watershed assessments of climate vulnerability, especially in topographically complex regions.

These feedbacks are part of complex social-ecological systems (SES), in which resources, actors, and governance systems interact to produce outcomes across these component parts. Qualitative modeling approaches offer ways to assess complex SES dynamics. Loop analysis in particular is useful for examining and identifying potential outcomes from external perturbations and management interventions in data poor systems when very little is known about functional relationships and parameter values. Using a case study of multispecies, multifleet coastal small-scale fisheries, we demonstrate the application of loop analysis to provide predictions regarding SES responses to perturbations and management actions. Specifically, we examine the potential ecological and socioeconomic consequences to coastal fisheries of different governance interventions (e.g., territorial user rights, fisheries closures, market-based incentives, ecotourism subsidies) and environmental changes. Our results indicate that complex feedbacks among biophysical and socioeconomic components can result in counterintuitive and unexpected outcomes. For example, creating new jobs through ecotourism or subsidies might have mixed effects on members of fishing cooperatives vs. nonmembers, highlighting equity issues. Market-based interventions, such as ecolabels, are expected to have overall positive economic effects, assuming a direct effect of ecolabels on marketprices, and a lack of negative biological impacts under most model structures. Our results highlight that integrating ecological and social variables in a unique unit of management can reveal important potential trade-offs between desirable ecological and social outcomes, highlight which user groups might be more vulnerable to external shocks, and identify which interventions should be further tested to identify potential win-win outcomes across the triple-bottom line of the sustainable development paradigm.",,,,"Bodini, Antonio/B-5520-2015","Bodini, Antonio/0000-0002-3940-5430",,,,,,,,,,,,1708-3087,,,,,,2017,22,1,,,,,,,34,10.5751/ES-08825-220134,,,,,,,WOS:000399397700005,,,,,,

In freshwater systems, novel environmental conditions often result from large-scale changes to hydrological connectivity as well as species invasions. Novel environmental conditions may affect the survival of aquatic fauna by altering dispersal patterns and resource fluctuations, and/or may impose physiological constraints on native species evolutionarily adapted to particular environments. Further, novel systems can provide insight into processes driving community structure because re-sorting or filtering of regional biota is a likely consequence of decoupling from historical conditions. Although several studies document the presence of novel conditions, few examine variation or gradients in novelty. The Florida Everglades is a highly invaded and hydrologically altered system characterized by a large network of canals that compartmentalize the ecosystem and act to both increase and decrease connectivity. Little is known about how canals in this region function as habitat for native and nonnative fishes, the extent to which these canals may function as novel habitats, and how these habitat characteristics may influence distribution, abundance, and assembly patterns. In this study, we examined native and nonnative fish assemblages along a gradient of novelty, defined as the loss of wetland connectivity, influence of the natural hydrological regime, and habitat complexity (well connected to leveed canals). As novelty increased, native species richness and abundance strongly declined and the contribution of nonnatives increased to nearly 50%. Vast differences in community structure across the novelty gradient were strongly influenced by spatial factors and secondarily by hydrological factors, while habitat and abiotic factors were of very low relevance. Natives and nonnatives had opposing responses to key hydrological and habitat characteristics. Abundance of native fishes declined with decreased connectivity to adjacent marshes and canal littoral zone width, while nonnative fishes increased significantly in the most novel canals. Our results suggest that the inherent loss of natural environmental conditions and subsequent replacement by novel ones can lead to extensive changes in fish community structure. Success or failure at maintaining native assemblages will rely heavily on natural resource manager's ability to incorporate natural environmental characteristics with ecosystem restoration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,JAN,2017,8,1,,,,,,,e01634,10.1002/ecs2.1634,,,,,,,WOS:000396526300024,,,,,,

Specialization in plant-pollinator relationships is a core concept in discussions of plant evolution and ecology; it is central to our thinking, not just about the ecology of plant-pollinator interactions and pollinator services, but also about reproductive isolation, speciation, extinction and assembly of communities. However, as reviewed here, the concept ` plant-pollinator specialization' has multiple definitions and uses, and these disparate uses have engendered confusion in the literature. Organizing these disparate uses into a comprehensive framework is an overdue task, prior efforts notwithstanding. 2. This contribution attempts to make clear the variation in meaning and usage of plant-pollinator specialization, including distinguishing between ecological specialization (interacting with few partners or resources), evolutionary specialization (genetic change associated with increased specialization) and phenotypic specialization (having specialized or derived phenotypic traits), with application of all three concepts to both plants and flower-visiting animals. These variations in interpretation of specialization affect how we view evolutionary and biogeographical trends, as well as extinction risk. 3. In the light of this conceptual diversity, I evaluate the relationships between specialization and possible trends in floral evolution and rates of speciation and extinction. I also address several implications of specialization for community ecology and resilience of pollination services in the face of environmental disturbance.",,,,"Armbruster, William Scott/B-4799-2013","Armbruster, William Scott/0000-0001-8057-4116",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,JAN,2017,31,1,,,,,88,100,,10.1111/1365-2435.12783,,,,,,,WOS:000394372700011,,,,,,

Yet, we are losing species at an unprecedented rate, and this especially occurs in tropical rainforests, the biologically richest but most eroded biome on earth. Unfortunately, there is a chronic gap in standardized and pan-tropical data in tropical forests, affecting our capacity to monitor changes and anticipate future scenarios. The Tropical Ecology, Assessment and Monitoring (TEAM) Network was established to contribute addressing this issue, as it generates real time data to monitor long-term trends in tropical biodiversity and guide conservation practice. We present the Network and focus primarily on the Terrestrial Vertebrates protocol, that uses systematic camera trapping to detect forest mammals and birds, and secondarily on the Zone of Interaction protocol, that measures changes in the anthroposphere around the core monitoring area. With over 3 million images so far recorded, and managed using advanced information technology, TEAM has created the most important data set on tropical forest mammals globally. We provide examples of site-specific and global analyses that, combined with data on anthropogenic disturbance collected in the larger ecosystem where monitoring sites are, allowed us to understand the drivers of changes of target species and communities in space and time. We discuss the potential of this system as a candidate model towards setting up an early warning system that can effectively anticipate changes in coupled human-natural system, trigger management actions, and hence decrease the gap between research and management responses. In turn, TEAM produces robust biodiversity indicators that meet the requirements set by global policies such as the Aichi Biodiversity Targets.

However, evolvability has not yet been studied and also there is still no relevant notion of forest health. This calls for a biodynamic approach to forests and clearly addresses questions relating to scaling and self-organisation since the different levels of detail must be compatible to ensure the consistency of sustainability and diversity assessments. To support the development of a biodynamic approach to forests we review the concepts of self-organisation, criticality and resilience, and their relationship to forest integrity in the light of fractal organisation theory. An exploration of fractal connectivity behind key bioindicators and biomonitors in the avoidance of a biodiversity threshold can be suggested thus far. Forest integrity refers to empirical scaling relationships that are emergent features of biodiversity.

Currently no integrated, ecosystem-based study on the effects of the construction and exploitation of offshore wind farms exists, where biological approaches generally focused on the conservation of some valuable species or groups of species. Complementary trophic web modelling tools were applied to the Bay of Seine ecosystem (to the 50 km(2) area covered by the wind farm) to analyse the potential impacts of benthos and fish aggregation caused by the introduction of additional hard substrates from the piles and the turbine scour protections. An Ecopath ecosystem model composed of 37 compartments, from phytoplankton to seabirds, was built to describe the situation before the construction of the wind farm. Then, an Ecosim projection over 30 years was performed after increasing the biomass of targeted benthic and fish compartments.

Assessing the vulnerability of forest dependent species, however, hinges on quantifying microclimates that exist below the forest canopy and might be influenced by varying levels of disturbance in human-modified landscapes. The goal of our study was to examine the multi-scaled predictors of subcanopy microclimate variability across a heterogeneous landscape in Midwestern USA during winter, and to further evaluate whether a widely available interpolated climate model accurately captures this variability. By deploying a network of temperature sensors along a fragmentation gradient, we found that forests in more fragmented landscapes with greater amounts of forest edge and increasing distances between forest patches, experienced colder minimum and average daily temperatures throughout the winter than forests in less fragmented landscapes. We found that greater tree densities and higher elevations led to warmer microclimates while increasing distances from urban centers led to colder microclimates. The negative effect of forest edge on minimum temperatures was lessened by the effect of increasing basal area, highlighting the importance of local-and landscape-scale features on microclimate heterogeneity. Temperature discrepancies between subcanopy microclimates and climate interpolations were influenced by many of the same features, and could be of a similar magnitude as those predicted by future climate change scenarios. Using a biological threshold based on metabolic and demographic constraints for winter birds, we found that the variability in microclimates along our forest fragmentation gradient (50 km) was comparable to the magnitude captured by weather stations across a latitudinal gradient spanning more than 650 km. Our results suggest that biophysical properties of landscapes can alter spatial gradients of microclimates and should be considered when assessing species' vulnerabilities to future climate change.",,,,"Zuckerberg, Benjamin/AAL-9623-2021","Latimer, Christopher/0000-0003-0063-7506",,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,1600-0587,,,,JAN,2017,40,1,,,,,158,170,,10.1111/ecog.02551,,,,,,,WOS:000394670600014,,,,,,

Some of the analyses made to compare the fishing activity and management measures carried out in the North East Atlantic and in the Mediterranean do not take into account some of the differentiating peculiarities of each of these regions. At the same time, they resort to traditional fisheries management measures and do not discuss the role of marine protected areas as a complementary management tool. In this respect, the apparent failure of marine protected areas in the North-East Atlantic compared with the same in the Mediterranean is challenging European fishery scientists. Application of the classical holistic view of ecological succession to the functioning of fishery closures and no-use areas highlights the importance of combining both management regimes to fully satisfy both fishery- and biodiversity-oriented goals. We advocate that an optimal management strategy for designing an MPA to protect biodiversity and sustain fishing yields consists of combining a network of no-use areas (close to their mature state) with fish boxes (buffer zones maintained by fishing disturbance in a relatively early successional stage, where productivity is higher), under a multi-zoning scheme. In this framework, the importance of no-use areas for fisheries is based on several observations: (1) They preserve biological diversity at regional scale, at all levels specific, habitat/seascape, and also genetic diversity and the structure of populations, allowing natural selection to operate. (2) They permit the natural variability of the system to be differentiated from the effects of regulation and to be integrated in appropriate sampling schemes as controls.

Here, we use the functional trait structure of Amazonian forest bird assemblages to explore the impacts of land-cover change on two ecosystem processes: seed dispersal and insect predation. We show that trait structure in assemblages of frugivorous and insectivorous birds remained stable after primary forests were subjected to logging and fire events, but that further intensification of human land use substantially reduced the functional diversity and dispersion of traits, and resulted in communities that occupied a different region of trait space. These effects were only partially reversed in regenerating secondary forests. Our findings suggest that local extinctions caused by the loss and degradation of tropical forest are non-random with respect to functional traits, thus disrupting the network of trophic interactions regulating seed dispersal by forest birds and herbivory by insects, with important implications for the structure and resilience of human-modified tropical forests. Furthermore, our results illustrate how quantitative functional traits for specific guilds can provide a range of metrics for estimating the contribution of biodiversity to ecosystem processes, and the response of such processes to land-cover change.",,,,"Aleixo, Alexandre/L-3135-2013; Lees, Alexander Charles/S-2443-2019; Barlow, Jos/E-7861-2014","Aleixo, Alexandre/0000-0002-7816-9725; Lees, Alexander Charles/0000-0001-7603-9081; Tobias, Joseph/0000-0003-2429-6179",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,DEC 14,2016,283,1844,,,,,,,20161289,10.1098/rspb.2016.1289,,,,,,,WOS:000390404200006,,,,,,

We quantified the effects of military training on vertebrates in a 5-year study at Beecroft Weapons Range in south-eastern Australia by contrasting the occurrence of birds, mammals and reptiles between 24 sites within an area subject to repeated weapons use and a matched set of non-impacted sites. Species richness of mammals and reptiles was similar within versus outside the impact area, although many-individual species responded to fire, which occurred more frequently in impacted sites. Bird species richness, the occurrence of larger-bodied and migratory bird species, and the occurrence of most individual bird species, was reduced within the impact area. Many bird species that displayed low prevalence in impacted sites also declined over time across the whole study area. Differences in biota between the impact and non-impact areas were detectable after controlling for the effects of recent fire, suggesting that weapons use impacted vertebrates through mechanisms additional to altered fire regimes. Overall, our data indicated that Beecroft Weapons Range maintained considerable biodiversity value despite prolonged military use. Hence, MTAs have the potential to make a substantial contribution to conservation outside the formal protected area network. However, managers of MTAs need to explicitly state their environmental objectives. This is because management practices may be different if the aim is to maximize species richness rather than to secure populations of particular species.

The resulting trophic model was used to determine the macroscopic (emergent) properties, overall health and propagation of dynamical higher order effects within this complex Antarctic ecological system in response to simulated impacts. The magnitude of the Relative Ascendency, Relative Overhead, and Redundancy values indicates that the coastal benthic/pelagic Fildes Bay system is likely to remain less developed and therefore more resistant to perturbations than other ecological systems dominated by brown macroalgae. In terms of model component contributions to the Ascendency, detritus accounted for similar to 33% of the value, followed by the phyto-zooplankton complex (similar to 26%), macroalgae (similar to 19%), filter-feeders (similar to 7%), small epifauna (5%), and top predators (2%). Short-term or transient Ecosim dynamical responses to increase the total mortality of each model component-given mixed and top-down vulnerabilities-revealed that changes in macroalgae levels had a limited impact on the other components of the system. The filter feeder, small epifauna and benthic fishe's functional groups had the greatest effects on the remaining Fildes Bay system components. The magnitude of the System Recovery Time indicated that the Nacella concinna and small epifauna components would take the longest time to return to their initial state. Based on the outcomes obtained from the model, we suggest that this preliminary trophic model, including simulated impacts, provides promising possibilities for the determination of macroscopic baseline conditions and the most sensitive components of the Fildes Bay ecological system.

However, species co-occurrence can vary over time. Here we demonstrate how temporal dynamics in species co-occurrence influence the ability of managers to choose the best surrogate species. We develop an efficient optimisation formulation that selects the optimal set of complementary surrogate species from any co-occurrence network. We apply it to two Australian datasets on successional bird responses to disturbances of revegetation and fire. We discover that a surprisingly small number of species are required to represent the majority of species co-occurrences at any one time. Because co-occurrence patterns are temporally dynamic, the optimal set of surrogates, and the number of surrogates required to achieve a desired surrogacy power, depend on sampling effort and the successional state of a system. Overlap in optimal sets of surrogates for representing 70% of co-occurring species ranges from zero to 57% depending on when the surrogacy decision is made. Surrogate sets representing early successional communities over-estimate the power of surrogacy decisions at later times. Our results show that in dynamic systems, optimal surrogates might be selected in different ways: 1) use short-term monitoring to choose a larger number of static less-informative surrogates; 2) use long-term monitoring to choose a smaller number of static high-power surrogates that may poorly represent early successional co-occurrence; 3) develop adaptive surrogate selection frameworks with high short-term and long-term surrogacy power that update surrogate sets and capture temporal dynamics in species co-occurrence. Our results suggest vigilance is needed when selecting surrogates for other co-occurring species in dynamic landscapes, as selected surrogates from one time may have reduced effectiveness at a different time.

J,"O'Neill, BJ",,,,"O'Neill, Brian J.",,,Community disassembly in ephemeral ecosystems,ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Community disassembly is the non-random process of progressive species declines and losses. This process is usually studied to determine how various forces extirpate species, such as catastrophic disturbance, species invasions, habitat fragmentation, or unnatural/anthropogenic stressors. However, in ephemeral ecosystems, community disassembly is a natural and repeatable process. While many ephemeral ecosystems are aquatic (vernal pools, playa lakes, rock pools, saline lakes, phytotelmata, etc.), some disassembly patterns are applicable to other ecosystem types, including terrestrial ecosystems. As ephemeral waterbodies near the end of their hydroperiod, certain aspects fundamentally change. These fundamental changes or mechanisms cause visible patterns of community disassembly. Decreasing habitat size eliminates microhabitats and increases encounter rates between organisms, possibly increasing predation and competition. A harshening habitat eliminates low-tolerance species, changes the proportions of specialists/generalists, and forces organisms to acclimate, emigrate, or die. Additionally, ultraviolet light affects more of the water column, eliminating unprotected species. Furthermore, the entire metacommunity is often in similar stages of disassembly and collapses. Many of these mechanisms drive disassembly of terrestrial ephemeral habitats, such as animal carcasses, dung pads, or fungal fruiting bodies. Organisms obligate to ephemeral habitats have evolved to optimize their life history for a rapid life cycle with specific adaptations for themselves or their offspring to survive through the inactive period of the ecosystem. While some disassembly may occur too fast for biotic interactions or compensatory dynamics to be important, organisms undergoing natural disassembly should expect it. Thus, predictions of disassembly based on internal or biotic patterns may be more common in natural disassembly scenarios than in human-induced disassembly of permanent ecosystems. Additionally, natural community disassembly should be more predictable and understandable than a permanent community's reaction to a never-before-seen anthropogenic disturbance. Community disassembly is an important ecological component of ephemeral ecosystems. The processes that occur during disassembly shape assemblages over ecologically and evolutionary relevant timescales. Understanding how natural disassembly can feed back to ultimately drive ecosystem structure and function increases our knowledge of fundamental ecology and provides for a new frontier of study.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,DEC,2016,97,12,,,,,3285,3292,,10.1002/ecy.1604,,,,,,,WOS:000389444800005,27861768,,,,,

Their thin external shell is sensitive to small changes in pH, and shell dissolution has already been observed in areas where aragonite saturation state is similar to 1. A decline in pteropod abundance has the potential to disrupt trophic networks and directly impact commercial fisheries. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how pteropods will be affected by global environmental change, particularly ocean acidification. In this study, physiological and molecular approaches were used to investigate the response of the Mediterranean pteropod, Heliconoides inflatus, to pH values projected for 2100 under a moderate emissions trajectory (RCP6.0). Pteropods were subjected to pH(T) 7.9 for 3days, and gene expression levels, calcification and respiration rates were measured relative to pH(T) 8.1 controls. Gross calcification decreased markedly under low pH conditions, while genes potentially involved in calcification were up-regulated, reflecting the inability of pteropods to maintain calcification rates. Gene expression data imply that under low pH conditions, both metabolic processes and protein synthesis may be compromised, while genes involved in acid-base regulation were up-regulated. A large number of genes related to nervous system structure and function were also up-regulated in the low pH treatment, including a GABA(A) receptor subunit. This observation is particularly interesting because GABA(A) receptor disturbances, leading to altered behavior, have been documented in several other marine animals after exposure to elevated CO2. The up-regulation of many genes involved in nervous system function suggests that exposure to low pH could have major effects on pteropod behavior. This study illustrates the power of combining physiological and molecular approaches. It also reveals the importance of behavioral analyses in studies aimed at understanding the impacts of low pH on marine animals.",,,,"Torda, Gergely/ABE-6388-2020; Munday, Philip L/F-5443-2011; Gattuso, Jean-Pierre/AAG-8643-2019; Torda, Gergely/ABE-6400-2020; Ong, Jue Sheng/B-3595-2018; Kamel, Bishoy/H-6166-2019; Watson, Sue-Ann/C-3172-2013; Moya, Aurelie/E-9948-2011","Munday, Philip L/0000-0001-9725-2498; Gattuso, Jean-Pierre/0000-0002-4533-4114; Torda, Gergely/0000-0002-4585-3045; Ong, Jue Sheng/0000-0002-6062-710X; Kamel, Bishoy/0000-0003-2934-3827; Lacoue-Labarthe, Thomas/0000-0002-4682-8730; Watson, Sue-Ann/0000-0002-9818-7429; Moya, Aurelie/0000-0002-8776-4710; Miller, David/0000-0003-0291-9531; Bijma, Jelle/0000-0003-4371-1438",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,DEC,2016,22,12,,,,,3888,3900,,10.1111/gcb.13350,,,,,,,WOS:000387813300006,27279327,,,,,

However, these three factors are seldom evaluated together. Here, we study the influence of climate, the distribution of deciduous forests and Pleistocene climate changes on the species diversity of Carabus ground beetles in Europe. Location Continental Europe. Methods We used geographically weighted regressions ( GWR) to explore geographical variation in the relationship between species richness and current climate in a spatially explicit context. Further, we analysed simultaneously the network of relationships among current temperature, climatic variability since the Last Glacial Maximum ( LGM) and the distribution of deciduous forests through structural equation models ( SEM). Also, we assessed dissimilarity in the composition of European faunas by means of beta diversity metrics related with true spatial replacement and nestedness. Results We find that Carabus richness patterns are, at least in part, influenced by water-energy dynamics. However, the effects of current climate are also shaped by Pleistocene glaciations, as water and energy variables change in importance at the southern limits of the ice sheet during the LGM. Accordingly, this border results in abrupt shifts in the relative importance of both ( 1) current and past climate correlates on Carabus richness, and ( 2) nestedness and true turnover on the compositional changes among their assemblages. Moreover, we also detect a direct effect of the geographical distribution of deciduous forests on Carabus species richness in both northern and southern regions. Main conclusions Our results confirm that the processes shaping diversity patterns may depend on the history of particular regions. While Carabus richness seems to be largely driven by current climate in southern Europe, in the north it appears to be more affected by the imprint of past climates.

Identification of reference sites often relies heavily on professional judgment, resulting in varying and unrepeatable methods. Standardized methods for data collection, site characterization, and reference site selection facilitate greater cooperation among assessment programs and development of assessment tools that are readily shareable and comparable. We illustrate an example that can serve the broader global monitoring community on how to create a consistent and transparent reference network for multiple stream resource agencies. We provide a case study that offers a simple example of how reference sites can be used, at the landscape level, to link upslope management practices to a specific in-channel response. We found management practices, particularly areas with high road densities, have more fine sediments than areas with fewer roads. While this example uses data from only one of the partner agencies, if data were collected in a similar manner they can be combined and create a larger, more robust dataset.

Although multiple studies have been performed using animal models, they have limited value in predicting effects on humans due to the unknown species-specific toxicological effects. To test whether exposure to low doses of TCE induces developmental toxicity in humans, we investigated the effect of TCE on human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and cardiomyocytes (derived from the hESCs). In the current study, hESCs cardiac differentiation was achieved by using differentiation medium consisting of StemPro-34. We examined the effects of TCE on cell viability by cell growth assay and cardiac inhibition by analysis of spontaneously beating cluster. The expression levels of genes associated with cardiac differentiation and Ca2+ channel pathways were measured by immunofluorescence and qPCR. The overall data indicated the following: (1) significant cardiac inhibition, which was characterized by decreased beating clusters and beating rates, following treatment with low doses of TCE; (2) significant up-regulation of the Nkx2.5/Hand1 gene in cardiac progenitors and down regulation of the Mhc-7/cTnT gene in cardiac cells; and (3) significant interference with Ca2+ channel pathways in cardiomyocytes, which contributes to the adverse effect of TCE on cardiac differentiation during early embryo development. Our results confirmed the involvement of Ca2+ turnover network in TCE cardiotoxicity as reported in animal models, while the inhibition effect of TCE on the transition of cardiac progenitors to cardiomyocytes is unique to hESCs, indicating a species-specific effect of TCE on heart development. This study provides new insight into TCE biology in humans, which may help explain the development of congenital heart defects after TCE exposure.

Press disturbances often disproportionately impact one or a few species, but these impacts invariably propagate to the remaining species in the food web. Additionally, the way species interact with each other within the food web influences the impact they have on the rest of the food web if it is disturbed. Here, we investigate the effect of species-level press disturbances in a large set of model food webs. We simulated disturbances as a reduction in growth rate of a single species within the food web, which is analogous to a targeted disturbance such as selective fishing. In these simulations, we were particularly interested in the resistance of the food web-the magnitude of disturbance it could tolerate before any species went extinct. We found that more highly connected and biodiverse food webs had lower resistance and were more likely to lose species at a low level of disturbance than sparsely connected food webs with few species. Food-web complexity also influenced which species were likely to go extinct due to the disturbance. At low species richness and/or low connectance, food webs could tolerate a large disturbance, and it was usually the focal species which went extinct. In contrast, webs were less stable at higher levels of complexity and a small disturbance rapidly propagated and caused the extinction of a non-focal species. Lastly, the disturbed species' traits were also important: Disturbance of a species with few interactions usually resulted in its own extinction, while disturbance of a species with many interactions more often caused the extinction of the disturbed species' predator(s). Likewise, the trophic level of the disturbed species influenced which species went extinct, although this was modulated by the complexity of the food web. Overall, our study indicates that both the traits of disturbed species and the complexity of the food web need to be considered in attempts to predict or manage the ecological impact of press disturbances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,NOV,2016,7,11,,,,,,,e01518,10.1002/ecs2.1518,,,,,,,WOS:000387217700001,,,,,,

However, they can be at least partially influenced by asocial factors such as the spatiotemporal opportunities for individuals to interact. We explored the social patterns of the largest population of Guiana dolphins-from dyadic interactions to the large-scale structure of their social network-considering their use of space and demographic changes during 6 years. We found that their society displays fission-fusion dynamics, characterized mainly by brief associations among individuals, and is weakly structured into four social modules. Spatial use and temporal demographic changes had minor effects on the patterns of associations among individuals. This suggests that the social modules unlikely represented spatiotemporal aggregations of individuals due to resource availability but rather involved social preferences among individuals. We show that Guiana dolphins can form social modules even in a large population with high ranging overlap and few demographic changes over time, although these social boundaries are blurred by the dynamic nature of the social relationships. Our findings illustrate and support the recent claims for the need of taking asocial processes in account when studying social structure of any animal species. Animal social relationships are dynamic, usually reflecting group living trade-offs. Simultaneously, they are influenced by the opportunities individuals have to interact. Group membership-co-occurrence in the same space and time-is the most used proxy for describing animal social relationships. Therefore, if the spatiotemporal context is not accounted for, the resultant social structure can be misrepresented. Here, we explore the social patterns of Guiana dolphins explicitly accounting for space use and temporal demographic changes. We show the largest population of Guiana dolphins displays fission-fusion dynamics, while it is structured into four distinctive sets of individuals. By accounting for asocial processes, we suggest such social modules were unlikely to result from unequal opportunities to interact but rather involved social preferences among individuals.

Results of a seven-year survey at Nafferton in northern England, with recording from all crops in an organic rotation and from three types of field boundary, indicated that the lack of field boundary management had the greatest influence on ground beetle activity/density in this particular agroecosystem. However, within the crop rotation, grass/clover limited activity/density compared with that in cereal, potato and bean crops and there were also differences within cereal crops. Data from a 17-year survey at Drayton Environmental Change Network (ECN) site in midland England indicate that previous understanding of ground beetle activity and distribution in intensively managed landscapes may have been limited by temporal constraints. At Drayton, changes in surrounding crop cover, with the introduction of willow coppice and reduced area of arable land and agricultural inputs, considerably influenced ground beetle activity/density and assemblages in non-crop habitat. Small, active species dominating the assemblage in the first few years of the Drayton survey were gradually replaced by larger, non-flying species, especially after all the willow coppice had been planted. In both surveys, activity/density of ground beetles was related to disturbance, affecting vegetation cover and structure, but at the field scale at Nafferton and at the farm scale at Drayton. Longer surveys in a variety of landscapes such as those by the United Kingdom Environmental Change Network are likely to improve understanding of activity, diversity and distribution of invertebrates, which are fundamental requirements if predators such as ground beetles are required for ecosystem service provision.

Understanding the agents of change, where they occur, and how much of the landscape they are affecting will assist resource managers in making difficult decisions. To fulfill this goal, the National Park Service implemented a long-term monitoring program to quantify landscape dynamics across 1.5 million ha within and adjacent to eight national parks in the Upper Midwest United States using an automated satellite-based change detection program called LandTrendr (Landsat-based detection of trends in disturbance and recovery). The disturbance agents detected inside parks included beaver, blowdown, development, fire, flooding, insect/disease, and forest harvest. Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore had the largest percentage of area affected inside a park (11.83%, 1.96% per yr), and Isle Royal National Park had the lowest percentage of land affected (0.03%, 0.05% per yr). Tree defoliation due to insect/disease affected the largest percentage of land inside parks (1.56%, or 0.26% per yr) but did not result in tree mortality. Adjacent to parks, disturbance agents detected included agriculture, beaver, blowdown, development, insect/disease, fire, flooding, and forest harvest. Lands adjacent to Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore experienced the highest rate of disturbance (8.75%, 1.45% per yr), largely due to forest harvests. The lands adjacent to the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area experienced the lowest percentage of change (0.62%, 0.10% per yr), with development activities being responsible for most of the change. Forest harvesting was the major change agent outside six of the eight parks, an indication of how important the wood products industry is in the region and the level to which this region is forested.

Across their range, tiger (Panthera tigris) populations occur in small fragmented patches of habitat, often isolated by large distances in human-dominated landscapes. We assessed connectivity between 16 protected areas (PAs) in central India, a global priority landscape for tiger conservation, using data on land use and land cover, human population density, and transportation infrastructure. We identified and prioritized movement routes using a combination of least-cost corridor modeling and circuit theory. Our analyses suggest that there are several opportunities to maintain connectivity in this landscape. We mapped a total of thirty-five linkages in the region and calculated metrics to estimate their quality and importance. The highest quality linkages as measured by the ratio of cost-weighted distance to Euclidean distance are Kanha-Phen/Bandhavgarh-SanjayGhasidas/Melghat-Satpura, and cost-weighted distance to least-cost path length are Nawegaon-Tadoba/Achanakmar-SanjayGhasidas/Kanha-Phen. We used current flow centrality to evaluate the contribution of each PA and linkage toward facilitating animal movement. Values are highest for Kanha and Pench tiger reserves, and the linkages between Kanha-Phen, Kanha-Pench, and Pench-Satpura, suggesting that these PAs and linkages play a critical role in maintaining connectivity in central India. In addition, smaller areas such as Bor, Nawegaon, and Phen have high centrality scores relative to their areas and thus may act as important stepping stones. We mapped pinch points, which are sections of the linkages where tiger movement is restricted due to unfavorable habitat, transportation networks, human habitation, or a combination of factors. Currently, very limited data exist on tiger movement outside of PAs to validate model results.

Patterns and relationships were evaluated spatially among sites and temporally within sites during non-drought and drought periods in tallgrass prairie streams of eastern Kansas, U.S.A. Supra-seasonal drought during 2011-2013 resulted in complete or partial drying of some sites and provided an opportunity to evaluate whether commonness was predictive of rather than predicted by colonisation and extinction. Abundance was used to predict re-colonisation in desiccated reaches and persistence in drying pools. Few species were common, while most were rare regardless of drought, and nestedness drove community dissimilarity across sites. Common species had higher colonisation and lower extinction than rarer species, but physiological tolerance was unrelated to commonness. Abundant species were generally the first to re-colonise desiccated reaches, but pre-drought abundance did not predict persistence in partially desiccated reaches. Although common species were the first to colonise and the last to go extinct, we were unable to determine whether commonness was predictive of rather than predicted by colonisation and extinction.

Yet, the responses of local communities and metacommunities in these biodiversity hotspots may differ from what is reported in other areas. We addressed the effect of drying events on local and regional fish and macroinvertebrate communities in the headwaters of the Chipiriri River basin, in the wet Neotropical piedmont of Bolivia. According to current knowledge in intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) ecology, we predicted that intermittent (INT) sites would harbour lower -diversity, but higher -diversity, than perennial (PER) sites, due to local, negative effect of drying combined with the existence of multiple recovery stages at the network scale. Although habitat variables were similar between INT and PER sites, local and regional diversity patterns differed. Local invertebrate communities were not different between site types as soon as 4-6weeks after flow resumption. The proximity of colonist sources and frequent rainfall probably enhanced persistence through dry periods and high resilience. In contrast, fish communities were still poorer at INT than PER sites, indicating they were still in the process of recolonising upstream INT reaches. -diversity analyses confirmed that invertebrate and fish metacommunities were not at the same recovery stage because (i) -diversity of invertebrates was best explained by physical and environmental distances at both INT and PER sites, whereas that of fish was explained only by physical distances at INT sites; (ii) fish -diversity was higher at INT than at PER sites, but invertebrate -diversity was similar; and (iii) physical distances were correlated with the turnover component of invertebrate -diversity but with the nestedness component for fish.

Refuges also serve as focal sites for social interactions, including mating, courtship, and aggression. Knowledge of refuge use patterns can therefore provide information about social structure, mating, and foraging success, as well as the robustness and health of wildlife populations, especially for species considered to be relatively solitary. In this study, we construct networks of burrow use to infer social associations in a threatened wildlife species typically considered solitary-the desert tortoise. We show that tortoise social networks are significantly different than null networks of random associations, and have moderate spatial constraints. We next use statistical models to identify major mechanisms behind individual-level variation in tortoise burrow use, popularity of burrows in desert tortoise habitat, and test for stressor-driven changes in refuge use patterns. We show that seasonal variation has a strong impact on tortoise burrow switching behavior. On the other hand, burrow age and topographical condition influence the number of tortoises visiting a burrow in desert tortoise habitat. Of three major population stressors affecting this species (translocation, drought, disease), translocation alters tortoise burrow switching behavior, with translocated animals visiting fewer unique burrows than residents. In a species that is not social, our study highlights the importance of leveraging refuge use behavior to study the presence of and mechanisms behind non-random social structure and individual-level variation. Our analysis of the impact of stressors on refuge-based social structure further emphasizes the potential of this method to detect environmental or anthropogenic disturbances. Adaptive and social behavior that affects fitness is now being increasingly incorporated in the conservation and management of wildlife species. However, direct observations of social interactions in species considered to be solitary are difficult, and therefore integration of behavior in conservation and management decisions in such species has been infrequent. For such species, we propose quantifying refuge use behavior as it can provide insights towards their (hidden) social structure, establish relevant contact patterns of infectious disease spread, and provide early warning signals of population stressors. Our study highlights this approach in a long-lived and threatened species, the desert tortoise. We provide evidence toward the presence of and identify mechanisms behind the social structure in desert tortoises formed by their burrow use preferences.

The diversity, spatial arrangement, temporal turnover and connectivity of these habitats are controlled by the magnitude, frequency, duration and extent of drying and rewetting events, which maintain habitat heterogeneity and control biodiversity and biogeochemical processes in intermittent rivers. We consider intermittent rivers as spatiotemporal landscape mosaics to identify the implications such a view has for empirical and theoretical developments in landscape and river ecology. Using observational data of flow states collected by citizen scientists along 1400km of river channels in western France, we used landscape metrics and ecologically scaled indices for four hypothetical, aquatic species (two fish and two insects) to describe the dynamics of intermittent river mosaics for five catchments. Dry patches dominated most observation dates but flowing patches had the longest average length and occupied the greatest proportion of channel length. At the start of each summer, catchments were almost entirely composed of flowing patches but lentic and dry patches could represented up to 80% of the catchments as summer progressed. Patch dynamics were typified by high levels of spatiotemporal variability. In contrast, ecologically scaled indices did not vary greatly among catchments within species. The ecologically scaled indices representing small fish were the most affected by habitat fragmentation. Such a landscape perspective could affect understanding of biodiversity patterns and biogeochemical processes in intermittent rivers.

While most studies highlight their negative effects, the potential for native species to increase in abundance near roads has been underappreciated, and the demographic mechanisms underlying abundance changes remain unclear. Elucidating these mechanisms requires first determining how demographic vital rates and life-history stages interact to influence population growth. One can then assess how roads alter the relative importance of the alternative demographic pathways - increased performance of early vs. late life stages - suggested as the principal drivers of increased population growth. We parameterized demographic models with 3years of census data and conducted perturbation analyses to evaluate how proximity to roads altered abundance and demography. To do so, we used the leaf-cutter ant Atta laevigata as our model organism. Leaf-cutters are native ecosystem engineers and dominant herbivores in Neotropical ecosystems and also amongst the longest lived insects in nature. Our study was conducted in Cerrado savannahs, where road networks are rapidly expanding and Atta species are major agricultural pests. We found that 35-45% of adult colonies were located within 15m of roads, which is significantly closer than expected at random. Population growth rates () were >1 both near and far from roads, but near roads were significantly (41%) higher. Elasticities of to early survival and growth rates were proportionally much higher than those of adult stages, irrespective of habitat. Life-table response experiment results indicate that the higher near roads was due primarily to the much higher colonization and early-life performance there.Synthesis and applications. Road networks are proliferating throughout biodiversity-rich regions. Developing conservation and management guidelines for species whose abundance is altered by roads requires understanding the demographic mechanisms that underpin these changes. We demonstrate that the higher growth rate of roadside Atta laevigata populations is due to increased early-life performance. Thus, the expansion of road networks could have major ecological and economic consequences by facilitating the increased abundance of ecosystem engineers and agricultural pests. Accounting for A.laevigata early life stages and careful planning of road placement should improve management strategies of protected areas and agricultural systems in Neotropical savannahs.",,,,"Bruna, Emilio M/H-2769-2012; Vasconcelos, Heraldo L/C-3353-2013","Bruna, Emilio M/0000-0003-3381-8477; Vasconcelos, Heraldo L/0000-0001-6969-7131; /0000-0002-6557-7252",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,AUG,2016,53,4,,,,,983,992,,10.1111/1365-2664.12651,,,,,,,WOS:000380065600003,,,,,,

The high number of species and lack of basic ecological knowledge provide a major obstacle to understanding the effects of environmental change. We assessed the impact of dam closure on the fish communities of a neotropical river by applying simple descriptions of community organizations: species abundance distribution and abundance biomass comparison curves. Fish data were collected using gillnets during three distinct time periods (1 year before, 1 year after and 5 years after dam closure), at eight sites located downstream of the dam, in the reservoir, transition zone and upstream. A total of 69 343 individuals representing 260 species were recorded. Dam closure was associated with changes in the organization of fish communities at all sites. Species richness tended to increase immediately after dam closure while evenness decreased. Changes in taxonomic structure (richness and evenness) were accompanied by a change in the distribution of biomass with the proportionate contribution by smaller individuals significantly increased relative to larger individuals. Five years on, richness had fallen to below pre-closure levels at all sites, while the comparative stability of assemblages in the transformed habitats was reflected by biomass-abundance distribution patterns that approximated pre-disturbance ratios. This simplistic analysis provided a sensitive and informative assessment of ecological conditions, which highlights the impact to ecosystem process and ecological networks and has particular value in regions where a lack of detailed ecological knowledge precludes the application of traditional bioassessment methods.

Much of the theoretical and mathematical development of the metacommunity concept has been based on simplified experimental systems or simulated data. We still have limited understanding of how variation in the habitat matrix and species-specific differences in dispersal ability contribute to metacommunity dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes. We model a metacommunity of rainforest mammals in Borneo, a tropical biodiversity hotspot, where protected areas are increasingly isolated by ongoing habitat disturbance and loss. We employ a combination of hierarchical models of local abundance, circuit-theory-based dispersal analysis, and metapopulation models. Our goal was to understand which landscape links were the most important to metapopulation persistence and metacommunity stability. Links were particularly important if they were short and connected two large patches. This was partly because only the very shortest links could be traversed by poorly dispersing species, including small herbivores such as chevrotains (Tragulus spp.) and porcupines. Links that join large patches into a super-patch may also promote island-mainland rather than Levins-type metapopulation dynamics for good dispersers, particularly large carnivores such as clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi) and sun bears (Helarctos malayanus), reducing metapopulation extinction risk and thereby enhancing metacommunity stability. Link importance to metacommunity stability was highly correlated between heterogeneous and homogeneous landscapes. But link importance to metapopulation capacity varied strongly across species, and the correlation between heterogeneous and homogeneous landscape matrix scenarios was low for poorly dispersing taxa. This suggests that the environmental conditions in the area between habitat patches, the landscape matrix, is important for assessing certain individual species but less so for understanding the stability of the entire metacommunity.",,,,"Mohd-Azlan, Jayasilan/AAJ-7304-2020","Mohd-Azlan, Jayasilan/0000-0001-5513-6237; Schnell, Jessica/0000-0002-6636-1162",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JUL,2016,97,7,,,,,1658,1667,,10.1890/15-1613.1,,,,,,,WOS:000379323800004,27859156,,,,,

The capacity to forecast how species respond to such press perturbations is limited by our imprecise knowledge of pairwise species interaction strengths and the many direct and indirect pathways along which perturbations can propagate between species. Network complexity (size and connectance) has thereby been seen to limit the predictability of ecological systems. Here we demonstrate a counteracting mechanism in which the influence of indirect effects declines with increasing network complexity when species interactions are governed by universal allometric constraints. With these constraints, network size and connectance interact to produce a skewed distribution of interaction strengths whose skew becomes more pronounced with increasing complexity. Together, the increased prevalence of weak interactions and the increased relative strength and rarity of strong interactions in complex networks limit disturbance propagation and preserve the qualitative predictability of net effects even when pairwise interaction strengths exhibit substantial variation or uncertainty.",,,,"Novak, Mark/E-2194-2012","Novak, Mark/0000-0002-7881-4253",,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,JUL,2016,188,1,,,,,87,98,,10.1086/686730,,,,,,,WOS:000378294900010,27322124,,,,,

They are often also central to downscaling coarse resolution climate simulations from General Circulation Models (GCMs) to project future climate scenarios at ecologically relevant spatial scales. Uncertainty in these baseline data can be large, particularly where weather observations are sparse and climate dynamics are complex (e.g. over mountainous or coastal regions). Yet, importantly, this uncertainty is almost universally overlooked when assessing potential responses of species to climate change. Here, we assessed the importance of historic baseline climate uncertainty for projections of species' responses to future climate change. We built species distribution models (SDMs) for 895 African bird species of conservation concern, using six different climate baselines. We projected these models to two future periods (2040-2069, 2070-2099), using downscaled climate projections, and calculated species turnover and changes in species-specific climate suitability. We found that the choice of baseline climate data constituted an important source of uncertainty in projections of both species turnover and species-specific climate suitability, often comparable with, or more important than, uncertainty arising from the choice of GCM. Importantly, the relative contribution of these factors to projection uncertainty varied spatially. Moreover, when projecting SDMs to sites of biodiversity importance (Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas), these uncertainties altered site-level impacts, which could affect conservation prioritization. Our results highlight that projections of species' responses to climate change are sensitive to uncertainty in the baseline climatology.

We found that, apart from a few abundant species, pollinators with original traits either had few interaction partners or interacted most frequently with a subset of these partners. This suggests that narrowing of interactions to a subset of the plant community accompanies pollinator niche specialisation, congruent with our hypothesised trade-off between having unique traits vs. being able to interact with many mutualist partners.

Historically, spiny lobster, queen conch and over 20 other reef species have been exploited here. Multispecies intervention management from an ecosystem perspective has been developed in this area; however, an assessment of the effects of such practices on ecosystem health is required. Five quantitative trophic models were constructed using Ecopath with Ecosim. The results show that, in terms of biomass, benthic autotrophs are the dominant group in all communities. Ecosystem Network Analysis indices showed that Cueva de Tiburones was the most mature, developed, complex and healthy subsystem, but, El Colorado and La Baliza were the subsystems most resistant to disturbances. The fisheries mainly concentrate on primary (La Baliza and Cueva de Tiburones sites) and secondary consumers (La Caldera, Chancay, and El Colorado). The greatest propagation of direct and indirect effects, estimated by Mixed Trophic Impacts and Ecosim simulations, were generated by the benthic autotrophs, small benthic epifauna, benthic-pelagic carnivorous fish and benthic carnivorous fish, among others. In contrast, the System Recovery Time showed different patterns among subsystems, indicating several compartments that reduce resilience. Considering the structure, dynamics, trophic functioning and ecosystem health of Banco Chinchorro, its ecological heterogeneity highlights the need for the design of a specific (by subsystem) management strategy, particularly because different species or functional groups present greater sensitivity to human interventions in each community.",,,,"de Jesus Navarrete, Alberto/X-9763-2019; Rodriguez Zaragoza, Fabian Alejandro/B-3477-2015","Rodriguez Zaragoza, Fabian Alejandro/0000-0002-0066-4275; HERNANDEZ-FLORES, ALVARO/0000-0003-1900-9868; Castro Perez, Jose Manuel/0000-0003-3272-6570",,,,,,,,,,,,1585-8553,1588-2756,,,,JUN,2016,17,1,,,,,48,60,,10.1556/168.2016.17.1.7,,,,,,,WOS:000388003500007,,,,,,

They provide a connection between local community assembly and regional-level processes. One of the more widely used methods to address questions related to metacommunity concepts is those that characterize elements of metacommunity structure by quantifying aspects of coherence, species turnover, and boundary clumping. In this study, we used this approach to study the spatial ecology of freshwater fishes in Texas. Stream-fish assemblages in Texas provide an excellent opportunity to examine the patterns of metacommunity structure due to the number of drainages that empty directly into the Gulf of Mexico, which minimizes the likelihood of dispersal between basins while allowing for longitudinal movement within basins. We used fisheries data published by the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and from the North American Water Quality Association, which consisted of 94 sampling localities distributed across 18 river basins and 11 ecoregions. To examine within-basin patterns, we focused only on the Brazos, Colorado, and Trinity rivers because of the number of sites within each of these basins. From a taxonomic standpoint, we consistently observed Clementsian patterns regardless of whether it was among or within river basins, whereas we mostly observed Gleasonian patterns from a functional perspective. Only one functional group was found at all sites in each of the three main river basins, which consisted of invertivores with an equilibrium life-history strategy. Various bioclimatic variables were significantly correlated with metacommunity structure, but these correlations differed between taxonomic and functional organization and differed depending on which river basin was considered. The results of this study support previous findings that species composition and functional traits relate to environmental gradients, but further our understanding by providing additional evidence that species sorting processes are the dominant structuring mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1386-2588,1573-5125,,,,JUN,2016,50,2,,,,,247,259,,10.1007/s10452-016-9572-5,,,,,,,WOS:000376610200009,,,,,,

However, such predictions have a very weak empirical basis. In order to test the robustness of the pollination network to short-term disturbances, we removed inflorescences of the most connected species occurring in a lowland meadow network using the before-after approach and compared the result with that obtained by network modelling. The manipulated network showed no significant differences for the most commonly used metrics, but was more generalized than control networks, owing to a change in the preferences of pollinators. Furthermore, no secondary extinctions (emigrations) were found, owing to the considerable natural variation found among insect species assemblages. Following elimination of the most linked plant species, a new hub was detected in the experimental meadow, the hub node being a plant species with a similar inflorescence to that removed, and formerly playing the role of a peripheral node. We conclude that exclusion of the main food source forced insects to change their specialized preferences to other plant species that were available.

Among the natural disturbances in Europe, windstorms cause the highest economic loss. After such storms, damaged forest stands are commonly salvage logged to restore economic value. However, such interventions could affect species assemblages of various taxonomic groups, including breeding birds. Despite these potential effects, investigations of the impacts of post-storm logging are largely lacking. We thus investigated assemblages of breeding birds in 21 logged and 21 unlogged windstorm-disturbed forest plots and 18 undisturbed, control forest plots using fixed-radius point-stop counts three, five and seven years after a windstorm within the Bavarian Forest National Park as part of the European Long-Term Ecosystem Research Network. We recorded 2100 bird individuals of 55 bird species. Bird assemblages were predominantly altered by the consequences of the windstorm and affected only to a minor degree by subsequent logging of storm felled trees. Nevertheless, bird species richness was significantly reduced by post-storm logging within the first season. In general, the windstorm led to a shift in bird assemblage composition from typical forest species towards open- and shrub-land species. Assemblages of logged and unlogged disturbed plots consisted mainly of long-distance migrants and ground-foraging bird species, whereas assemblages of undisturbed control plots consisted of resident species that forage within vegetation. Both unlogged and logged storm-felled coniferous forest stands were inhabited by endangered or declining bird species, such as Water Pipit (Anthus spinoletta) on logged plots and Eurasian Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) on unlogged plots. Indicator species analyses suggested that species of unlogged storm disturbed plots depended on storm-created legacies, such as pits and snags, for foraging and nesting. Hence, we recommend reducing post-storm logging of these legacies to support species restricted to unlogged disturbed forest. To increase the diversity of breeding birds on the landscape scale, diverse logged and unlogged post-disturbance stands should be provided, which could be gained by a partial benign neglect strategy of storm disturbed forest stands.

To reconstruct the presence/absence of predator-prey interactions, we assembled detailed quantitative information from the scientific literature on the stomach contents of 80 predator species (elasmobranchs, teleosts and invertebrates) collected in the Golfo de Tortugas (Colombia) between 1990 and 2009. We tested three conceptual models of network structure (random, small-world, and scale-free), characterized by different system properties and tolerance to perturbations, to evaluate which one better fitted the reconstructed food web. Our results suggest that this network has small-world structure and scale-free properties. An impact on one species may therefore spread to many species through short interaction chains; only a few nodes with high centrality values would support the network structure. However, contrary to current theory, our analysis revealed no clear relationships between species with high centrality and the large-scale structural patterns observed in the network (small-world and scale-free properties). This observation indicates that ecosystem-based fisheries management should prioritize not only high centrality species (e.g., shrimps, which furthermore are species of high commercial value in the area), but should also consider species with unique structural properties such as those with little or no topological redundancy such as large sharks. For this reason, top predator conservation needs more attention than currently received in fisheries management. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory Analysis data detected a significant loss of live shore pine biomass in Alaska, with greater losses among larger trees and no known cause. We installed 46 permanent plots to monitor shore pine health and survival.

Western gall rust, bole wounds, and Dothistroma needle blight were the most common forms of damage to live shore pine. Western gall rust bole gall presence best predicted crown dieback. Shore pine had more bole wounds than associated trees, with wound incidence and severity of live trees increasing with tree diameter. Secondary bark beetles and stain fungi were detected on dying and dead shore pine.

Sampling took place over a three-year period (2010-2012) in the Rhine-Main-Observatory LTER site on the Kinzig River, central Germany. This allowed disentangling the combined influence, and temporal variability, of habitat connectivity (i.e. between aquatic and terrestrial) and dispersal ability (i.e. between spiders and beetles, and aerial and aquatic dispersing invertebrates) on the dominant paradigms structuring these metacommunities. We found mostly consistent differences in the manner that metacommunities were structured between groups, with lower levels of variability explained for beetles compared to the other groups. Beetles were consistently structured more by turnover than nestedness components, with greater beta diversity than expected by chance and a minor spatial compared to environmental signal emerging with variance partitioning. Conversely, spiders and benthic invertebrates had lower beta diversity and greater nestedness than null expectation, and a clearer spatial signal controlling metacommunity structure. Our results suggest varying levels of mass effects and species sorting shape river-floodplain metacommunities, depending on habitat connectivity and dispersal ability.

Indeed, we found that networks at intermediate grazing intensities were larger, more generalized, more modular, and contained more diverse and even interactions.

We have explored the temporal dynamics of individual-based plant networks resulting from pairwise similarities in pollinator composition. During two flowering seasons, we surveyed the phenology and pollinator fauna of the individual plants from a population of Erysimum mediohispanicum (Brassicaceae). We analyzed the topology of these networks by means of their modularity, clustering, and core-periphery structure. These metrics are related to network functional properties such as cohesion, transitivity and centralization respectively. Afterwards, we analyzed the influence of each pollinator functional group on network topology. We found that network topology varied widely over time as a consequence of the differences in plant phenology and the idiosyncratic and contextual effect of pollinators. When integrating all temporary networks, the network became cohesive (non modular), transitive (locally clusterized), and centralized (core-periphery topology).

We propose a framework that can elucidate the complex relationship between invasibility and invasiveness. It is based on trait-mediated interactions between species and depicts the response of an ecological network to the intrusion of an alien species, drawing on the concept of community saturation. Here, invasiveness of an introduced species with a particular trait is measured by its per capita population growth rate when the initial propagule pressure of the introduced species is very low. The invasibility of the recipient habitat or ecosystem is dependent on the structure of the resident ecological network and is defined as the total width of an opportunity niche in the trait space susceptible to invasion. Invasibility is thus a measure of network instability. We also correlate invasibility with the asymptotic stability of resident ecological network, measured by the leading eigenvalue of the interaction matrix that depicts trait-based interaction intensity multiplied by encounter rate (a pairwise product of propagule pressure of all members in a community). We further examine the relationship between invasibility and network architecture, including network connectance, nestedness and modularity. We exemplify this framework with a trait-based assembly model under perturbations in ways to emulate fluctuating resources and random trait composition in ecological networks. The maximum invasiveness of a potential invader (greatest intrinsic population growth rate) was found to be positively correlated with invasibility of the recipient ecological network. Additionally, ecosystems with high network modularity and high ecological stability tend to exhibit high invasibility. Where quantitative data are lacking we propose using a qualitative interaction matrix of the ecological network perceived by a potential invader so that the structural network stability and invasibility can be estimated from the literature or from expert opinion. This approach links network structure, invasiveness and invasibility in the context of trait-mediated interactions, such as the invasion of insects into mutualistic and antagonistic networks.",,,,"Roy, Helen/A-1488-2010; Richardson, David M/A-1495-2008; Hui, Cang/A-1781-2008; Landi, Pietro/P-7371-2018; Garnas, Jeff/C-4363-2008","Richardson, David M/0000-0001-9574-8297; Hui, Cang/0000-0002-3660-8160; Landi, Pietro/0000-0002-6373-2992; Minoarivelo, Henintsoa Onivola/0000-0002-0046-7597; Garnas, Jeff/0000-0002-9956-9875",,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,APR,2016,18,4,,,,,971,983,,10.1007/s10530-016-1076-7,,,,,,,WOS:000373225700007,,,,,,

It is therefore crucial to assess the reliability of such tools. Based on the traditional simulation of node (species) removal, mutualistic pollination networks are considered to be relatively robust because of their 1) truncated power-law degree distribution, 2) redundancy in the number of pollinators per plant and 3) nested interaction pattern. However, species removal is only one of several possible approaches to network robustness assessment. Empirical evidence suggests a decline in abundance prior to the extinction of interacting species, arguing in favour of an interaction removal-based approach (i.e. interaction disruption), as opposed to traditional species removal. For simulated networks, these two approaches yield radically different conclusions, but no tests are currently available for empirical mutualistic networks. This study compared this new robustness evaluation approach based on interaction extinction versus the traditional species removal approach for 12 alpine and subalpine pollination networks. In comparison with species removal, interaction removal produced higher robustness in the worst-case extinction scenario but lower robustness in the best-case extinction scenario. Our results indicate that: 1) these two approaches yield very different conclusions and 2) existing assessments of ecological network robustness could be overly optimistic, at least those based on a disturbance affecting species at random or beginning with the least connected species.

Whether such changes modify interactions between species and the networks in which they are embedded remain fundamental questions to assess the 'health' and ecosystem functionality of logged forests. We focus on interactions between lianas and their tree hosts within primary and selectively logged forests in the biodiversity hotspot of Malaysian Borneo. We found that lianas were more abundant, had higher species richness, and different species compositions in logged than in primary forests. Logged forests showed heavier liana loads disparately affecting slow growing tree species, which could exacerbate the loss of timber value and carbon storage already associated with logging. Moreover, simulation scenarios of host tree local species loss indicated that logging might decrease the robustness of liana-tree interaction networks if heavily infested trees (i.e. the most connected ones) were more likely to disappear. This effect is partially mitigated in the short term by the colonization of host trees by a greater diversity of liana species within logged forests, yet this might not compensate for the loss of preferred tree hosts in the long term. As a consequence, species interaction networks may show a lagged response to disturbance, which may trigger sudden collapses in species richness and ecosystem function in response to additional disturbances, representing a new type of 'extinction debt'.",,,,"Laurance, William F/B-2709-2012; Benedick, Suzan/M-2529-2016; Edwards, David/AAC-5091-2019; Santamaria, Luis/C-1438-2012","Laurance, William F/0000-0003-4430-9408; Edwards, David/0000-0001-8562-3853; Santamaria, Luis/0000-0002-5072-2912; Senior, Rebecca/0000-0002-8208-736X; Benedick, Suzan/0000-0003-2587-3644",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,MAR 16,2016,283,1826,,,,,,,20153008,10.1098/rspb.2015.3008,,,,,,,WOS:000374921900027,26936241,,,,,

The most sensitive plants, birds and mammals decline or disappear from the disturbed sites, and the species composition shifts from 'wild' species to cultural and human associated species. There is little research on the spread of alien species, but the few examples show that alien species can be promoted by tourism activities. Impacts of the use of motorized vehicles have not been widely studied either, despite the extensive track network which can cause disturbance to wildlife. The integrated impacts of tourism and climate change on the vegetation and wildlife was not addressed directly in any of the reviewed studies.

Countries that are nutritionally or economically dependent on international trade of a commodity may be adversely affected by such shocks. While exposure to shocks has been studied in financial markets, communication networks, and some infrastructure systems, it has received less attention in food-trade networks. Here, we develop a forward shock-propagation model to quantify how trade flows are redistributed under a range of shock scenarios and assess the food-security outcomes by comparing changes in national fish supplies to indices of each country's nutritional fish dependency. Shock propagation and distribution among regions are modeled on a network of historical bilateral seafood trade data from UN Comtrade using 205 reporting territories grouped into 18 regions. In our model exposure to shocks increases with total imports and the number of import partners. We find that Central and West Africa are the most vulnerable to shocks, with their vulnerability increasing when a willingness-to-pay proxy is included. These findings suggest that countries can reduce their overall vulnerability to shocks by reducing reliance on imports and diversifying food sources.

Many shorebird species perform long-distance migrations and while moving between breeding and wintering grounds, they depend on a network of intermediate wetlands (stopover sites) where populations of different origins extensively overlap. The difficulty to discriminate such populations represents a serious obstacle to the identification of the links between breeding or wintering areas and stopover sites, and also precludes the estimation of demographic parameters for each population. In this study, we test if linear discriminant models based on stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in toenails can he used to identify populations of several shorebird species of different wintering origins overlapping at two stopover sites of the East Atlantic Flyway. In addition, we evaluate the ability of this approach to infer migratory phenological patterns of shorebirds. Linear discriminant analyses performed overall well in distinguishing the isotopic signals of birds from wintering areas (in France, Portugal, Morocco, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau) most species, correctly classifying over 80% (n = 542) of all wintering individuals sampled at these areas. Assignment rates of shorebirds captured during spring migration were also high (96%, n=323) at the Tejo estuary, Portugal, but lower (40%, 0 = 185) at Marennes-Oleron Bay in France, and also differed among species. A large proportion of spring migrants captured in Portugal and France were assigned to Banc d' Arguin in Mauritania, the most important wintering area in the flyway. Phenological patterns derived for dunlins (Calidris alpina), common ringed plovers (Charadrius hiaticula) and grey plovers (Pluvinlis squatarola) suggest that the first northward migrants started arriving at the Tejo estuary during the second half of March, with peaking numbers occurring during April or May.",,,,"Alves, Jose A./U-4674-2018; Carneiro, Camilo/U-4649-2018; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro/E-8060-2011; Bearhop, Stuart/G-3105-2012; Lopes, Ricardo Jorge/B-1805-2010; Catry, Teresa/A-8082-2012","Alves, Jose A./0000-0001-7182-0936; Carneiro, Camilo/0000-0002-9803-2144; Granadeiro, Jose Pedro/0000-0002-7207-3474; Bearhop, Stuart/0000-0002-5864-0129; Lopes, Ricardo Jorge/0000-0003-2193-5107; Piersma, Theunis/0000-0001-9668-466X; Catry, Teresa/0000-0003-4047-9995",,,,,,,,,,,,1439-1791,1618-0089,,,,MAR,2016,17,2,,,,,177,187,,10.1016/j.baae.2015.10.005,,,,,,,WOS:000371313700009,,,,,,

We investigated the effect of these two measures on local species richness, single species occurrence and beta diversity of grassland birds in Poland. We counted birds on AES parcels (with less intensive grassland management) and control parcels, both within and outside Special Protection Areas (SPAS, part of Natura 2000), during 2013-2014. Local species richness of AES-target birds was not associated with AES. Similarly, the turnover of AES-target species among sites was comparable at AES and control parcels. Furthermore, no positive interaction between AES and SPAs was observed, indicating a general lack of effect of AES. Local species richness of SPA-target birds was not higher within than outside SPAs, but two SPA-target species were more common and the beta diversity of SPA-target species was higher within than outside SPAS. Thus, our study showed no positive effects of AES on the occurrence of their target species, but confirmed some positive effects of SPAs on their target species. The decision to restrict AES to Special Protection Areas in 2015-2020 has no justification in our analyses. Actually, many AES-target species will be protected within SPAs irrespective of whether the area is an AES or not, but future AES should also include parcels outside SPAS, as many target species occur there. However, to improve the effectiveness of AES management prescriptions should be diversified and customized to meet the largely different habitat preferences of present target species (such as, for instance, the lapwing and corncrake).

The potential role marine reserves may play in mitigating the effects of reduced water quality has received little attention. We investigated the spatial and temporal variability in live coral and macro-algal cover and water quality during moderate and major flooding events of the Fitzroy River within the Keppel Bay region of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park from 2007 to 2013. We used 7 years of remote sensing data on water quality and data from long-term monitoring of coral reefs to quantify exposure of coral reefs to flood plumes. We used a distance linear model to partition the contribution of abiotic and biotic factors, including zoning, as drivers of the observed changes in coral and macro-algae cover. Moderate flood plumes from 2007 to 2009 did not affect coral cover on reefs in the Keppel Islands, suggesting the reef has intrinsic resistance against short-term exposure to reduced water quality. However, from 2009 to 2013, live coral cover declined by approximate to 50% following several weeks of exposure to turbid, low salinity water from major flood plume events in 2011 and subsequent moderate events in 2012 and 2013. Although the flooding events in 2012 and 2013 were smaller than the flooding events between 2007 to 2009, the ability of the reefs to withstand these moderate floods was lost, as evidenced by a approximate to 20% decline in coral cover between 2011 to 2013. Although zoning (no-take reserve or fished) was identified a significant driver of coral cover, we recorded consistently lower coral cover on reserve reefs than on fished reefs throughout the study period and significantly lower cover in 2011. Our findings suggest that even reefs with an inherent resistance to reduced water quality are not able to withstand repeated disturbance events. The limitations of reserves in mitigating the effects of reduced water quality on near-shore coral reefs underscores the importance of integrated management approaches that combine effective land-based management with networks of no-take reserves.",,,,"browne, Nicola/W-6612-2019; Ceccarelli, Daniela/AAN-3577-2020","Browne, nicola/0000-0002-7160-6865; Williamson, David/0000-0001-8447-039X",,,,,,,,,,,,0888-8892,1523-1739,,,,FEB,2016,30,1,,,,,142,153,,10.1111/cobi.12576,,,,,,,WOS:000368938000016,26132810,,,,,

Common prior to white-nose syndrome, the population of this bat species has declined to functional extirpation in some regions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, including portions of the central Appalachians. Our long-term research in the central Appalachians has shown that maternity colonies of this species form non-random assorting networks in patches of suitable trees that result from longand short-term forest disturbance processes, and that roost loss can occur with these disturbances. Following two consecutive prescribed burns on the Fernow Experimental Forest in the central Appalachians, West Virginia, USA, in 2007 to 2008, post-fire counts of suitable black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.; the most selected species for roosting) slightly decreased by 2012. Conversely, post-fire numbers of suitable maple (Acer spp. L.), primarily red maple (Acer rubrum L.), increased by a factor of three, thereby ameliorating black locust reduction. Maternity colony network metrics such as roost degree (use) and network density for two networks in the burned compartment were similar to the single network observed in unburned forest. However, roost clustering and degree of roost centralization was greater for the networks in the burned forest area. Accordingly, the short-term effects of prescribed fire are slightly or moderately positive in impact to day-roost habitat for the northern long-eared bat in the central Appalachians from a social dynamic perspective. Listing of northern long-eared bats as federally threatened will bring increased scrutiny of immediate fire impacts from direct take as well as indirect impacts from long-term changes to roosting and foraging habitat in stands being returned to historic fire-return conditions. Unfortunately, definitive impacts will remain speculative owing to the species' current rarity and the paucity of forest stand data that considers tree condition or that adequately tracks snags spatially and temporally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1933-9747,,,,,,2016,12,2,,,,,13,27,,10.4996/fireecology.1202013,,,,,,,WOS:000391959200003,,,,,,

Lakes may be especially vulnerable to climatic perturbations, which can trigger sudden ecosystem changes through alterations in the hydrologic regime. However, the nature of lake response to climatic extremes, and associated longterm ecosystem-level implications are difficult to predict, due to the paucity of time series allowing exploration of ecosystem behavior before, during, and after extreme events. We investigated the impacts of the 2003 European heatwave on a small, stratifying lake by analyzing available limnological data between 1986 and 2012. In summer 2003, a shift from an unvegetated to a macrophyte-dominated regime occurred, due to the rapid spread of a benthic charophyte. We explored candidate mechanisms driving the shift by comparing empirical observations with the outcome of a model on lake alternative states parameterized for our study lake. Our results support the hypothesis that enhanced light availability due to a heatwave-induced decrease in water level drove the switch in dominant primary producers. The spread of the charophyte was associated with strong depletion of inorganic nutrients and suppression of the typical summer phytoplankton peak. These bottom-up interactions triggered cascading effects at higher trophic levels, inducing a decline in herbivorous zooplankters with high food requirements and in predatory taxa. Some of the changes in the lake food web persist through the available time series. If incidence of heatwaves increases, as projected across temperate regions, our findings suggest that abrupt and long-lasting ecosystem-level reorganizations may occur in small, stratifying lakes.",,,,"Rossetti, Giampaolo/I-5703-2014","Rossetti, Giampaolo/0000-0002-8136-6965",,,,,,,,,,,,1432-9840,1435-0629,,,,JAN,2016,19,1,,,,,16,31,,10.1007/s10021-015-9914-5,,,,,,,WOS:000373017800002,,,,,,

These tools now have the potential to inform fisheries management and species conservation, particularly for small fragmented populations under threat from exploitation and disturbance. In this study, we resolve patterns of larval dispersal for a population of the anemonefish Amphiprion melanopus in the Keppel Islands (southern Great Barrier Reef). Habitat loss and fishing appear to have impacted this population and a network of no-take marine reserves currently protects 75% of the potential breeders. Using parentage analysis, we estimate that 21% of recruitment in the island group was generated locally and that breeding adults living in reserves were responsible for 79% (31 of 39) of these of locally produced juveniles. Overall, the network of reserves was fully connected via larval dispersal; however, one reserve was identified as a critical source of larvae for the island group. The population in the Keppel Islands also appears to be well-connected to other source populations at least 60km away, given that 79% (145 of 184) of the juveniles sampled remained unassigned in the parentage analysis. We estimated the effective size of the A.melanopus metapopulation to be 745 (582-993 95% CI) and recommend continued monitoring of its genetic status.

How these lineages are related to one another is still not fully resolved, largely due to the fact that large geographical regions remain poorly sampled both at the core and periphery of the species' range. Analyses of ancient wolves have also suffered from uneven sampling, but have shown indications of a major turnover at some point during the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary in northern North America. Here we analyze variation in the mitochondrial control region in 122 contemporary wolves from some of the less studied populations, as well as six samples from the previously unstudied Greenland subspecies (Canis I. orlon) and two Late Pleistocene samples from Siberia. Together with the publicly available control region sequences of both modern and ancient wolves, this study examines genetic diversity on a wide geographical and temporal scale that includes both Eurasia and North America. We identify 13 new haplotypes, of which the majority is found in northern and eastern Asia. The results show that the Greenland samples are all represented by one haplotype, previously identified in North American wolves, among which this population seems to trace its maternal lineage. The phylogeny and network analyses show a wide spatial distribution of several lineages, but also some clusters with more distinct geographical affiliation. In North America, we find support for an end-Pleistocene population bottleneck through coalescent simulations under an approximate Bayesian framework in contrast to previous studies that suggested an extinction-replacement event. However, we find no support for a similar bottleneck in Eurasia.

Strategic barrier removal has the potential to improve connectivity in stream networks, but managers lack a consistent framework for determining which projects will most benefit target species. The objective of this study is to develop a method for identifying and prioritizing action on road crossings in order to restore stream network connectivity. We demonstrate the method using a case study from the Pine-Popple watershed in Wisconsin. First, we propose a new metric for quantifying stream connectivity status for stream-resident fish. The metric quantifies the individual and cumulative effects of barriers on reach and watershed level connectivity, while accounting for natural barriers, distance-based dispersal limitations and variation in habitat type and quality. We conducted a comprehensive field survey of road crossings in the watershed to identify barriers and estimate replacement costs. Of the 190 surveyed road crossings, 74% were determined to be barriers to the movement of at least one species or life stage of fish, primarily due to high water velocity, low water depth or outlet drops. The results of the barrier removal prioritization show that initial projects targeted for mitigation create much greater improvements in connectivity per unit cost than later projects. Benefit-cost curves from this type of analysis can be used to evaluate potential projects within and among watersheds and minimize overall expenditures for specified restoration targets.

Global road networks represent one of the most significant human impacts on ecosystems, and a spatially extensive source of anthropogenic disturbance and noise. We developed a novel approach by combining traffic monitoring with noise mapping on the basis of a standardized traffic-noise stimulus generated by controlled vehicle operation to investigate temporal and spatial heterogeneity of traffic noise. We used animal presence or absence, radio-telemetric monitoring of space use, and remotely sensed habitat characteristics with occupancy modeling and spatial analysis to assess influences of distance from roads, habitat characteristics, and traffic noise level on site occupancy and space use of Mt. Graham red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis). Traffic noise had spatially extensive and negative effects on site occupancy. Animal occurrence decreased as traffic noise increased after accounting for distance from roads. Traffic noise levels in animal core home ranges were lower than noise levels within total home ranges. Our study disentangled effects of traffic noise from confounding environmental characteristics and demonstrated the chronic impacts of traffic noise on animal distribution. We highlight the importance of incorporating spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic noise at a local scale when investigating effects of anthropogenic noise on wildlife. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Many trout populations are limited to headwater streams where negative effects of predicted climate change, including reduced stream flow and increased risk of catastrophic fires, may further jeopardize their persistence. Headwater streams in steep terrain are especially susceptible to disturbance associated with postfire debris flows, which have led to local extirpation of trout populations in some systems. We conducted a reach-scale spatial analysis of debris-flow risk among 11 high-elevation watersheds of the Colorado Rocky Mountains occupied by isolated populations of Colorado River Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus). Stream reaches at high risk of disturbance by postfire debris flow were identified with the aid of a qualitative model based on 4 primary initiating and transport factors (hillslope gradient, flow accumulation pathways, channel gradient, and valley confinement). This model was coupled with a spatially continuous survey of trout distributions in these stream networks to assess the predicted extent of trout population disturbances related to debris flows. In the study systems, debris-flow potential was highest in the lower and middle reaches of most watersheds. Colorado River Cutthroat Trout occurred in areas of high postfire debris-flow risk, but they were never restricted to those areas. Postfire debris flows could extirpate trout from local reaches in these watersheds, but trout populations occupy refugia that should allow recolonization of interconnected, downstream reaches. Specific results of our study may not be universally applicable, but our risk assessment approach can be applied to assess postfire debris-flow risk for stream reaches in other watersheds.",,,,"Gresswell, Robert E./ABH-8944-2020","Gresswell, Robert/0000-0003-0063-855X",,,,,,,,,,,,2161-9549,2161-9565,,,,DEC,2015,34,4,,,,,1558,1570,,10.1086/684094,,,,,,,WOS:000364815000028,,,,,,

Bacterial communities were characterized by Actinobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria, and fungal communities by Lecanoromycetes and Archaeosporomycetes. The composition of bacterial or fungal communities was not observed to vary between loamy or sandy soils. There were no differences in richness of either bacterial or fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the soil of young or old foraging pits, or undisturbed soils. Although the bacterial assemblage did not vary among the three microsites, the composition of fungi in undisturbed soils was significantly different from that in old or young foraging pits. Network analysis indicated that a greater number of correlations between bacterial OTUs occurred in undisturbed soils and old pits, whereas a greater number of correlations between fungal OTUs occurred in undisturbed soils. Our study suggests that digging by soil-disturbing animals is likely to create successional shifts in soil microbial and fungal communities, leading to functional shifts associated with the decomposition of organic matter and the fixation of nitrogen.

Evaluating functional connectivity is critical for predicting range shifts, developing conservation plans, and anticipating effects of disturbance, especially for species affected by climate change. Objectives We examined whether simplifying forest structure influenced animal movements and whether an experimental approach to quantifying functional connectivity reflects normal behavior, which is often assumed but remains untested. Methods We evaluated functional connectivity for Pacific marten (Martes caurina) across a gradient in forest structural complexity using two novel methods for this species: incentivized food-titration experiments and non-incentivized locations collected via GPS telemetry (24 individuals). Results Food titration experiments revealed martens selected complex stands, and martens entered and crossed areas with reduced forest cover when motivated by bait, particularly in the winter. However, our telemetry data showed that without such incentive, martens avoided openings and simple stands and selected complex forest stands equally during summer and winter. Conclusions Detections at baited stations may not represent typical habitat preferences during winter, and incentivized experiments reflect the capacity of martens to enter non-preferred stand types under high motivation (e.g., hunger, curiosity, dispersal). We hypothesize snow cover facilitates connectivity across openings when such motivation is present; thus, snow cover may benefit dispersing animals and increase population connectivity.

However, the effectiveness of these ENs for maintaining freshwater biodiversity, especially that of still waters, is poorly known. In response, we compare mud wallows of large mammals, ponds and small marshes in an EN with those in an adjacent World Heritage Site protected area (PA) as reference. For this comparison we used dragonfly adults in view of their effectiveness as bioindicators. A total of 47 species was recorded at 105 sites. The EN shared 74% of its species with the PA. However, equal numbers of range restricted species were recorded from the EN and the PA. Five species were recorded as particular to the EN and seven to the PA, probably due to habitat heterogeneity across this type of landscape. Pond size, habitat heterogeneity, elevation and dissolved oxygen were important determinants for species richness and diversity. Proximity of plantation trees had only a minor effect, and then only on species composition. Mud wallows were the poorest habitat in terms of dragonfly diversity, owing to the intense disturbance. Wallows, ponds and marshes were largely complementary in their species composition. Overall, the freshwater system in the EN was a good surrogate for that in the PA, indicating the effectiveness of these ENs for maintaining the dragonfly assemblage. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Although the debate on Pleistocene extinctions has focused on the roles of climate change and humans, the impact of perturbations depends on properties of ecological communities, such as species composition and the organization of ecological interactions. Here, we combined palaeoecological and ecological data, food-web models and community stability analysis to investigate if differences between Pleistocene and modern mammalian assemblages help us understand why the inegafauna died out in the Americas while persisting in Africa. We show Pleistocene and modern assemblages share similar network topology, but differences in richness and body size distributions made Pleistocene communities significantly more vulnerable to the effects of human arrival. The structural changes promoted by humans in Pleistocene networks would have increased the likelihood of unstable dynamics, which may favour extinction cascades in communities facing extrinsic perturbations.

LocationWest Africa. MethodsWe use correlative species distribution models to relate species (amphibians, birds, mammals) distributions to modelled contemporary climates, and projected future distributions across the PA network. Climate data were simulated using a physically based regional climate model to dynamically downscale GCMs. GCMs were selected because they accurately reproduce important regional climate regimes and generate a range of regional climate change responses. We quantify uncertainty arising from projected climate change, modelling methodology and spatial dependency, and assess the spatial and temporal patterns of climate change impacts for biodiversity across the PA network. ResultsSubstantial species turnover across the network is projected for all three taxonomic groups by 2100 (amphibians=42.5% (median); birds=35.2%; mammals=37.9%), although uncertainty is high, particularly for amphibians and mammals, and, importantly, increases across the century. However, consistent patterns of impacts across taxa emerge by early to mid-century, suggesting high impacts across the Lower Guinea forest. Main conclusionsReducing (e.g. using appropriate climate projections) and quantifying uncertainty in climate change impact assessments helps clarify likely impacts. Consistent patterns of high biodiversity impacts emerge in the early and mid-century projections, while end-of-century projections are too uncertain for reliable assessments. We recommend that climate change adaptation should focus on earlier projections, where we have most confidence in species responses, rather than on end-of-century projections that are frequently used.

Although local variation in territorial predator density is often correlated with habitat quality, the causal mechanism underlying this frequently observed association is poorly understood and could stem from facultative adjustment in either group size or territory size. To test between these alternative hypotheses, we used a novel statistical framework to construct a winter population-level utilization distribution for wolves (Canis lupus) in northern Ontario, which we then linked to a suite of environmental variables to determine factors influencing wolf space use. Next, we compared habitat quality metrics emerging from this analysis as well as an independent measure of prey abundance, with pack size and territory size to investigate which hypothesis was most supported by the data. We show that wolf space use patterns were concentrated near deciduous, mixed deciduous/coniferous and disturbed forest stands favoured by moose (Alces alces), the predominant prey species in the diet of wolves in northern Ontario, and in proximity to linear corridors, including shorelines and road networks remaining from commercial forestry activities. We then demonstrate that landscape metrics of wolf habitat quality - projected wolf use, probability of moose occupancy and proportion of preferred land cover classes - were inversely related to territory size but unrelated to pack size. These results suggest that wolves in boreal ecosystems alter territory size, but not pack size, in response to local variation in habitat quality. This could be an adaptive strategy to balance trade-offs between territorial defence costs and energetic gains due to resource acquisition. That pack size was not responsive to habitat quality suggests that variation in group size is influenced by other factors such as intraspecific competition between wolf packs.",,,,"Avgar, Tal/W-9520-2019","Avgar, Tal/0000-0002-8764-6976; Kittle, Andrew/0000-0002-7334-4766",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,SEP,2015,84,5,,,,,1177,1186,,10.1111/1365-2656.12366,,,,,,,WOS:000360093400004,25757794,,,,,

We analysed data on biomass, P/B ratios, catches, food spectra, and the consumption and dynamics of commercial and non-commercial species or functional groups using the Ecopath with Ecosim framework. The biomass of the Rhodophyta group, which contributed 25.5% of the total system biomass, was the most abundant compartment in Mejillones bay, whilst the bivalve Transenella pannosa recorded the highest biomass (similar to 39%) in Antofagasta bay. Amongst the carnivores, the commercial gastropod Tais chocolata (similar to 2%) and the sea star Luidia magallanica (similar to 4%) were the compartment containing the highest biomass in Mejillones Bay and Antofagasta Bay, respectively. Based on the magnitudes of Pp/R, Relative Ascendency (A/C), Relative Overhead (Ov/C), Redundancy, Finn's cycling index and the system recovery time (SRT), the benthic system of Antofagasta Bay was more developed or mature and, in turn, less resistant against perturbations compared to Mejillones Bay. The outcomes of the mixed trophic impacts (MTI) indicate that the small epifauna carnivore (SEC) and the phytoplankton propagate the highest magnitudes of direct and indirect effects on the remaining compartments in the Mejillones and Antofagasta bays, respectively. According to the Ecosim short-term simulations (increasing 10,30 and 50% the mortality by fishing and/or toxic substances) the snail Tegula spp. had the highest impact on the other compartments in mejillones Bay, whilst the bivalve T. pannosa exhibited the highest impacts in Antofagasta Bay.

Investigating how and why mating deviates from random is important for understanding evolutionary processes as well as informing conservation and management. Prior to the implementation of parentage analyses, understanding mating patterns in solitary, elusive species like bears was virtually impossible. Here, we capitalize on a long-term genetic data set collected from black bears (Ursus americanus) (N=2422) in the Northern Lower Peninsula (NLP) of Michigan, USA. We identified mated pairs using parentage analysis and applied logistic regression (selection) models that controlled for features of the social network, to quantify the effects of individual characteristics, and spatial and population demographic factors on mating dynamics. Logistic regression models revealed that black bear mating was associated with spatial proximity of mates, male age, the time a pair had coexisted, local population density and relatedness. Mated pairs were more likely to contain older males. On average, bears tended to mate with nearby individuals to whom they were related, which does not support the existence of kin recognition in black bears. Pairwise relatedness was especially high for mated pairs containing young males. Restricted dispersal and high male turnover from intensive harvest mortality of NLP black bears are probably the underlying factors associated with younger male bears mating more often with female relatives. Our findings illustrate how harvest has the potential to disrupt the social structure of game species, which warrants further attention for conservation and management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,1365-294X,,,,AUG,2015,24,15,,,,,4010,4022,,10.1111/mec.13290,,,,,,,WOS:000358335300017,26113220,,,,,

We find flocks affected the responses of birds in three ways: (i) species with high propensity to flock were more sensitive to land use; (ii) different flock types, dominated by different flock leaders, varied in their sensitivity to land use and because following species have distinct preferences for leaders, this can have a cascading effect on followers' habitat selection; and (iii) those forest-interior species that remain outside of forests were found more inside flocks than would be expected by chance, as they may use flocks more in suboptimal habitat.

An experimental approach,BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anthropogenic disturbance can alter the structure of ecological networks in ways that have population consequences. For example, bird-plant networks in forests surrounded by urban land were more likely to be dominated by strong interactions (i.e., less even in strength) than networks in rural landscapes, and these asymmetric interactions depressed avian nest survival. Based on this prior research, we hypothesized that invasion of urban habitats by exotic plants was the underlying mechanism driving changes in network structure. We tested this hypothesis using an in situ experiment where exotic Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii) was removed from replicated 2-ha forest plots and compared bird-plant networks among urban removal forests, urban control forests dominated by honeysuckle, and rural forests with little honeysuckle. From 2005 to 2011, we surveyed densities of understory-nesting birds and nest predators, recorded information about nest location, and monitored nest survival. For each year and site network, we calculated evenness of interaction strengths. Despite post-removal vegetation resembling that in rural forests, removal of exotic honeysuckle did not restore network structure. Evenness of interactions between birds and plants was greatest in rural forests and least in urban control plots. Nest survival increased with evenness across all sites, but the relationship was strongest within urban removal plots, which had the lowest overall nest survival rates. Even though invasion by honeysuckle was a plausible driver of urban-associated network shifts in previous studies, the experimental removal suggested that factors other than invasion were responsible for network changes or that our system experienced hysteresis or time lags. Our study suggests that restoration of ecological networks may be more challenging than anticipated.",,,,"Rohr, Rudolf Philippe/K-9232-2015; Fortuna, Miguel A/D-4154-2013; Bascompte, Jordi/B-7596-2008; Rodewald, Amanda/I-6308-2016","Rohr, Rudolf Philippe/0000-0002-6440-2696; Fortuna, Miguel A/0000-0002-8374-1941; Bascompte, Jordi/0000-0002-0108-6411; Rodewald, Amanda/0000-0002-6719-6306",,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,1573-1464,,,,JUL,2015,17,7,,,,,2139,2146,,10.1007/s10530-015-0866-7,,,,,,,WOS:000355685700016,,,,,,

In total, 315 amphibians of 26 different species, 348 butterflies of 65 different species, 645 birds representing 77 different species were captured using mist netting and 877 bird records representing 79 different species were recorded using point counts. We provide evidence to show that the presence of a small unmarked road significantly altered levels of faunal species richness, diversity, relative abundance and community structure. This was true to a varying degree for all three taxa, up to and potentially beyond 350 m into the forest interior. Responses to the road were shown to be taxon specific. We found increasing proximity to the road had a negative effect on amphibian and understorey bird communities, whilst butterfly and overall diurnal bird communities responded positively.

Robustness of an aquatic ecosystem, specifically an estuarine system, is investigated here using indicators derived from ecological network analysis. Estuaries provide us with many ecosystem services and these are consequently prone to face anthropogenic stresses. In South Africa, temporarily open/closed estuaries occupy a significant percentage of coastal boundaries. One of the South African estuaries, namely Mdloti, is studied here using network-based, Ecopath software. The estuarine energy flow networks are perturbed following different scenarios, which are assumed to be a result of selected anthropogenic stresses (eutrophic'ation, overfishing) to the system. Several network indices such as total system throughput (TST), redundancy (R), Finn's Cycling Index (FCI) and ascendency over development capacity ratio (A/C) are calculated and analyzed for the original field-based network and three perturbed networks under different scenarios (change of autotrophic biomass, fish yield, and detritus import). The change of ecosystem robustness from the unperturbed network is more pronounced in the perturbed networks of fish biomass change and detritus import than change in autotrophic biomass scenario. These indicators reliably reflected the relative change of flow pattern if any changes occur and magnitude in the networks in different scenarios. From the present study, we show that certain common network indices as mentioned above provide a measure of robustness and can be used for the assessment of ecosystem organization and function. ENA properties and also robustness change depending on the type and magnitude of stress imposed on the system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we analyzed pollen-transport networks at two scales, i.e. pollinator species-plant species (sp-sp) and pollinator individuals-plant species (i-sp), and assessed whether modularity - a prevalent pattern in most pollination networks - is consistent across both scales. To test this we use three different algorithms developed for the calculation of modularity (unipartite, bipartite and weighted bipartite modularity) and compare the results obtained. Downscaling networks revealed a higher modular structure in i-sp networks than in sp-sp networks, regardless of the modular metric used. Using a null model approach, we show that modularity at the individual scale is originated by the existence of a high heterogeneity and specialization in the partition of pollen resources among conspecific individuals, a pattern which obviously cannot be observed at the species level. Modules in i-sp networks consisted of individuals sometimes neither taxonomically nor functionally related, but sharing common pollen resources at different moments of the flowering season. Interestingly, conspecific individuals may belong to different modules. Both plant and insect phenologies were important drivers of the modularity detected in individual-based networks, even determining the topological roles of nodes in the networks. A temporal turnover of modules was identified, i.e. modules of individuals assembled and disassembled over time as species modify their foraging choices throughout the flowering season adjusting to ecological conditions. Downscaling from species to individual-based networks is a promising approach to study the interplay among structural patterns and processes at different, but interdependent organizational levels.",,,,"Traveset, Anna V/D-7802-2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,MAY,2015,124,5,,,,,581,592,,10.1111/oik.01668,,,,,,,WOS:000356010300006,,,,,,

However, some ecosystems maintain relatively high diversity levels despite experiencing continuing disturbances. This indicates that some intrinsic properties prevent unstable dynamics and resulting extinctions. Identifying these ecosystem buffers' is crucial for our understanding of the stability of ecosystems and an important tool for environmental and conservation biologists. In this vein, weak interactions have been suggested as stabilizing elements of complex systems, but their relevance has rarely been tested experimentally. Here, using network and allometric theory, we present a novel concept for a priori identification of species that buffer against externally induced instability of increased population oscillations via weak interactions. We tested our model in a microcosm experiment using a soil food-web motif. Our results show that large-bodied species feeding at the food web's base, so called trophic whales', can buffer ecosystems against unstable dynamics induced by nutrient enrichment. Similar to the functionality of chemical or mechanical buffers, they serve as biotic buffers' that take up stressor effects and thus protect fragile systems from instability. We discuss trophic whales as common functional building blocks across ecosystems. Considering increasing stressor effects under anthropogenic global change, conservation of these network-intrinsic biotic buffers may help maintain the stability and diversity of natural ecosystems.",,,,"Schwarzmueller, Florian/P-5678-2019; Schwarzmuller, Florian/W-2675-2017; Brose, Ulrich/AAT-7547-2020; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-3191-2019; Brose, Ulrich/I-3488-2014; Eisenhauer, Nico/I-5932-2012","Schwarzmueller, Florian/0000-0001-9751-0565; Schwarzmuller, Florian/0000-0001-9751-0565; Brose, Ulrich/0000-0001-9156-583X; Eisenhauer, Nico/0000-0002-0371-6720; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,MAY,2015,84,3,,,,,680,691,,10.1111/1365-2656.12324,,,,,,,WOS:000353405300011,25420573,,,,,

In contrast, community ecology has traditionally assumed that species are composed of identical individuals with invariant traits and ignored the potentially important ecological roles of ontogenetic niche shifts. To bridge the gap, here I briefly review ecologically relevant examples which show that basic insights of species-based community theories can be revised by including the ontogenetic perspective. Specifically, I focus on the most representative animals in the study of ontogenetic niche shifts, i.e., fish, insects, and amphibians. Notably, their ontogenetic niche shifts create novel views of community structure: (1) ontogenetic diet shifts of predatory fish couple pelagic and benthic food webs in aquatic systems, (2) ontogenetic shifts in interaction types of pollinating insects couple herbivory and pollination networks in terrestrial systems, and (3) ontogenetic habitat shifts of amphibians and aquatic insects couple aquatic and terrestrial metacommunities at interface areas. Dynamic models of such stage-structured communities suggest that their ontogenetic niche shifts may affect the community resilience and disturbance responses. Exploring more complex systems (e.g., where many species undergo ontogenetic niche shifts several times or continuously) is a future direction, for which describing body size relationships between interacting organisms would be a promising approach. I conclude that both theoretical and empirical advances are needed to facilitate the ontogenetic perspective for better understanding mechanisms underlying biodiversity and ecosystem functioning which are increasingly threatened by anthropogenic disturbance.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1438-3896,1438-390X,,,,APR,2015,57,2,,,,,347,354,,10.1007/s10144-014-0448-z,,,,,,,WOS:000356776800011,,,,,,

However, how local species interactions scale-up to large spatial scales and how they contribute to shape species distributions and diversity patterns at macroecological extents remains less clear. Here, we provide an overview of recent and potential future developments in macroecology that explore the role of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among multiple species across trophic levels. Recent studies broadly represent two analytical methods (analyses of species richness and ecological networks) and provide evidence that plant-animal interactions (e.g. pollination, frugivory) and predator-prey interactions influence large-scale richness patterns and that ecological network structure varies systematically at macroscales. Current methodological problems and challenges are related to defining the functional links in cross-trophic richness analyses, understanding trait effects in multispecies interactions, and addressing sampling effects when analyzing multiple ecological networks across large spatial extents. Key topics for future research are 1) testing paleoclimatic imprints on interaction diversity, 2) understanding macroevolution and the phylogenetic structure of multispecies interactions, 3) quantifying contemporary spatial and temporal variability in complex ecological networks, and 4) predicting novel interactions under global change. Moreover, we see great potential for a deeper bidirectional integration of macroecology and network research, e.g. by analyses of trait complementarity and functional diversity of interacting groups and by employing species distribution modeling to predict changes in functional network structure. Addressing these key topics and achieving a better integration between these two research fields will significantly advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary drivers of multispecies interactions.

Nest webs'' are commensal networks that link secondary cavity-nesting vertebrates (e.g., bluebirds, ducks, and squirrels, which depend on tree cavities for nesting) with the excavators (e.g., woodpeckers) that produce cavities. In central British Columbia, Canada, Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus) is considered a keystone excavator, providing most cavities for secondary cavity-nesters. However, roles of species in the network, and overall network architecture, are expected to vary with population fluctuations. Many excavator species increased in abundance in association with a pulse of food (adult and larval beetles) during an outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), which peaked in 2003-2004. We studied nest-web dynamics from 1998 to 2011 to determine how network architecture changed during this resource pulse. Cavity availability increased at the onset of the beetle outbreak and peaked in 2005. During and after the outbreak, secondary cavity-nesters increased their use of cavities made by five species of beetle-eating excavators, and decreased their use of flicker cavities. We found low link turnover, with 74% of links conserved from year to year. Nevertheless, the network increased in evenness and diversity of interactions, and declined slightly in nestedness and niche overlap. These patterns remained evident seven years after the beetle outbreak, suggesting a legacy effect. In contrast to previous snapshot studies of nest webs, our dynamic approach reveals how the role of each cavity producer, and thus quantitative network architecture, can vary over time. The increase in interaction diversity with the beetle outbreak adds to growing evidence that insect outbreaks can increase components of biodiversity in forest ecosystems at various temporal scales. The observed changes in (quantitative) network architecture contrast with the relatively stable (qualitative) architecture of empirical mutualistic networks that have been studied to date. However, they are consistent with recent theory on the importance of population fluctuations in driving network architecture. Our results support the view that models should allow for the possibility of rewiring (species switching partners) to avoid overestimation of secondary extinction risk.",,,,,"Cockle, Kristina/0000-0002-6502-923X",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,APR,2015,96,4,,,,,1093,1104,,10.1890/14-1256.1,,,,,,,WOS:000353038200020,26230029,,,,,

We propose a conceptual scheme for studying the strength of plant-animal mutualistic interactions. We first review the interaction strength concepts developed for food webs, and explore how these concepts have been applied to mutualistic interactions. We then outline and explain a conceptual framework for defining ecological effects in plant-animal mutualisms. We give recommendations for measuring interaction strength from data collected in field studies based on a proposed approach for the assessment of interaction strength in plant-animal mutualisms.

Whilst many studies have shown elevational patterns in species richness and turnover, little is known about how food web structure is affected by elevation. Contrasting responses of predator and prey species to elevation may lead to changes in food web structure. We investigated how the quantitative structure of a herbivore-parasitoid food web changes with elevation in an Australian subtropical rain forest. On four occasions, spread over 1year, we hand-collected leaf miners at twelve sites, along three elevational gradients (between 493m and 1159m a.s.l). A total of 5030 insects, including 603 parasitoids, were reared, and summary food webs were created for each site. We also carried out a replicated manipulative experiment by translocating an abundant leaf-mining weevil Platynotocis sp., which largely escaped parasitism at high elevations (900m a.s.l.), to lower, warmer elevations, to test if it would experience higher parasitism pressure. We found strong evidence that the environmental change that occurs with increasing elevation affects food web structure. Quantitative measures of generality, vulnerability and interaction evenness decreased significantly with increasing elevation (and decreasing temperature), whilst elevation did not have a significant effect on connectance. Mined plant composition also had a significant effect on generality and vulnerability, but not on interaction evenness. Several relatively abundant species of leaf miner appeared to escape parasitism at higher elevations, but contrary to our prediction, Platynotocis sp. did not experience greater levels of parasitism when translocated to lower elevations. Our study indicates that leaf-mining herbivores and their parasitoids respond differently to environmental conditions imposed by elevation, thus producing structural changes in their food webs. Increasing temperatures and changes in vegetation communities that are likely to result from climate change may have a restructuring effect on host-parasitoid food webs. Our translocation experiment, however, indicated that leaf miners currently escaping parasitism at high elevations may not automatically experience higher parasitism under warmer conditions and future changes in food web structure may depend on the ability of parasitoids to adapt to novel hosts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,MAR,2015,84,2,,,,,353,363,,10.1111/1365-2656.12285,,,,,,,WOS:000349968700004,25244661,,,,,

Despite its potential generality, the PDC has been applied primarily to mountain streams of western North America. We tested the utility of the PDC as a conceptual framework for characterizing spatiotemporal variability in abiotic conditions and assessed the influence of process domains (PDs) on community composition of fishes and mussels along a fifth order river mainstem in the gulf coastal plain of the southeastern United States. We measured channel cross sections at three transects nested within three sites nested within three stream reaches to quantify multi-scale spatial variability in channel geomorphology along the mainstem of the Neches River, Texas, USA. Next, we modeled stage-dependent channel hydraulics to quantify temporal variability in habitat area and benthic disturbance. Lastly, we sampled fishes and mussels at each site and tested whether PDs correlate with spatial variation in taxonomic and functional community composition. Channel cross-sectional dimensions varied at the reach scale and affected the modeled temporal variability in habitat area and benthic disturbance. This interaction between channel geomorphology and disturbance regime indicated the presence of distinct PDs at the reach scale. Taxonomic composition of fishes did not differ among reaches, whereas abundance and richness of mussels were strongly reduced in the upper reach compared to the middle and lower reaches. Only slight differences in functional traits of fishes and mussels were apparent among reaches, suggesting that reach scale PDs do not influence community composition via the filtering of these functional traits. This study provides empirical evidence that the PDC is a useful framework for describing hydrogeomorphic conditions and mussel abundance and richness and can guide channel restorations in streams draining regions of low topography.

It is unclear, however, whether keystone species identity varies within a community type and what traits underlie this variation. Using a network biology approach, we assess whether keystone plant species vary across a metacommunity of five serpentine seeps in California and determine the features that predict their identity. We define keystone species as those with high strength, low node specialization index (NSI), and/or low d' and determine whether these parameters are predicted by floral traits (flower biomass, number of open flowers per plant, symmetry, or stamen number) and/or ecological features (variation in local floral abundance, endemism) within seeps and across the metacommunity. Keystone species identity varied among seeps and was associated with local flower abundance: mean floral abundance correlated positively with strength but negatively with NSI within most seeps as well as across the metacommunity. For the metacommunity, flower biomass correlated negatively with NSI while variation in flower abundance correlated negatively with strength. Across the metacommunity, the d' metric was associated with flower biomass, whereby plants with smaller flowers interacted with the most abundant pollinators across the metacommunity. Results suggest that connectance and interaction evenness may not be greatly influenced by community composition turnover due to substitution of keystone plant species across space.

This self-organization may lead to patterns in the allometric scaling of microbial community metabolism that differ from those of macrobial communities. Using meta-analyses, we analyzed the power scaling relationships between community production, respiration, extracellular enzyme activity and biomass for bacteria and fungi across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. The scaling exponents for community production versus biomass for fungi and bacteria were 0.85 +/- A 0.06 (95 % CI) and 0.72 +/- A 0.07, respectively. The scaling exponent for fungal respiration versus production was 0.61 +/- A 0.06. Previous studies reported exponents of 0.41, 0.44 and 0.58 for bacterial respiration versus production. Carbon use efficiency increased with biomass for both fungi and bacteria with an exponent of 0.27 +/- A 0.06. The potential activities of four widely measured extracellular enzymes were directly related to community production with power scaling exponents of 1.0-1.2. The frequency distribution of biomass turnover times (median 112 h for bacteria and 1,128 h for fungi) overlapped substantially with those for environmental substrate turnover, presented in a prior analysis of extracellular enzyme kinetics. These metabolic relationships, which have scaling exponents of 0.5, are linked by the ratio of assimilation to carbon use efficiency. This connection ties ecological stoichiometry and metabolic theory to microbial community homeostasis.

We continue on the theoretical path set by Nakajima and Higashi (1995, Indirect effects in ecological interaction networks (II): the conjugate variable approach. Mathematical Biosciences 130, 129-150) and extend their approach for quantifying indirect effects of press perturbations under steady-state conditions to pulse perturbations in steady state and to press and pulse perturbations under time-varying conditions. We illustrate with a commonly used lake ecosystem model how to estimate total, direct, and indirect effects on one species' biomass (e.g., game fish) from perturbations to a second species (e.g., forage fish). We use the daily output of species biomasses from multi-year model simulations to test whether the computed total, direct, and indirect effects are equal for pulse and press perturbations of equal magnitude, and whether the types (pulse and press) and timing of perturbations alter the relative importance of indirect effects. Our results were consistent with the original theory of Nakajima and Higashi; under steady-state conditions, press and pulse perturbations to the forage fish produced similar effects on the game fish. Under these same conditions, indirect effects on the game fish were more than 3.5 times larger than the direct effects. Under time-varying conditions, all classes of pulse effects, but not press, depended on the day the perturbation was imposed. Indirect effects of pulse and press perturbations under time-varying conditions were always negative (offsetting) and of similar magnitude as the direct effects. When forage fish biomass was growing rapidly, the indirect effect on game fish biomass of a pulse perturbation was relatively smaller compared to the direct effect, whereas the indirect and direct effects were similar at other times. We consider the general implications of these results for the analysis of natural ecosystems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

There is substantial variation in time taken to recover from chill coma both within and among species, and this variation is correlated with habitat temperatures such that insects from cold environments recover more quickly. This suggests an adaptive response, but the mechanisms underlying variation in recovery times are unknown, making it difficult to decisively test adaptive hypotheses. We use replicated lines of Drosophila melanogaster selected in the laboratory for fast (hardy) or slow (susceptible) chill-coma recovery times to investigate modifications to metabolic profiles associated with cold adaptation. We measured metabolite concentrations of flies before, during, and after cold exposure using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to test the hypotheses that hardy flies maintain metabolic homeostasis better during cold exposure and recovery, and that their metabolic networks are more robust to cold-induced perturbations. The metabolites of cold-hardy flies were less cold responsive and their metabolic networks during cold exposure were more robust, supporting our hypotheses. Metabolites involved in membrane lipid synthesis, tryptophan metabolism, oxidative stress, energy balance, and proline metabolism were altered by selection on cold tolerance.

LocationEastern Arc Mountains (EAM), Kenya and Tanzania. MethodsWe surveyed amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals during 2005-2009, targeting mountain blocks that had been poorly surveyed or unsurveyed by the early Noughties. We combined new and old data to produce a database of species presence by mountain block spanning four decades of research. Species richness is regressed against survey effort, funding, ecological and human disturbance factors to analyse the best predictors of vertebrate richness across mountain blocks. Similarity among species assemblages among blocks is analysed using dissimilarity analysis. ResultsNew surveys raised the number of endemic and regional endemic vertebrates by 24% (from 170 to 211 species), including 27 new species of which 23 are amphibians and reptiles. Vertebrate richness is best explained by forest area, but rainfall is also important, especially for amphibians and reptiles. Forest elevational range is important for mammals and for block-endemic birds. Funding explains 19% of the variation in total species richness, while survey effort generally explains <10% of variance. Cluster analysis shows that species assemblages are partitioned by geographical proximity among mountain blocks. Main conclusionsThe biological value of the EAM has been underestimated, and strategic surveys are important even in well-recognized hotspots.

Therefore, plant-frugivore interactions affect population dynamics and persistence in ecological communities. Plant-frugivore interactions often involve many species, forming networks of interacting plants and animals that play different roles in determining network organization. The network organization is the way interactions are structured in the community, which may have consequences for its ecological and evolutionary dynamics. Some species have greater influences on network organization and may be particularly important to species persistence. We identified the frugivores most important to the organization of networks of plants and frugivorous birds in three contiguous Atlantic forest sites in southeastern Brazil. We found that the species that contributed most to network organization were at higher risk of extinction. Among the main contributors to network organization were two cotingas and a toucan, large-bodied species that disperse seeds from many plants and are particularly vulnerable to habitat loss and hunting. As a consequence, ongoing extinctions may significantly affect the organization of plant-frugivore interactions in the studied system.

We found a significant positive relationship between RV and both forest bird richness and the average number of unique species (species represented by a single record) recorded at each site. Forest bird community composition was also significantly affected by RV. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between RV and forest cover, suggesting that road networks may impact biodiversity independently of changes in forest cover. However, variance partitioning analysis indicated that RV has partially independent and therefore additive effects, suggesting that RV and forest cover are best used in a complementary manner to investigate changes in biodiversity.

In the United States the U.S. Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program monitors the forested land base with field data collected over a permanent network of sample plots. Although these plots are visited repeatedly through time there are large temporal gaps (e.g. 5-10 years) between remeasurements such that many forest canopy disturbances go undetected. In this paper we demonstrate how Landsat time series (LTS) can help improve FIA's capacity to estimate disturbance by 1.) incorporating a new, downward looking response variable which is more sensitive to picking up change and 2.) providing historical disturbance maps which can reduce the variance of design-based estimates via post-stratification. To develop the LTS response variable a trained analyst was used to manually interpret 449 forested HA plots located in the Uinta Mountains of northern Utah, USA. This involved recording cause and timing of disturbances based on evidence gathered from a 26-year annual stack of Landsat images and an 18-year, periodically spaced set of high resolution (similar to 1 m) aerial photographs (e.g. National Aerial Image Program, NAIP and Google Earth). In general, the Landsat data captured major disturbances (e.g. harvests, fires) while the air photos allowed more detailed estimates of the number of trees impacted by recent insect outbreaks. Comparing the LTS and FIA field observations, we found that overall agreement was 73%, although when only disturbed plots were considered agreement dropped to 40%. Using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test, we compared distributions of live and disturbed tree size (height and DBH) and found that when LTS and FIA both found non-stand clearing disturbance the median disturbed tree size was significantly larger than undisturbed trees, whereas no significant difference was found on plots where only FIA detected disturbance. This suggests that LTS interpretation and FIA field crews both detect upper canopy disturbances while RA crews alone add disturbances occurring at or below canopy level. The analysis also showed that plots with only LTS disturbance had a significantly greater median number of years since last FIA measurement (6 years) than plots with both FIA and LTS disturbances (2.5 years), indicating that LTS improved detection on plots which had not been field sampled for several years. Next, to gauge the impact of incorporating LTS disturbances into the FIA estimation process we calculated design-based estimates of disturbance (for the period 1995-2011) using three response populations 1.) LTS observations, 2.) FIA field observations, and 3.) Combination of FIA and LTS observations. The results showed that combining the FIA and LTS observations led to the largest and most precise (i.e. smallest percent standard error) estimates of disturbance. In fact, the estimate based on the combined observations (486,458 ha, +/-47,101) was approximately 65% more than the estimate derived solely with FIA data (294,295 ha, +/-44,242). Lastly, a Landsat forest disturbance map was developed and tested for its ability to post-stratify the design-based estimates. Based on relative efficiency (RE), we found that stratification mostly improved the estimates derived with the LTS response data. Aside from insects (RE = 1. 26), the estimates of area affected by individual agents saw minimal gain, whereas the LTS and combined FIA + LTS estimates of total disturbance saw modest improvement, with REs of 1.43 and 1.50 respectively. Overall, our results successfully demonstrate two ways LTS can improve the completeness and precision of disturbance estimates derived from FIA inventory data.

We investigate how frugivore communities and seed dispersal change with habitat disturbance and test whether relationships between morphological traits and functional roles of seed dispersers change in response to human-induced forest edges. We recorded interaction frequencies between fleshy fruited plants and frugivorous bird species in tropical montane forests in the Bolivian Andes and recorded functional bird traits (body mass, gape width and wing tip length) associated with quantitative (seed-removal rate) and qualitative (seed-deposition pattern) components of seed-dispersal effectiveness. We found that the abundance and richness of frugivorous birds were higher at forest edges. More fruits were removed and dispersed seeds were less clustered at edges than in the interior. Additionally, functional and interaction diversity were higher at edges than in the interior, but functional and interaction evenness did not differ. Interaction strength of bird species increased with body mass, gape width and wing tip length in the forest interior, but was not related to bird morphologies at forest edges. Our study suggests that increases in functional and interaction diversity and an even distribution of interaction strength across bird morphologies lead to enhanced quantity and tentatively enhanced quality of seed dispersal.

However, disturbance should also affect spatial networks by altering habitat heterogeneity and resource availability. Variation in resource availability should perturb the frequency and nature of social and ecological interactions within a population by affecting the spatial distribution of individuals. In disturbed habitats where resources are limiting, spatial relationships should reflect behavioural differences among individuals, with higher-quality resources controlled by dominant individuals. In contrast, all individuals may exploit preferred resources in resource-rich habitats. Environmental variation and population reorganization may also result in variation in morphological, behavioural and ecological traits, which ultimately affect fitness. We addressed these considerations for male tree lizards (Urosaurus ornatus) at three sites that differ in levels of disturbance. The habitats at these localities differed in the availability of live trees, the preferred microhabitat of U.ornatus. In addition, male U.ornatus exhibits a polymorphism in dewlap colour linked with differences in aggression, which should influence their position in a network and access to resources. We applied a network framework to characterize the spatial organization of male morphs at each site and quantified male aggressive behaviour in the laboratory. We also compared body size, body condition, number of bite marks, parasite load and the microhabitat use and diet, of males among the sites. We detected no significant differences in spatial network structure between unburned and infrequently burned sites. However, at a frequently burned site, the network shifted towards geographically closer, heteromorphic male neighbour associations. Males at this site were also larger, more aggressive and had more bite marks but fewer parasites than males at the other sites. Moreover, we detected divergence in microhabitat use and diet among the morphs at the frequently burned site that reflected the shift in spatial network structure and differences in morph behaviour. That is, only more aggressive morphs usurped trees and consumed prey from higher trophic levels. We conclude that environmental variation may influence animal spatial network structure. Jointly, behavioural and environmental variation may promote despotic social dynamics and ecological divergence in resource-limited habitats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,NOV,2014,83,6,,,,,1490,1500,,10.1111/1365-2656.12252,,,,,,,WOS:000344339500025,24889087,,,,,

Long-term population persistence or population rescue require dispersal from other source populations. Barriers to movement can effectively fragment and isolate populations, reducing persistence and recolonisation. For stream organisms that depend heavily on movement within dendritic networks, research is needed to identify and estimate the effects of such barriers on connectivity. 2. We used capture-mark-recapture of displaced larval and adult salamanders to estimate return rates across gaps (length 13-85 m) in the riparian canopy and thus to assess the fragmentation of salamander populations within otherwise fully forested catchments. 3. Relative to salamanders in fully forested reaches, displaced salamanders were 86% less likely to return to their capture location when required to cross gaps in the canopy as short as 13 m, and the likelihood of return declined with increasing gap length. The effects of gaps on return rates were consistent among life stages and for up-and downstream movement. 4. Our study suggests that riparian disturbance can reduce permeability to salamanders, even in the absence of additional land-use change. Because anthropogenic features, such as roads and powerlines, frequently cross small streams, the accumulation of apparently small land-cover changes has the potential to reduce continuous populations to small fragments with limited connectivity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,NOV,2014,59,11,,,,,2354,2364,,10.1111/fwb.12439,,,,,,,WOS:000343047000012,,,,,,

Nevertheless, exotic species may also provide ecological insurance when they contribute to maintain ecosystem functions after the decline of native species following anthropogenic disturbance. Here, this hypothesis is tested with the assemblage of frugivorous birds and fleshy-fruited plants of New Zealand, which has suffered strong historical declines in native birds while simultaneously gaining new frugivores introduced by European settlers. We studied the plant-frugivore assemblage from measures of fruit and bird abundances and fruit consumption in nine forest patches, and tested how this changed across a gradient of relative abundance of exotic birds. We then examined how each bird species' role in the assemblage (the proportion of fruits and the number of plant species consumed) varied with their relative abundance, body size and native/exotic status. The more abundant and, to a lesser extent, larger birds species consumed a higher proportion of fruits from more plant species. Exotic birds consumed fruits less selectively and more proportionate to the local availability than did native species. Interaction networks in which exotic birds had a stronger role as frugivores had higher generalization, higher nestedness and higher redundancy of plants. Exotic birds maintained frugivory when native birds became rarer, and diversified the local spectrum of frugivores for co-occurring native plants. These effects seemed related to the fact that species abundances, rather than trait-matching constraints, ultimately determined the patterns of interactions between birds and plants. By altering the structure of plant-frugivore assemblages, exotic birds likely enhance the stability of the community-wide seed dispersal in the face of continued anthropogenic impact.",,,,"Garcia, Daniel/A-1236-2011; Stouffer, Daniel/C-2223-2008","Garcia, Daniel/0000-0002-7334-7836; Stouffer, Daniel/0000-0001-9436-9674",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,NOV,2014,83,6,,,,,1441,1450,,10.1111/1365-2656.12237,,,,,,,WOS:000344339500020,24749667,,,,,

Nonetheless, considerable heterogeneity exists in northern climate trends. We examined the roles of cryospheric landscape and lake depth in modulating the rate and magnitude of local climate responses through a paleolimnological study of lakes from southwest Yukon, Canada. By sampling lakes at varying distances from the Wrangell-St. Elias ice fields, we hypothesized that, for lakes of similar maximum depth, sites closest to the ice fields would be relatively complacent in terms of their chironomid and diatom assemblage changes over the past similar to 200 years. This hypothesis is based on the moderating effect of the glaciers on local climate, which would be most pronounced in the lakes nearest to the ice fields. However, given the known ecological differences between deep and shallow lakes, we further predicted that, for a given distance from the ice fields, a sediment record from a shallower lake would show the greatest change in stratigraphic subfossil assemblages. Because of the complicated shape of the ice fields, we applied the longitude for each site (which decreases from west to east) to approximate the proximity of our study lakes to the ice fields. Consistent with our predictions, we observed a space-transgressive pattern in the chironomid assemblage turnover that was associated with their proximity to the ice fields (r = -0.75, P = 0.034, n = 8) across lakes of similar depth (mean maximum depth +/- A 1, SE = 18.1 +/- A 2.6 m). Considering a broader network of lakes that represented a greater range in maximum depth (4.9-29 m), we found that differences in subfossil chironomid assemblages between the modern and ca. AD 1800 sediment layers were strongly related to lake depth (r = -0.77, P < 0.001, n = 15), but failed to detect a significant relationship with latitude or longitude (i.e. our proxy for proximity to the ice fields). Similarly, our comparative high-resolution analyses of two lakes with distinct lake morphometries, but similar proximities to the ice fields, demonstrated the predicted contrasting pattern: we observed pronounced post-1880 changes in the biotic assemblages in the shallow lake and a muted and delayed response (i.e. similar to 1970s) in the deeper lake. Our findings confirm that cryospheric landscape features can strongly modulate regional climate. Furthermore, our work shows that investigators need to be conscious of how climate change affects the structure and functioning of lakes of different typologies, which influences the way in which paleoclimate signals are recorded and interpreted.",,,,"Chen, Guangjie/J-3826-2017; Gregory-Eaves, Irene/U-9325-2019; Smol, John P/A-8838-2015","Chen, Guangjie/0000-0001-8035-6565; Gregory-Eaves, Irene/0000-0002-0380-5061; Botrel, Morgan/0000-0001-6313-8996; Smol, John/0000-0002-2499-6696; Sweetman, Jon/0000-0002-9849-7355",,,,,,,,,,,,0921-2728,1573-0417,,,,OCT,2014,52,3,,,,,185,200,,10.1007/s10933-014-9787-1,,,,,,,WOS:000342338700005,,,,,,

Projected changes in climate will likely exacerbate this situation. Using species distribution models, we assess possible future changes in the diversity and climatic niche size of an unprecedented number of species for the region. We modeled a broad range of taxa (11,012 species of birds and vascular plants), including both endemic and widespread species and provide a comprehensive estimation of climate change impacts on the Andes. We find that if no dispersal is assumed, by 2050s, more than 50% of the species studied are projected to undergo reductions of at least 45% in their climatic niche, whilst 10% of species could be extinct. Even assuming unlimited dispersal, most of the Andean endemics (comprising similar to 5% of our dataset) would become severely threatened (>50% climatic niche loss). While some areas appear to be climatically stable (e.g. Pichincha and Imbabura in Ecuador; and Narino, Cauca, Valle del Cauca and Putumayo in Colombia) and hence depict little diversity loss and/or potential species gains, major negative impacts were also observed. Tropical high Andean grasslands (paramos and punas) and evergreen montane forests, two key ecosystems for the provision of environmental services in the region, are projected to experience negative changes in species richness and high rates of species turnover. Adapting to these impacts would require a landscape-network based approach to conservation, including protected areas, their buffer zones and corridors. A central aspect of such network is the implementation of an integrated landscape management approach based on sustainable management and restoration practices covering wider areas than currently contemplated.

We estimate the relative vulnerability of selected marine-ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico through simulation experiments based on trophic models. The same perturbation pattern was applied to different functional groups at different trophic levels. Perturbation consisted of increasing biomass extraction for a single group up to 98% at a constant rate over 50 years. The ratio Ascendency to Capacity of Development, A/C, was estimated as a measure of ecosystem order. The maximum negative difference respect to the initial A/C represents the gain of entropy. The slope of the relationship between entropy gained and the trophic level provides an estimate of the relative vulnerability of the ecosystem. This was applied to five ecosystems in the Gulf of Mexico: Florida coral reef; Mexican coastal lagoon, Terminos Lagoon; and three continental shelves, the northern Gulf of Mexico, USA; Yucatan and the Campeche Sound, Mexico. The pattern of vulnerability among ecosystems is related to ecosystem complexity. The coral reef exhibited a lower slope, corresponding to higher vulnerability, which is related to higher connectivity, production efficiency, and net ecosystem production. Increasingly higher slopes, corresponding to lower vulnerability, followed a gradient from the coral reef to the continental shelves to the least vulnerable system, the coastal lagoon. Middle trophic levels contribute to higher vulnerability. This interpretation is supported by the concept of energy flows within trophic networks. The relevance of these findings for management is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This took place in grasslands on the east coast of South Africa, and was done at four paired sites using ten replicates at each of the eight sites. Pairwise comparisons (EN vs. PA) of plant species composition yielded statistically smaller differences than comparisons between different pairs of sites within either the EN or PA, illustrating considerable turnover of species whether or not they were in an EN or PA. Overall, there were fewer plant species in the EN for three of the four pairs of sites. Nevertheless, plant species composition was similar in each pair of sites. The grassland EN was also characterized by greater maximum vegetation height and less green vegetation cover. When differences between the EN and a PA were viewed against the natural variation of abiotic and biotic conditions across the landscape, they were small.

Here we address biological invasions on species-rich food webs. We performed in silico experiments on empirical vertebrate food webs by introducing virtual species characterised by different ecological roles and belonging to different trophic groups. We varied a number of invasive species traits, including their diet breadth, the number of predators attacking them, and the bioenergetic thresholds below which invader and native species become extinct. We found that simpler food webs were more vulnerable to invasions, and that relatively less connected mammals were the most successful invaders. Invasions altered food web structure by decreasing species richness and the number of links per species, with most extinctions affecting poorly connected birds.

Using the live-bearing Atlantic molly (Poecilia mexicana), a species with pronounced male size polymorphism, we investigated social network dynamics of mixed sex experimental groups consisting of eight females and three different-sized males over a period of 5 days. Analyzing association-based social networks as well as direct measures of spatial proximity, we found that large males tended to monopolize most females, while excluding small- and medium-bodied males from access to females. This effect, however, emerged only gradually over time, and different-sized males had equal access to females on day 1 as well as day 2, though to a lesser extent.

Neither the fruit size of plant nor the body mass of frugivore communities differed between natural forest sites and forest fragments. Moreover, in-depth analyses of frugivore assemblages visiting plant species revealed no effect of forest category on the number of frugivore visits or their mean body mass. The number of visits and body mass of frugivores were merely determined by the crop and fruit size of the focal plant species.

Connectivity can therefore shape trophic interactions, but little empirical evidence is available, especially for large mammals. In forest ecosystems, logging alters functional connectivity among habitat patches, and such activities can affect the spatial game between large herbivores and their predators. We used graph theory to evaluate how harvesting-induced changes in habitat connectivity influence patch choice and residency time of GPS-collared caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) and moose (Alces alces) in winter in the boreal forest. We then investigated the predator-prey game by assessing how GPS-collared wolves (Canis lupus) adjusted their movements to changes in landscape properties and in the networks of their prey species. We built prey habitat networks using minimum planar graphs organized around species-specific, highly selected habitat patches (i.e., network nodes). We found that spatial dynamics of large herbivores were influenced not only by the intrinsic quality of habitat patches, but also by the connectivity of those network nodes. Caribou and moose selected nodes that were connected by a high number of links, and moose also spent relatively more time in those nodes. By limiting node accessibility, human disturbances influenced travel decisions. Caribou and moose avoided nodes that were surrounded by a high proportion of cuts and roads, but once within these nodes, moose stayed longer than in other nodes. Caribou selectively moved among nodes with low distance costs, and their residency time increased with distance costs required to reach the nodes. Wolves selected their prey's nodes, where vegetation consumed by caribou and moose was highly abundant. Furthermore, wolves discriminated among those nodes by selecting the most connected ones. In fact, selection by wolves was stronger for their prey's nodes than for the prey's utilization distribution per se, a difference that increased with the level of human disturbance. Considering the difficulty of keeping track of highly mobile prey, predators may benefit by targeting not only their prey's resource patches, but also the most highly connected patches. Matrix quality and connectivity are therefore key elements shaping the predator-prey spatial game in human-altered landscapes because of their impact on the spatial dynamics of the interacting species.",,,,"Fortin, Daniel/ABG-3554-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9615,1557-7015,,,,MAY,2014,84,2,,,,,265,285,,10.1890/12-2118.1,,,,,,,WOS:000335859700004,,,,,,

Bird surveys of fixed time and area in 25 rainforest fragments (1-139 ha in size across a 1800 km(2) region) provided bird assemblage data which were coupled with prior knowledge of bird species' particular roles in seed dispersal to give measurements of seven different attributes of the seed disperser assemblage. We used multimodel regression to assess how patch size and surrounding forest cover (within 200 m, 1000 m, and 5000 m radii) influenced variation in the abundance of individual bird species and of functional groups based on bird species' responses to fragmentation and their roles in seed dispersal. Surrounding forest cover, specifically rainforest cover, generally had a greater effect on frugivorous bird assemblages than fragment size. Amount of rainforest cover within 200 m of fragments was the main factor positively associated with abundances of frugivorous birds that are both fragmentation sensitive and important seed dispersers. Our results suggest a high proportion of local rainforest cover is required for the persistence of seed-dispersing birds and the maintenance of seed dispersal processes. Thus, even small rainforest fragments can function as important parts of habitat networks for seed-dispersing birds, whether or not they are physically connected by vegetation. Respuestas de Aves Dispersoras de Semillas al Incremento de Selvas en el Paisaje Alrededor de Fragmentos Resumen La perdida de habitat y la fragmentacion alteran la composicion del ensamblaje de aves en la selva. Ya que las aves son el principal dispersor de semillas en las selvas, los cambios inducidos por la fragmentacion al ensamblaje de aves frugivoras probablemente tambien alteren los procesos ecologicos de la dispersion de semillas y la regeneracion de bosques, pero la naturaleza especifica de estos cambios es entendida pobremente. Estudiamos la influencia del tamano de fragmento y la cobertura de bosque en el paisaje sobre la abundancia, la composicion de especies y las propiedades funcionales de la comunidad de especies de aves dispersoras de semillas en un paisaje despejado extensivamente y previamente de selva en Australia subtropical. Los censos de aves en un tiempo y area fijos en 25 fragmentos de selva (1 - 139 ha de tamano a lo largo de una region de 1 800 Km(2)) proporcionaron datos de ensamblaje de aves que se parearon con el conocimiento previo de los papeles particulares de las especies de aves en la dispersion de semillas para dar medidas de siete atributos diferentes del ensamblaje del dispersor de semillas. Usamos una regresion multi-modelo para estudiar como el tamano de fragmento y la cobertura de bosque proxima (dentro de 200 m, 1000 m y 5000 m de radio) influyeron en la variacion de la abundancia de especies individuales de aves y de los grupos funcionales basados en las respuestas de las especies de aves a la fragmentacion y su papel en la dispersion de semillas. La cobertura forestal proxima, especificamente la cobertura de selva, en general tuvo un mayor efecto sobre el ensamblaje de aves frugivoras que el tamano del fragmento. El incremento de la cobertura de selva dentro de los 200 m de fragmentos fue el factor principal asociado positivamente con las abundancias de aves frugivoras que son sensibles a la fragmentacion y dispersores importantes de semillas. Nuestros resultados sugieren que se requiere una alta proporcion de cobertura local de selva para la persistencia de aves dispersoras y el mantenimiento del proceso de dispersion de semillas. Asi, hasta el mas minimo fragmento de selva puede funcionar como parte importante de una red de habitats para aves dispersoras, esten o no conectadas fisicamente por la vegetacion.",,,,"Catterall, Carla P/K-7996-2017","Catterall, Carla P/0000-0002-1914-0455",,,,,,,,,,,,0888-8892,1523-1739,,,,APR,2014,28,2,,,,,551,560,,10.1111/cobi.12236,,,,,,,WOS:000332923500026,24548306,,,,,

They are not distributed uniformly in the environment, and their activity, abundance, and ecosystem functioning could vary across localities, characterized by high beta-diversity. Investigating factors that contribute to high beta-diversity can help infer the possible mechanisms of microbial community assembly, and predict the scale and extent of impacts that soil microbes have on the plant community. Because soil systems consist of multiple horizons (i.e., vertical stratification) associated with different soil properties, complete understanding of high beta-diversity requires consideration of both horizontal and vertical spatial structures of soil microbial communities. We studied the community composition of soil fungi from the O- and A-horizons in a Castanopsis-dominated temperate forest, and compared horizontal spatial autocorrelation in species composition between the two soil horizons (O- versus A-horizons). Pyrosequencing analysis yielded 67,129 sequencing reads, summed across all the 48 forest soil samples. Clustering analysis resulted in 597 molecular operational taxonomic units (OTUs), 68 % of which were identified as fungi, represented by four phyla. The Mantel test revealed that the O-horizon communities are spatially clustered, and the observed high beta-diversity was driven not only by changes in OTUs present, but also by high turnover in identities of OTUs in soil samples. Furthermore, Mantel correlogram analysis showed that the O-horizon communities resembled each other in composition within the range of 50 m, whereas the A-horizon communities lacked such horizontal autocorrelation. These differences in the scale patchiness could arise from two processes: (1) that environmental conditions could show higher heterogeneity in finer scale at the A-horizon than at the O-horizon; and/or (2) dispersal could be more frequent at the O-horizon than the A-horizon. The present study suggests that either environmental filtering (i.e., the niche-based process) or dispersal limitation (i.e., neutral process) could characterize the observed patterns of spatial clustering in the soil fungal community.",,,,"Sato, Hirotoshi/A-2429-2015; Toju, Hirokazu/T-7355-2019; Toju, Hirokazu/S-7307-2017; Kadowaki, Kohmei/K-8117-2019; Tanabe, Akifumi/P-9381-2015","Toju, Hirokazu/0000-0002-3362-3285; Kadowaki, Kohmei/0000-0003-0512-1621; Tanabe, Akifumi/0000-0003-1017-6504",,,,,,,,,,,,1438-3896,1438-390X,,,,APR,2014,56,2,,,,,301,310,,10.1007/s10144-013-0424-z,,,,,,,WOS:000333352500005,,,,,,

Large, dominant stands can derail efforts to restore wetland ecosystems degraded by other stressors. To be proactive, landscape-level management of Phragmites requires information on the current spatial distribution of the species and a characterization of areas suitable for future colonization. Using a recent basin-scale map of this invasive plant's distribution in the U.S. coastal zone of the Great Lakes, environmental data (e. g., soils, nutrients, disturbance, climate, topography), and climate predictions, we performed analyses of current and predicted suitable coastal habitat using boosted regression trees, a type of species distribution modeling. We also investigated differential influences of environmental variables in the upper lakes (Lakes Superior, Michigan, and Huron) and lower lakes (Lakes St. Clair, Erie, and Ontario). Basin-wide results showed that the coastal areas most vulnerable to Phragmites expansion were in close proximity to developed lands and had minimal topographic relief, poorly drained soils, and dense road networks. Elevated nutrients and proximity to agriculture also influenced the distribution of Phragmites. Climate predictions indicated an increase in suitable habitat in coastal Lakes Huron and Michigan in particular.

We propose a conceptual framework for including the likely impacts of a changing climate on marine connectivity, and synthesize information on the relationships between changing ocean temperature and acidification, connectivity and conservation tools. Our framework relies on concepts of functional connectivity, which depends on an organism's biological and behavioral responses to the physical environment, and structural connectivity, which describes changes in the physical and spatial structure of the environment that affect connectivity and movement. Our review confirms that ocean climate change likely reduces potential dispersal distance and therefore functional connectivity. Structural connectivity in the ocean will inevitably change with the spatial arrangement of biogenic habitats resulting from disturbance as well as enhanced growth and mortality due to climate change. Climate change will also likely reduce the spatial scale of connectivity, suggesting that we will need more closely spaced protected areas.",,,,"O'Connor, Mary/R-2933-2019; O'Connor, Mary I/F-2275-2010","O'Connor, Mary/0000-0001-9583-1592; ",,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,MAR,2014,5,3,,,,,,,33,10.1890/ES13-00336.1,,,,,,,WOS:000333797600010,,,,,,

To assess effects of these changes on associated biotic communities it is necessary to monitor and report on the status of lotic ecosystems. A variety of stream classification methods are available to assist with these tasks, and such methods attempt to provide a systematic approach to modeling and understanding complex aquatic systems at various spatial and temporal scales. Of the vast number of approaches that exist, it is useful to group them into three main types. The first involves modeling longitudinal species turnover patterns within large drainage basins and relating these patterns to environmental predictors collected at reach and upstream catchment scales; the second uses regionalized hierarchical classification to create multi-scale, spatially homogenous aquatic ecoregions by grouping adjacent catchments together based on environmental similarities; and the third approach groups sites together on the basis of similarities in their environmental conditions both within and between catchments, independent of their geographic location. We review the literature with a focus on more recent classifications to examine the strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches.

At the same time, the species position within food webs or mutualistic networks (e. g. generalist or specialist, network hub or peripheral vertex) may affect their ability to persist after perturbations. This study was conducted in a heavily managed boreal forest landscape in southeastern Norway, using study plots situated in forest stands with contrasting disturbance history: old growth forest (least disturbed), young forest (intermediate) and clear cuts (most disturbed). By studying 12 pollination networks with contrasting disturbance history we found that important network descriptors were conserved after perturbation. Link-diversity was higher, both overall and per site, in the more disturbed communities while link-turnover was highest in the least disturbed community. We conclude that despite an increase in diversity in the more degraded habitat, the higher link-turnover in the least degraded, old growth forest, community indicates a homogenization of the plant-pollinator networks as a result of habitat degradation. Finally, we found that the degree (number of interacting partners) and network functional role for particular species changed along the disturbance gradient, though not in any systematic way.

This is in large part because analytical approaches such as network theory have only recently been applied to characterize complex community dynamics. Network models are a powerful tool for quantifying how ecological interactions are affected by habitat modification because they provide metrics that quantify community structure and function. Here, we examine how large-scale habitat alteration has affected ecological interactions among mixed-species flocking birds in Amazonian rainforest. These flocks provide a model system for investigating how habitat heterogeneity influences non-trophic interactions and the subsequent social structure of forest-dependent mixed-species bird flocks. We analyse 21 flock interaction networks throughout a mosaic of primary forest, fragments of varying sizes and secondary forest (SF) at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project in central Amazonian Brazil. Habitat type had a strong effect on network structure at the levels of both species and flock. Frequency of associations among species, as summarized by weighted degree, declined with increasing levels of forest fragmentation and SF. At the flock level, clustering coefficients and overall attendance positively correlated with mean vegetation height, indicating a strong effect of habitat structure on flock cohesion and stability. Prior research has shown that trophic interactions are often resilient to large-scale changes in habitat structure because species are ecologically redundant. By contrast, our results suggest that behavioural interactions and the structure of non-trophic networks are highly sensitive to environmental change. Thus, a more nuanced, system-by-system approach may be needed when thinking about the resiliency of ecological networks.",,,,"Ryder, Thomas Brandt/G-1868-2010; stouffer, phil/AAF-7281-2020; Cortes, Marina Correa/I-2155-2012","Ryder, Thomas Brandt/0000-0002-5517-6607; Cortes, Marina Correa/0000-0003-3389-5050; Wolfe, Jared/0000-0001-5575-086X",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-8452,1471-2954,,,,FEB 7,2014,281,1776,,,,,,,20132599,10.1098/rspb.2013.2599,,,,,,,WOS:000332381500013,24335983,,,,,

Anthropogenic disturbance may alter these species interactions, but the extent to which structural changes to plant-pollinator networks affect plant species mating systems is not well understood. We used long-term livestock grazing of a birch wood ecosystem to test whether disturbance of this semi-natural habitat altered floral resources, the structure of plant-insect visitation networks and the mating system of a focal plant species, Cirsium palustre. Grazed habitat had a higher species richness of floral resources for pollinators. Visitation networks in grazed habitats were larger, more diverse, with an increase in the number of pollinators per plant species. Controlling for sampling effects, however, showed networks in grazed habitats were less nested and revealed a positive correlation between network connectance and floral species richness. Network connectance was negatively related to C.palustre outcrossing rate within grazed and ungrazed sites. However, on average, the effects of grazing, including greater mean connectance, produced higher overall outcrossing rates and more pollen donors compared with ungrazed habitat. The number of different pollen donors, spatial genetic structure and mating among close relatives were all correlated with greater extent of suitable C.palustre habitat in the landscape, consistent with the effects of increasing plant population size but limited seed dispersal. Pre-adaptation of C.palustre to disturbance coupled with a preponderance of highly dispersive flies attracted to the greater food resources in grazed habitat is a likely mechanism underpinning this increased pollen transport. Habitat modification by long-term mammalian grazing fundamentally shifted visitation network structure and the state of a plant mating system, indicating how ecosystem disturbance can cascade across levels of biological organization through altered interspecific interactions. Cirsium palustre retains flexibility to bias reproduction towards selfing where pollen donor diversity is limited; such reproductive flexibility may be an important mechanism structuring plant populations in human-modified landscapes.",,,,"Pywell, Richard F/E-8738-2010; Chapman, Daniel S/C-2900-2008; Cavers, Stephen/B-7806-2010; Woodcock, Benjamin Alex/F-9199-2010; Chapman, Daniel/O-5100-2019; Perry, Annika/F-6784-2014; Gray, Alan/AAL-1769-2020; Vanbergen, Adam J./I-6863-2012","Pywell, Richard F/0000-0001-6431-9959; Chapman, Daniel S/0000-0003-1836-4112; Cavers, Stephen/0000-0003-2139-9236; Woodcock, Benjamin Alex/0000-0003-0300-9951; Chapman, Daniel/0000-0003-1836-4112; Perry, Annika/0000-0002-7889-7597; Gray, Alan/0000-0002-6785-0590; Vanbergen, Adam J./0000-0001-8320-5535",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,FEB,2014,28,1,,,SI,,178,189,,10.1111/1365-2435.12191,,,,,,,WOS:000331083900018,,,,,,

LocationTemperate woodland in southern NSW, Australia. MethodsGeneralized linear models (GLMs) were used to investigate the factors that influence the occurrence and density of the study species in roadsides. Akaike's information criterion (AIC) was used to determine the relative importance of biophysical, disturbance and landscape variables in predictive models for the two species. ResultsWe identified two significant determinants of the occurrence of B.populneus and S.molle populations in roadsides: (1) the presence of large perch' trees of non-target species (predominately Eucalyptus spp.) in roadsides and (2) distance to nearest paddock tree of each target species. These factors were important for both species, but combined to form a stronger predictive model for S.molle than for B.populneus. Factors influencing population density were less clear, although populations of both species tended to be denser on narrow roads. Main conclusionsLarge perch trees were an important predictor of the presence of roadside populations of both species. These results provide criteria to enable roadside managers to either promote native B.populneus, or prevent incursions of exotic S.molle, as desired. Examination of the dispersal pathways for B.populneus and S.molle has revealed that in fragmented agricultural landscapes, isolated paddock trees are able to disperse to nearby roadside environments via frugivore activity.

Many boreal systems have limited anthropogenic disturbances and are preserved, in effect, to date largely by their harsh climates and remoteness. As of 2011, almost 10% of Canada is subject to some manner of formal protection, with 4.5% of this protected area found within the boreal zone. The management of existing parks and protected areas (PPAs) is shared amongst many federal, provincial, and territorial jurisdictions. Although there are currently low levels of anthropogenic development in some portions of the boreal zone (especially the north), if expansion of protected areas is of interest, there are challenges to traditional PPA networks that may be more prominent in the boreal zone than elsewhere: (1) the boreal zone is home to charismatic mammal species with area requirements much larger than typical PPAs; (2) the boreal zone is characterized by natural disturbance regimes that impact large areas; and (3) projected changes to climate for the boreal zone are among the greatest in the world, creating temporal considerations for conservation planning exercises. There is currently no PPA assessment specific to boreal Canada. To address this lack of an assessment, we developed a conservation gap analysis of the current PPA system with respect to a variety of environmental surrogates (ecozones, land cover, vegetation productivity, and landscape structure). The amount of formally protected land varied within each surrogate, with few commonly reported features meeting national or international conservation targets. Furthermore, few reserves met the areal requirements that have been previously recommended to protect large mammals or accommodate the disturbance regimes present. We also discuss considerations and implications of area-based versus value-based protection objectives. While recognizing that there are still scientific challenges around understanding and evaluating the effectiveness of PPAs, based upon our review and assessment, the following considerations should inform conservation options for the boreal zone: (1) representation of the distribution of natural features within the PPA network; (2) effective maintenance of habitat requirements and spatial resilience to both cyclical and directional changes in spatial patterns through large, connected reserves; and (3) implementation of sustainable forest management practices (where applicable) throughout the broader landscape, as traditional on-reserve protection is unlikely to be sufficient to meet conservation goals. The Canadian boreal is unique in possessing large tracts of inaccessible forested lands that are not subject to management interventions, thereby offering functions similar to protected lands. The question of how to more formally integrate these lands into the existing PPA network requires further consideration. Further, the important temporal role of landscape dynamics in designing an effective PPA needs to be further studied as well as development of a better understanding of design needs in the context of a changing climate.",,,,"Wulder, Michael A/J-5597-2016","Wulder, Michael A/0000-0002-6942-1896; Andrew, Margaret/0000-0003-3285-3684; Cardille, Jeffrey/0000-0002-4667-9085",,,,,,,,,,,,1208-6053,1181-8700,,,,,2014,22,2,,,,,135,160,,10.1139/er-2013-0056,,,,,,,WOS:000337104900003,,,,,,

One way to compensate losses is biodiversity offsetting (wherein biodiversity impacted is replaced through restoration elsewhere). A challenge in implementing offsets, which has received scant attention in the literature, is the accurate determination of residual biodiversity losses. We explore this challenge for offsetting gas extraction in the Ustyurt Plateau, Uzbekistan. Our goal was to determine the landscape extent of habitat impacts, particularly how the footprint of linear infrastructure (i.e. roads, pipelines), often disregarded in compensation calculations, compares with hub infrastructure (i.e. extraction facilities). We measured vegetation cover and plant species richness using the line-intercept method, along transects running from infrastructure/control sites outward for 500m, accounting for wind direction to identify dust deposition impacts. Findings from 24 transects were extrapolated to the broader plateau by mapping total landscape infrastructure network using GPS data and satellite imagery. Vegetation cover and species richness were significantly lower at development sites than controls. These differences disappeared within 25m of the edge of the area physically occupied by infrastructure. The current habitat footprint of gas infrastructure is 220 +/- 19km(2) across the Ustyurt (total similar to 100,000km(2)), 37 +/- 6% of which is linear infrastructure. Vegetation impacts diminish rapidly with increasing distance from infrastructure, and localized dust deposition does not conspicuously extend the disturbance footprint. Habitat losses from gas extraction infrastructure cover 0.2% of the study area, but this reflects directly eliminated vegetation only. Impacts upon fauna pose a more difficult determination, as these require accounting for behavioral and demographic responses to disturbance by elusive mammals, including threatened species. This study demonstrates that impacts of linear infrastructure in regions such as the Ustyurt should be accounted for not just with respect to development sites but also associated transportation and delivery routes.",,,,"Bull, Joseph/O-7578-2015","Bull, Joseph/0000-0001-7337-8977; Esipov, Alexander/0000-0001-8239-539X; Jones, Isabel/0000-0002-8361-1370",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,JAN,2014,4,1,,,,,79,90,,10.1002/ece3.884,,,,,,,WOS:000329183100008,24455163,,,,,

However, for robust inference on occupancy and related parameters, we must account for detection errors, a commonly overlooked problem that leads to biased estimates and misleading conclusions about population dynamics. Here, we provide direct empirical evidence of the effects of different environmental variables on the extinction and colonization rates of a rich butterfly community in the western Mediterranean. The analysis was based on a 17-year data set containing detection/nondetection data on 73 butterfly species for 26 sites in north-eastern Spain. Using multiseason occupancy models, which take into account species' detectability, we were able to obtain robust estimates of local extinction and colonization probabilities for each species and test the potential effects of site covariates such as the area of suitable habitat, topographic variability, landscape permeability around the site and climatic variability in aridity conditions. Results revealed a general pattern across species with local habitat composition and landscape features as stronger predictors of occupancy dynamics compared with topography and local aridity. Increasing area of suitable habitat in a site strongly decreased local extinction risks and, for a number of species, both higher amounts of suitable habitat and more permeable landscapes increased colonization rates. Nevertheless, increased topographic variability decreased the extinction risk of bad dispersers, a group of species with significantly lower colonization rates. Our models predicted higher sensitivity of the butterfly assemblages to deterministic changes in habitat features rather than to stochastic weather patterns, with some relationships being clearly dependent on the species' traits.",,,,"Turco, Marco/B-5814-2011; Oro, Daniel/H-4208-2012; Genovart, Meritxell/L-4873-2014; Nichols, James/AAG-1500-2019","Turco, Marco/0000-0001-8589-7459; Oro, Daniel/0000-0003-4782-3007; Genovart, Meritxell/0000-0003-2919-1288; Fernandez-Chacon, Albert/0000-0003-4105-0090",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JAN,2014,83,1,,,,,276,285,,10.1111/1365-2656.12118,,,,,,,WOS:000328615300028,23957287,,,,,

Following the exposure to MCLR and MCRR, gills, liver, intestine, and brain tissues were harvested for metabolite extraction. Extracted metabolites were detected using qTOF-LC-MS (time-of-flight-liquid chromatography mass spectrometry). Metabolites were identified using Kegg pathways. The identified metabolites are shown on lipid biochemical maps to demonstrate major perturbations in the metabolic machinery. Results showed that most of the metabolic pathways under the lipid class were affected in different tissues of zebrafish following the exposure to MCLR and MCRR (10 mu g L-1 for 30 days). The kind and flux of metabolic perturbations varied among different tissues of the organs after the exposure to MCLR and MCRR with the tissues of gills being the most affected. Among the various lipid pathways, cholesterol synthesis was affected significantly as observed from the highest number of perturbed metabolites in that pathway. Cholesterol is responsible for synthesis of steroid hormones and bile acids, which have been recognized as endocrine signaling molecules. Disruption in the synthesis of these compounds following MCLR/MCRR exposure suggests that MCs are capable of causing endocrine disruption among aquatic organisms even under sublethal conditions.

Microbe-host symbiotic associations are poorly explored in comparison with other species interaction networks. The current paradigm on symbiosis research stems from species-poor systems where pairwise and reciprocally specialized interactions between a single microbe and a single host that coevolve are the norm. These symbioses involving just a few species are fascinating in their own right, but more diverse and complex host-associated microbial communities are increasingly found, with new emerging questions that require new paradigms and approaches. Here we adopt an intermediate complexity approach to study the specificity, phylogenetic community structure, and temporal variability of the subset of the most abundant bacteria associated with different sponge host species with diverse eco-evolutionary characteristics. We do so by using a monthly resolved annual temporal series of host-associated and free-living bacteria. Bacteria are very abundant and diverse within marine sponges, and these symbiotic interactions are hypothesized to have a very ancient origin. We show that host-bacteria reciprocal specialization depends on the temporal scale and level of taxonomic aggregation considered. Sponge hosts with similar eco-evolutionary characteristics (e.g., volume of tissue corresponding to microbes, water filtering rates, and microbial transmission type) have similar bacterial phylogenetic community structure when looking at interactions aggregated over time. In general, sponge hosts hypothesized to form more intricate relationships with bacteria show a remarkably persistent bacterial community over time. Other hosts, however, show a large turnover similar to that observed for free-living bacterioplankton.

This article examines Islas Choros-Damas Marine Reserve, a small marine protected area located in a highly productive and biologically diverse coastal marine ecosystem in northern Chile, and the interactions between human, institutional, and ecological dimensions beyond those existing within its boundaries. Through documents analysis, surveys, and interviews, we described marine reserve implementation (governing system) and the social and natural ecosystem-to-be-governed. We analyzed the interactions and the connections between the marine reserve and other spatially explicit conservation and/or management measures existing in the area and influencing management outcomes and governance. A top-down approach with poor stakeholder involvement characterized the implementation process. The marine reserve is highly connected with other spatially explicit measures and with a wider social-ecological system through various ecological processes and socio-economic interactions. Current institutional interactions with positive effects on the management and governance are scarce, although several potential interactions may be developed. For the study area, any management action must recognize interferences from outside conditions and consider some of them (e.g., ecotourism management) as cross-cutting actions for the entire social-ecological system. We consider that institutional interactions and the development of social networks are opportunities to any collective effort aiming to improve governance of Islas Choros-Damas marine reserve. Communication of connections and interactions between marine protected areas and the wider social-ecological system (as described in this study) is proposed as a strategy to improve stakeholder participation in Chilean marine protected areas.",,,,"Carcamo, P.

At the same time, habitat fragmentation may impose strong natural selection and lead to evolution of life histories with possible consequences for demographic dynamics. The Baltic populations of the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) inhabit regions with highly fragmented habitat (networks of small dry meadows) as well as regions with extensive continuous habitat (calcareous alvar grasslands). Here, we report the results of common garden studies on butterflies originating from two highly fragmented landscapes (FL) in Finland and Sweden and from two continuous landscapes (CL) in Sweden and Estonia, conducted in a large outdoor cage (32 by 26m) and in the laboratory. We investigated a comprehensive set of 51 life-history traits, including measures of larval growth and development, flight performance, and adult reproductive behavior. Seventeen of the 51 traits showed a significant difference between fragmented versus CL. Most notably, the growth rate of postdiapause larvae and several measures of flight capacity, including flight metabolic rate, were higher in butterflies from fragmented than CL. Females from CL had shorter intervals between consecutive egg clutches and somewhat higher life-time egg production, but shorter longevity, than females from FL. These results are likely to reflect the constant opportunities for oviposition in females living in continuous habitats, while the more dispersive females from FL allocate more resources to dispersal capacity at the cost of egg maturation rate. This study supports theoretical predictions about small population sizes and high rate of population turnover in fragmented habitats selecting for increased rate of dispersal, but the results also indicate that many other life-history traits apart from dispersal are affected by the degree of habitat fragmentation.",,,,"Duplouy, Anne/H-3006-2019","Duplouy, Anne/0000-0002-7147-5199",,,,,,,,,,,,2045-7758,,,,,DEC,2013,3,16,,,,,5141,5156,,10.1002/ece3.885,,,,,,,WOS:000328672600002,24455144,,,,,

One key question is whether existing protected area networks will remain effective in a changing climate. To test this, we developed statistical models that link climate to the abundance of internationally important bird populations in northwestern Europe. Spatial climate-abundance models were able to predict 56% of the variation in recent 30-year population trends. Using these models, future climate change resulting in 4.0 degrees C global warming was projected to cause declines of at least 25% for more than half of the internationally important populations considered. Nonetheless, most EU Special Protection Areas in the UK were projected to retain species in sufficient abundances to maintain their legal status, and generally sites that are important now were projected to be important in the future. The biological and legal resilience of this network of protected areas is derived from the capacity for turnover in the important species at each site as species' distributions and abundances alter in response to climate.

Here we develop analytical methods for exploring the strengths of interactions within bipartite networks consisting of two guilds of phylogenetically related species. We then apply these methods to investigate the resilience of a plant-pollinator community to anticipated climate change. The methods allow the statistical assessment of, for example, whether closely related pollinators are more likely to visit plants with similar relative frequencies, and whether closely related pollinators tend to visit closely related plants. The methods can also incorporate trait information, allowing us to identify which plant traits are likely responsible for attracting different pollinators. These questions are important for our study of 14 prairie plants and their 22 insect pollinators. Over the last 70 years, six of the plants have advanced their flowering, while eight have not. When we experimentally forced earlier flowering times, five of the six advanced-flowering species experienced higher pollinator visitation rates, whereas only one of the eight other species had more visits; this network thus appears resilient to climate change, because those species with advanced flowering have ample pollinators earlier in the season. Using the methods developed here, we show that advanced-flowering plants did not have a distinct pollinator community from the other eight species. Furthermore, pollinator phylogeny did not explain pollinator community composition; closely related pollinators were not more likely to visit the same plant species. However, differences among pollinator communities visiting different plants were explained by plant height, floral color, and symmetry. As a result, closely related plants attracted similar numbers of pollinators. By parsing out characteristics that explain why plants share pollinators, we can identify plant species that likely share a common fate in a changing climate.",,,,"Rafferty, Nicole/F-1812-2013","Rafferty, Nicole/0000-0002-6350-1705",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,OCT,2013,94,10,,,,,2321,2333,,10.1890/12-1948.1,,,,,,,WOS:000325692900023,24358717,,,,,

Temporal variation in the direct and indirect influence that hosts and parasites exert on each other is still poorly understood. However, variation in species' influence due to species and interactions turnover can have important consequences for host community dynamics and/or for parasite transmission dynamics, and eventually for the risk of zoonotic diseases. 2. We used data on a network of small mammals and their ectoparasites surveyed over 6 years to test hypotheses exploring (i) the temporal variability in direct and indirect influences species exert on each other in a community, and (ii) the differences in temporal variability of direct/indirect influences between temporally persistent (TP) and temporally intermittent species. 3. We modelled the temporal variation in (i) direct reciprocal influence between hosts and parasites (hosts providing resources to parasites and parasites exploiting the resources of hosts), using an asymmetry index, and (ii) indirect influence among species within a community (e. g. facilitation of parasite infestation by other parasites), using betweenness centrality. We also correlated asymmetry and centrality to examine the relationship between them. 4. Network dynamics was determined by TP species but even those species had strong among-species heterogeneity in the temporal variation of the direct/indirect effects they exerted. In addition, there was a significant positive linear correlation between asymmetry and centrality. 5. We conclude that the temporal dynamics of host-parasite interactions is driven by TP hosts. However, even within this group of persistent species, some exhibit large temporal variation, such that the functional roles they play (e. g. in promoting parasite transmission) change over time. In addition, parasites having a large negative impact on hosts are also those facilitating the spread of other parasites through the entire host community.

We find that large felids had diets that were more constrained than those of co-occurring predators, and largely influenced by an increase in Rangifer abundance after the LGM. Moreover, the structural organization of Beringian and European communities strongly differed: compared with Europe, species interactions in Beringian communities before-and possibly after-the LGM were highly modular.

Similar to many other regions around the world, effective mitigation of these threats through ecosystem-based marine spatial planning is currently constrained by a lack of knowledge of the extent and direction of dispersal of eggs, larvae, recruits, juveniles or adults among the coral reefs (termed population connectivity). Here, we present the outcomes of a series of consultations between Marine Protected Area planners, managers and scientists aimed at facilitating the integration of this connectivity knowledge into effective management guidelines and policy in north-west Australia. Through this process, we first synthesised current knowledge of population connectivity in the fields of oceanography, larval biology and population genetics, and then identified and answered to the best of our ability the most useful questions for the spatial planning of Marine Protected Area networks. Key findings indicate that these systems are likely ecologically independent for many coral reef organisms, with hard corals exhibiting the most localised dispersal of species studied so far. Thus, given that hard corals are also the habitat forming species, and that more widely dispersing species such as fish are likely less vulnerable to small scale disturbance, we propose that no-take areas that facilitate resilience of hard coral populations should maximise biodiversity more generally. This means no-take areas that are large enough to encompass routine dispersal distances of corals (10-20 km), and are spaced at similar distances, will not only maintain self-replenishment, but also aid recovery after disturbance through connectivity between no-take areas. The results can be applied in a regional and wider context, and provide a valuable template for transfer of scientific knowledge into effective policy. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Twenty per cent of all species (60 plants and 220 pollinators) in the pooled network were aliens, being involved in 38 per cent of the interactions. Most aliens were insects, especially dipterans (36%), hymenopterans (30%) and lepidopterans (14%). These alien insects had more links than either endemic pollinators or non-endemic natives, some even acting as island hubs. Aliens linked mostly to generalized species, increasing nestedness and thus network stability. Moreover, they infiltrated all seven connected modules (determined by geographical and phylogenetic constraints) of the overall network, representing around 30 per cent of species in two of them.

In the absence of reliable data, land managers are left with little more than observations and perceptions to support management decisions of road-associated disturbances. Roads can negatively impact the soil, hydrologic, plant, and animal processes on which virtually all ecosystem services depend. The Interpreting Indicators of Rangeland Health (IIRH) protocol is a qualitative method that has been demonstrated to be effective in characterizing impacts of roads. The goal of this study were to develop, describe, and test an approach for using IIRH to systematically evaluate road impacts across large, diverse arid and semiarid landscapes. We developed a stratified random sampling approach to plot selection based on ecological potential, road inventory data, and image interpretation of road impacts. The test application on a semiarid landscape in southern New Mexico, United States, demonstrates that the approach developed is sensitive to road impacts across a broad range of ecological sites but that not all the types of stratification were useful. Ecological site and road inventory strata accounted for significant variability in the functioning of ecological processes but stratification based on apparent impact did not. Analysis of the repeatability of IIRH applied to road plots indicates that the method is repeatable but consensus evaluations based on multiple observers should be used to minimize risk of bias. Landscape-scale analysis of impacts by roads of contrasting designs (maintained dirt or gravel roads vs. non- or infrequently maintained roads) suggests that future travel management plans for the study area should consider concentrating traffic on fewer roads that are well designed and maintained. Application of the approach by land managers will likely provide important insights into minimizing impacts of road networks on key ecosystem services.",,,,,"Duniway, Michael/0000-0002-9643-2785",,,,,,,,,,,,1550-7424,,,,,MAY,2013,66,3,,,,,364,375,,10.2111/REM-D-11-00130.1,,,,,,,WOS:000319486300013,,,,,,

Native Colorado River cutthroat trout (CRCT; Oncorhynchus clarkii pleuriticus) are now relegated to 309 isolated high-elevation (>1700m) headwater stream fragments in the Upper Colorado River Basin, owing to past nonnative trout invasions and habitat loss. Predicted changes in climate (i.e., temperature and precipitation) and resulting changes in stochastic physical disturbances (i.e., wildfire, debris flow, and channel drying and freezing) could further threaten the remaining CRCT populations. We developed an empirical model to predict stream temperatures at the fragment scale from downscaled climate projections along with geomorphic and landscape variables. We coupled these spatially explicit predictions of stream temperature with a Bayesian Network (BN) model that integrates stochastic risks from fragmentation to project persistence of CRCT populations across the upper Colorado River basin to 2040 and 2080. Overall, none of the populations are at risk from acute mortality resulting from high temperatures during the warmest summer period. In contrast, only 37% of populations have a 90% chance of persistence for 70years (similar to the typical benchmark for conservation), primarily owing to fragmentation. Populations in short stream fragments <7km long, and those at the lowest elevations, are at the highest risk of extirpation. Therefore, interactions of stochastic disturbances with fragmentation are projected to be greater threats than warming for CRCT populations. The reason for this paradox is that past nonnative trout invasions and habitat loss have restricted most CRCT populations to high-elevation stream fragments that are buffered from the potential consequences of warming, but at risk of extirpation from stochastic events. The greatest conservation need is for management to increase fragment lengths to forestall these risks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,1365-2486,,,,MAY,2013,19,5,,,,,1383,1398,,10.1111/gcb.12136,,,,,,,WOS:000317284700005,23505098,,,,,

Several methodological and scientific challenges are faced in constructing such networks. First, ecological networks need to incorporate habitat connectivity for species with different ecological requirements. Secondly, the networks should be based on functional connectivity rather than on structural connectivity alone. Thirdly, connectivity needs to be treated as a continuous variable. We propose a non-oriented approach of landscape description to identify favourable areas and measure functional connectivity for multi-specific applications, using three groups of common bird species (farmland specialists, forest specialists and generalists) as indicators of biodiversity. In the highly anthropized region of Seine-et-Marne, we defined 20 landscape types based on composition and configuration. We used statistical modelling to obtain a value of favourability for each landscape type for each bird group. We then mapped landscape favourability, for the three groups in 1982 and 2003 to identify favourable entities (adjacent favourable landscape units) and determine connectivity. We then examined temporal changes in the favourable areas and their connectivity and determined the sensitivity of the favourable landscape types to land cover change. Composition and configuration both influenced landscape favourability. Some landscape types were favourable for several groups of species and could potentially serve as junction landscapes in ecological networks that accommodate a variety of ecological requirements. Increasing urbanization and fragmentation between 1982 and 2003 resulted in a decrease in favourable landscape units, as well as consequent decreases in favourable areas and connectivity, for the three species groups. Connectivity loss was greatest for farmland and generalist species, as it was already high for forest species in 1982. Such a non-oriented landscape description could be used to delineate multi-specific ecological networks at regional and national scales and could be further developed to study the connectivity of communities. The maps of favourability produced here could also be used in combination with other methods, such as graphs or circuits, to detect ecological corridors and stepping stones to habitat connectivity.",,,,,"Houet, Thomas/0000-0001-5890-6145",,,,,,,,,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,,,MAY,2013,4,5,,,,,453,463,,10.1111/2041-210x.12024,,,,,,,WOS:000319072300006,,,,,,

By building on a graph-theoretical modeling framework, we here develop a connectivity model of how varying levels of area protection and unprotected areas predetermined for destruction affect species differently depending on (1) their tradeoff in colonization versus habitat utilization ability and (2) their maximum dispersal ability. We apply our model to 20,000 patches of old pine forest in northern Sweden, which host many threatened species but are scattered in a landscape dominated by intensive forestry. Unprotected mature forests stands predestined for logging are treated as adequate but temporarily available habitat for colonization specialists, whereas the same stands are assumed to, at best, serve only as intermediate stepping-stones for habitat specialists as they disperse between long-standing forests in protected areas. Our results show that the effect of habitat fragmentation on metapopulation persistence differs greatly not only depending on the dispersal distance of a particular species, but also on how well it utilizes habitat patches of different longevity. Such traits are discussed with respect to the spatiotemporal planning of habitat protection. Also, we suggest that the negative impacts of logging on biodiversity may be reduced if forestry practice is adjusted to better account for the ecological values of maturing production stands, through spatially explicit modeling of connectivity and of complementarity in the protection gradient.

Comparable studies have largely not accounted for uncertainty, which may lead to inappropriate conclusions. We quantified the contribution of four sources of variation (choice of general circulation models, emission scenarios and species distribution modelling methods and variation in species distribution data) to uncertainty in forecasts and tested if our projections were robust to these uncertainties. Declines in the availability of suitable climate within the IBA network by 2100 were forecast as extremely likely' for 45% of species, whereas increases were projected for only 2%. Thus, we predict almost 24 times as many losers' as winners'. However, for no species was suitable climate extremely likely' to be completely lost from the network. Considerable turnover (median=43%, 95% CI=3569%) in species compositions of most IBAs were projected by 2100. Climatic conditions in 47% of IBAs were projected as extremely likely' to become suitable for fewer priority species. However, no IBA was forecast to become suitable for more species. Variation among General Circulation Models and Species Distribution Models contributed most to uncertainty among forecasts. This uncertainty precluded firm conclusions for 53% of species and IBAs because 95% confidence intervals included projections of no change. Considering this uncertainty, however, allows robust recommendations concerning the remaining species and IBAs. Overall, while the IBA network will continue to sustain bird conservation, climate change will modify which species each site will be suitable for.

However, most research has been carried out in systems with discrete habitat boundaries and a clear insular structure. Stream networks deviate from the insular structure and can serve as excellent model systems for studying hierarchical community dynamics over different temporal and spatial extents. We used benthic invertebrate data from streams in a small northern Swedish catchment to test whether metacommunity dynamics change between seasons, across spatial hierarchies (i.e. at the whole catchment scale vs. the scales of first-order and second/third-order sites within the catchment) and between stream-order groups. We assessed metacommunity structure as a function of three relevant dispersal dimensions (directional downstream processes, along-stream dispersal and overland dispersal). These dispersal dimensions were related to species groups with relevant dispersal traits (flying capacity, drift propensity) and dispersal capacities (weak vs. strong) to elucidate whether the observed spatial signals were due to dispersal limitation or mass effects. Results showed complex community organization that varied between seasons, with the scale of observation, and with stream order. The importance of spatial factors and specific dispersal dimensions was highly dependent on the time of sampling and the scale of observation. The importance of environmental factors was more consistent in our analyses, but their effect on species community structure peaked at first-order sites. Our analyses of species dispersal traits were not unequivocal, but indicated that both mass effects and dispersal limitation could simultaneously contribute to the spatial signal at the scale of the whole catchment through different dispersal pathways. We conclude that the study of hierarchically organized ecosystems uncovers complex patterns of metacommunity organization that may deviate substantially from those of systems with insular structure and discrete habitat boundaries. Moreover, we show that dispersal constraints imposed by the dendritic structure of stream networks and distinct dispersal mechanisms (e.g. dispersal limitation) may be evident also at very small spatial extents. Thus, even at this small scale, a landscape management approach that takes the dendritic nature of stream networks into account is needed to effectively conserve stream biodiversity.",,,,"Gothe, Emma/A-6310-2016; Sandin, Leonard/K-4475-2012","Gothe, Emma/0000-0002-7387-6770; Sandin, Leonard/0000-0003-1685-5305",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,,,,,MAR,2013,82,2,,,,,449,458,,10.1111/1365-2656.12004,,,,,,,WOS:000315122100017,23163593,,,,,

Livestock density is reduced in plantation areas. Species composition beneath tree plantations was significantly different from both pasture and nearby permanent protection areas. Permanent protection areas near plantations were also compositionally different from pastures. Eucalypt plantation was the environment type where ruderals were most abundant. Growth form cover distribution in pasture areas showed a consistent pattern, with graminous herbs being the most common growth form followed by prostrate herbs, prostrate subshrubs, and standing subshrubs. In plantation areas, the dominance of the graminoid herb growth form increased markedly, as well as standing herbs.

Ceara, in the Brazilian Northeast, has a considerable potential for the generation of environment-friendly power, due to the occurrence of strong winds on many parts of the coast and at higher elevations. Given this, the present study aimed to evaluate the socio-environmental damage caused by the installation of a wind farm on the coastal plain of the municipality of Camocim, on the western coast of the state, and to identify the consequences for the coastal environment and the traditional community of Xavier, which survives primarily on fishing, agriculture, and the extraction of natural resources. The study was based on the recognition and definition of the environmental components of the local landscapes, and the mapping of the community's territory, based on the social cartography approach. The study area is characterized by mangrove ecosystems, dune fields, interdunal lakes, fluvial-lacustrine coastal plains, and a sandy beach. The integration of these different environments underpins the traditional lifestyle of the local community, which is based primarily on the exploitation of natural resources. Given this, the community of Xavier, which is made up of 20 families, was affected directly by the installation and subsequent operation of the local wind farm (one of the largest in the Brazilian Northeast, with 50 wind turbines generating a maximum output of 104.4 MW, and approximately 135 km of transmission lines) through (1) the gratuitous occupation of a significant portion of the community's territory, (2) deforestation of fixed dunes, (3) the suppression of dunes by bulldozing, (4) burying of interdunal lakes, (5) disturbance of the margins of fluvial-lacustrine systems, (6) compaction and impermeabilization of the soil, and (7) artificial retention of mobile dunes. These findings indicate that the licensing of wind farms in the state ignores a set of socio-environmental principles. The results of this analysis indicate the need for a regional blueprint for the development of effective socio-environmental policies for the sustainable exploitation of the coastline of the Brazilian Northeast, and in particular for the definition of the sectors most appropriate for the installation of wind farms, such as the coastal plains, which have been classified as the alternative sites with the best potential, as long as effective licensing measures are implemented.",,,,,"Gorayeb, Adryane/0000-0002-7304-8836",,,,,,,,,,,,0749-0208,1551-5036,,,,,2013,,,1,,65,,81,86,,10.2112/SI65-015.1,,,,,,,WOS:000337995500016,,,,,,

Ken; Nichols, James D.",,,Resilience Thinking and a Decision-Analytic Approach to Conservation: Strange Bedfellows or Essential Partners?,ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY,,,,,,,,,,,,"There has been some tendency to view decision science and resilience theory as opposing approaches, or at least as contending perspectives, for natural resource management. Resilience proponents have been especially critical of optimization in decision science, at least for those cases where it is focused on the aggressive pursuit of efficiency. In general, optimization of resource systems is held to reduce spatial, temporal, or organizational heterogeneity that would otherwise limit efficiency, leading to homogenization of a system and making it less able to cope with unexpected changes or disturbances. For their part, decision analysts have been critical of resilience proponents for not providing much practical advice to decision makers. We believe a key source of tension between resilience thinking and application of decision science is the pursuit of efficiency in the latter (i.e., choosing the best management action or strategy option to maximize productivity of one or few resource components), vs. a desire in the former to keep options open (i.e., maintaining and enhancing diversity). It seems obvious, however, that with managed natural systems, there must be a principle by which to guide decision making, which at a minimum allows for a comparison of projected outcomes associated with decision alternatives. This is true even if the primary concern of decision making is the preservation of system resilience. We describe how a careful framing of conservation problems, especially in terms of management objectives and predictive models, can help reduce the purported tension between resilience thinking and decision analysis. In particular, objective setting in conservation problems needs to be more attuned to the dynamics of ecological systems and to the possibility of deep uncertainties that underlie the risk of unintended, if not irreversible, outcomes. Resilience thinking also leads to the suggestion that model development should focus more on process rather than pattern, on multiple scales of influence, and on phenomena that can create alternative stability regimes. Although we acknowledge the inherent difficulties in modeling ecological processes, we stress that formulation of useful models need not depend on a thorough mechanistic understanding or precise parameterization, assuming that uncertainty is acknowledged and treated in a systematic manner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1708-3087,,,,,,2013,18,2,,,,,,,27,10.5751/ES-05544-180227,,,,,,,WOS:000321257100037,,,,,,

The integration of biogeography and network theory will yield important results and further our understanding of species interactions.

Here, we propose a general framework to study the dissimilarity of species interaction networks over time, space or environments, allowing both the use of quantitative and qualitative data. We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of beta-diversity.

There are a number of theories and processes relating to invasive alien species (IAS) and their interactions with natural enemies (predators, parasites and pathogens), including the enemy release hypothesis, spillover and spillback. 2. Most empirical studies focus on pairwise interactions and are limited to the population-level avoiding the complexities of a community approach. Oversimplified studies could result in misleading conclusions because of the importance of positive and negative feedback mechanisms, mediated by parasites, throughout communities and beyond. 3. Recent advances in ecological networks analysis (ENA) provide a powerful framework to investigate the complexity of interactions within ecological communities and response to disturbance, such as the arrival of an IAS. Molecular data, from either standard PCR or next-generation approaches, can be incorporated into ecological networks to enable the number and strength of interactions to be quantified; however, this has rarely been performed so far. 4. In this paper, we explore the contribution of parasite interactions, in the context of community ecology, to the success of invasive alien predatory insects with specific reference to the harlequin ladybird, Harmonia axyridis. We begin by defining the main theories and processes relating to parasitehost interactions in the context of invasion biology, before exploring the advantages of a community ecology approach, and particularly ENA, for revealing dominant mechanisms in determining the success of invasion.",,,,"Roy, Helen/A-1488-2010","Lawson Handley, Lori/0000-0002-8153-5511",,,,,,,,,,,,0269-8463,1365-2435,,,,DEC,2012,26,6,,,,,1238,1248,,10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.02032.x,,,,,,,WOS:000311433600003,,,,,,

Plant cover was sampled using linear sampling in several vegetation types: deciduous forest, a dry forest, sand dune pioneers, sand dune scrub, ecotone of freshwater marsh, deciduous forest and dune scrub, and mangrove forest. We sampled ant-plant interactions and vegetation cover before and after Hurricane Karl hitting (September 2010) the central coast of the state of Veracruz, Mexico. The pre-hurricane network consisted of 16 plant and 25 ant species in 52 associations. The post-hurricane network consisted of 17 plant and 20 ant species in 56 associations. We found a significant decrease in the total linear cover of EFN-bearing plants between October 2009 (646 m, no hurricane effect) and October 2010 (393 m, after hurricane Karl) (total sample length 2025 m). Both networks were significantly nested (0.999 and 0.973, P < 0.001), suggesting that network topology remained similar. Our results show changes in several network characteristics and species proportions. The number of plant species that contributed to nestedness vs. idiosyncratic species did not differ significantly in the pre-hurricane network, while the number of plant species that contributed to nestedness vs. idiosyncratic species did differ significantly in the post-hurricane network. The number of ant species that contributed to nestedness vs. idiosyncratic species differed significantly in the pre-hurricane network, and also in the post-hurricane network. Differences in nestedness contributions of species before and after the hurricane reflect an alteration from a generalized, highly nested, more stable pre-disturbance network, to a more low-degree or specialized network (i.e. fewer interactions among generalist species, those species with the most associations).

A long-standing question in ecology is how natural populations respond to a changing environment. Emergent optimal foraging theory-based models for individual variation go beyond the population level and predict how its individuals would respond to disturbances that produce changes in resource availability. 2. Evaluating variations in resource use patterns at the intrapopulation level in wild populations under changing environmental conditions would allow to further advance in the research on foraging ecology and evolution by gaining a better idea of the underlying mechanisms explaining trophic diversity. 3. In this study, we use a large spatio-temporal scale data set (western continental Europe, 19682006) on the diet of Bonellis Eagle Aquila fasciata breeding pairs to analyse the predator trophic responses at the intrapopulation level to a prey population crash. In particular, we borrow metrics from studies on network structure and intrapopulation variation to understand how an emerging infectious disease [the rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD)] that caused the density of the eagles primary prey (rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus) to dramatically drop across Europe impacted on resource use patterns of this endangered raptor. 4. Following the major RHD outbreak, substantial changes in Bonellis Eagles diet diversity and organisation patterns at the intrapopulation level took place. Dietary variation among breeding pairs was larger after than before the outbreak. Before RHD, there were no clusters of pairs with similar diets, but significant clustering emerged after RHD. Moreover, diets at the pair level presented a nested pattern before RHD, but not after. 5. Here, we reveal how intrapopulation patterns of resource use can quantitatively and qualitatively vary, given drastic changes in resource availability. 6.

We focused on the Mediterranean shrubland, comparing different biogeographical scenarios (insular and continental) that share the same basic species composition. Location The study was conducted within one mainland (southern Spain) and four island localities: two in the Canary Islands (oceanic origin) and two in the Balearic Islands (continental origin). Methods We built qualitative (presence/absence of interaction) and quantitative seed dispersal networks (number of consumed fruits) and used different descriptor parameters, such as connectance, nestedness, interaction asymmetry and various interaction diversity indices that describe their topology. To assemble the interaction networks, we used data on the presence of different species of fruits in systematically collected droppings of the different seed dispersers; seeds in droppings were identified by means of a binocular lens whereas a microscope was used to identify pericarp tissue remains. Results Island networks were smaller and less complex (a lower number of observed links than expected for their size) than the mainland network. As expected, connectance was higher within islands than on the mainland. By contrast, nestedness was consistently high at all sites, although relative nestedness (which accounts for network size) was lower within islands, whether continental or oceanic. At both community and species level (especially for animals) interactions tended to be more specialized and symmetric within the islands. Main conclusions The lower species number and greater specialization in insular seed dispersal systems appears to lead to the prevalence of more symmetric interactions than those found on the mainland. This indicates that insular mutualistic interactions and interacting species are more vulnerable than mainland ones to disturbances, as previous work has suggested that asymmetrical interactions facilitate the maintenance of biodiversity and act as a resilience mechanism against species extinction.",,,,"Gonzalez-Castro, Aaron/K-3290-2016; Traveset, Anna V/D-7802-2011; Nogales, Manuel/I-9831-2014","Gonzalez-Castro, Aaron/0000-0002-5311-1017; Nogales, Manuel/0000-0002-5327-3104",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,NOV,2012,39,11,,,,,1938,1947,,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2012.02693.x,,,,,,,WOS:000310266600003,,,,,,

W.; Brehme, Cheryl S.; Hines, James E.; Nichols, James D.; Fisher, Robert N.",,,Joint estimation of habitat dynamics and species interactions: disturbance reduces co-occurrence of non-native predators with an endangered toad,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Ecologists have long been interested in the processes that determine patterns of species occurrence and co-occurrence. Potential short-comings of many existing empirical approaches that address these questions include a reliance on patterns of occurrence at a single time point, failure to account properly for imperfect detection and treating the environment as a static variable. 2. We fit detection and non-detection data collected from repeat visits using a dynamic site occupancy model that simultaneously accounts for the temporal dynamics of a focal prey species, its predators and its habitat. Our objective was to determine how disturbance and species interactions affect the co-occurrence probabilities of an endangered toad and recently introduced non-native predators in stream breeding habitats. For this, we determined statistical support for alternative processes that could affect co-occurrence frequency in the system. 3. We collected occurrence data at stream segments in two watersheds where streams were largely ephemeral and one watershed dominated by perennial streams. Co-occurrence probabilities of toads with non-native predators were related to disturbance frequency, with low co-occurrence in the ephemeral watershed and high co-occurrence in the perennial watershed. This occurred because once predators were established at a site, they were rarely lost from the site except in cases when the site dried out. Once dry sites became suitable again, toads colonized them much more rapidly than predators, creating a period of predator-free space. 4. We attribute the dynamics to a storage effect, where toads persisting outside the stream environment during periods of drought rapidly colonized sites when they become suitable again. Our results support that even in highly connected stream networks, temporal disturbance can structure frequencies with which breeding amphibians encounter non-native predators. 5. Dynamic multi-state occupancy models are a powerful tool for rigorously examining hypotheses about inter-species and specieshabitat interactions. In contrast to previous methods that infer dynamic processes based on static patterns in occupancy, the approach we took allows the dynamic processes that determine speciesspecies and specieshabitat interactions to be directly estimated.",,,,"Nichols, James/AAF-7336-2020; Miller, David/E-4492-2012","Miller, David/0000-0002-3011-3677; Brehme, Cheryl/0000-0001-8904-3354",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,,,,,NOV,2012,81,6,,,,,1288,1297,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.02001.x,,,,,,,WOS:000310554300015,22702337,,,,,

Despite the accumulating evidence base for global declines in bee populations, few studies have addressed the relative importance of local environmental and large-scale spatial factors in maintaining diverse bee communities outside of agricultural habitats, and particularly in areas protected for nature conservation. We analysed bee community data that we collected from 40 Special Areas of Conservation representing five distinct European Natura 2000 priority habitats in Ireland, quantifying local habitat features within each site and surrounding land-use. Species data were collected in a nested sampling design composed of three hierarchical levels such as site, habitat and region and analysed using diversity partitioning. The speciesenvironment relationship was also decomposed into regional-, landscape- and local-scales by variance partitioning using partial canonical correspondence analysis. Wild bee species richness and abundance were highly dependent on habitat type, but the majority of regional diversity was contained within sites, as opposed to species turnover across sites and regions. Bee communities were primarily structured by local-scale factors associated with nesting resources and grazing regime, with non-Bombus taxa being more sensitive to landscape-scale differences in adjacent habitats than Bombus taxa. Regional-scale processes, such as species sorting along longitudinal gradients, were of minor importance in structuring bee communities in this system. Synthesis and applications. Within habitats, local species richness, rather than species turnover at higher spatial scales, accounted for the majority of regional bee diversity. Local environmental factors were powerful determinants of community composition. Therefore, management effort prioritising the maintenance of a diversity of high-quality habitats within a broad network of protected areas best facilitates bee conservation in this system. At a regional level, schemes for conserving and restoring important bee habitats must be habitat- and taxon-specific, as the impact of individual local-scale factors and surrounding land-use on community composition is highly habitat- and taxon-dependent.",,,,"Byrne, Andrew/N-3894-2015; Fealy, Reamonn M/D-4880-2013; Paxton, Robert/D-7082-2015; Murray, Tomas E/C-5540-2013","Byrne, Andrew/0000-0003-0296-4586; Fealy, Reamonn M/0000-0003-4534-1530; Paxton, Robert/0000-0003-2517-1351; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,,,,,OCT,2012,49,5,,,,,998,1008,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02175.x,,,,,,,WOS:000308932600004,,,,,,

However, very little is known about the effects of anthropogenic forest edges and of local disturbance on the structure and robustness of plantfrugivore networks. We carried out focal tree observations to record the frugivore species feeding on eight canopy tree species in the forest interior and at forestfarmland edges in a little and a highly disturbed part of a Kenyan rain forest. For each frugivore species, we recorded its body mass and its forest dependence. We examined how forest edge and local disturbance affected the abundance, the richness and the composition of the frugivore community and tested whether forest edge and local disturbance affected plant frugivore networks. Abundance and species richness of frugivores were higher at edges than in the forest interior. Forest visitors and small-bodied frugivores increased, while forest specialists decreased in abundance at forest edges. The changes in frugivore community composition resulted in plantfrugivore networks that were more connected, more nested and more robust against species extinctions at forestfarmland edges than in the forest interior. Network specialization was lower at forest edges than in the forest interior because at the edges plant specialization on frugivores was very low in small-fruited species. In contrast, small-fruited plants were more specialized than large-fruited plants in the forest interior. Our findings suggest that forest-visiting birds may stabilize seed-dispersal services for small-fruited plant species at rain forest margins, while seed-dispersal services for large-fruited plant species may be disrupted at forest edges due to the decrease of large-bodied frugviores.

Selection of marine protected networks (MPA) will depend on both the connectivity of concerned species and the habitat quality of individual sites. We explore the relative effect of connectivity and habitat quality on solutions for optimal networks of MPA using eigenvalue perturbation theory and a metapopulation model. Based on analyses of both synthetic networks and realistic connectivities for a sessile invertebrate with planktonic larvae in the Baltic Sea, we show that connectivity is expected to be more efficient than habitat quality as a selection criterion for MPA networks with realistic probabilities of local recruitment. In a second series of analyses we explore the effect of temporal variability of connectivity on the selection of optimal MPA networks. We show that optimal solutions of MPA networks converged when based on 8-10 years of connectivity information, corresponding to the time scale of the North-Atlantic oscillation. In conclusion, this study indicates that connectivity may be more important than habitat quality as selection criterion for MPAs when targeting species with long-distance dispersal that is typical for many marine invertebrates and fish. Our study also shows that connectivity patterns may be relatively consistent in time which suggests that the recent progress in biophysical modelling can offer a framework for optimal selection of MPA networks based on connectivities, which should improve guidelines for the design of functional MPA networks.

In this study, we model the temporal evolution of three empirical plantpollination networks incorporating both population and topological dynamics. We test the hypothesis that topological plasticity, realized through the ability of animals to rewire their connections after depletion of host abundances, enhances tolerance of mutualistic networks to species loss. We also compared the performance of various rewiring rules in affecting robustness. 3. The results show that topological plasticity markedly increased the robustness of mutualistic networks. Our analyses also revealed that network robustness reached maximum levels when animals with less host plant availability were more likely to rewire. Also, preferential attachment to richer host plants, that is, to plants exhibiting higher abundance and few exploiters, enhances robustness more than other rewiring alternatives. 4.

Organic enrichment affects the abundance and diversity of meio- and macro-fauna, but its impact on food web dynamics is less well known. We used a manipulative field experiment combining stable isotope enrichment with compartmental modelling (WinSAAM) and ecological network analysis (EcoNet) to investigate the impacts of organic enrichment on the food web structure and dynamics of an estuarine sandflat, and to evaluate the combined use of structural and process indicators in estuaries. Organic enrichment was achieved by addition of powdered algae to increase organic content (OC) from 0.8% (background) to 3,5 and 10%. Six dominant compartments including microphytobenthos, meiofauna and soldier crabs (Mictyris longicarpus) were sampled. Increasing organic content decreased the total abundance of meiofauna and number of meiofaunal taxa. C flow rates and indices reflecting system functioning, however, showed non-linear responses. Carbon flow rates between compartments and the proportion of carbon cycling within the system both decreased from background to enrichment at 3 and 5% OC, but then increased at 10% OC. On these measures the highest OC treatment was most similar to background controls, which could be misinterpreted as a sign of health of highly enriched sites. Additional interpretation of indicators for the 10% treatment showed, however, that the high proportion of internal cycling was a result of a much reduced number of compartments (i.e. some taxa had been lost). The combination of trophodynamic process indices and structural population measures together provided the more comprehensive and robust assessment of the effects of organic loading on estuaries.

The species and ecosystems in these human-dominated landscapes are highly endangered. Understanding the effects of human activities on wildlife is therefore important for devising an appropriate conservation strategy in this region. Here, we show, using data on spatial structure of three endangered mountain ungulates, that presence of these species is determined by the level of human disturbance and habitat requirements. We show that species preferring flat areas covered by dense forest are exposed to more intensive human disturbances, and even an adaptation to rugged areas does not imply less human disturbance. Abundance of all species studied declined with the number of villages in the vicinity and increased with distance to nearest village. Therefore, increasing human population may contribute to a decrease of wildlife population in the region.

P.; Brooks, Edward J.; Croft, Darren P.; Sims, David W.",,,Developing a deeper understanding of animal movements and spatial dynamics through novel application of network analyses,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. Determining how animals move within their environment is a fundamental knowledge that contributes to effective management and conservation. Continuous round-the-clock animal movement data are frequently gathered using biotelemetry technology, providing discrete data packages on the presence similar to absence of animals at known locations through time. Current analyses of such data do not generally account for the interconnectivity of locations as animals move between them and consequently do not integrate graphically or statistically a temporal component to spatial changes. 2. Here, we describe the novel application of network analyses to electronic tag data whereby nodes represent locations and edges the movements of individuals. We demonstrate some of the descriptive and quantitative approaches for determining how an animals movement interconnects home range habitats. Telemetry data from arrays of recorders provide movement data of individual animals, and as examples of the method proposed, we examine the movements of two distinct shark species, the small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and the Caribbean reef shark (Carcharhinus perezi). In doing so, we consider both local and global network properties from an animal movement perspective and simulate the effects of node disruption as a proxy for habitat disturbance. 3. Comparative visual representations of two catshark movement networks suggest, for example, potential differences in space use. Multiple regression quadratic assignment procedure shows that habitat is a significant predictor of movement behaviour. 4. Null modelling of C.similar to perezi movement data, corrected for the spatial restriction of static nodes, demonstrated a significant, non-random distribution of directed movements among sites. Additionally, the connectivity of this animals movement network is significantly reduced through targeted disruption of a site of high centrality but not through disruption of a randomly selected site. 5. Network theory is a well-established theoretical framework and its integration into the fast developing field of animal movement and telemetry might improve significantly how we interpret animal space use from electronically recorded data. This technique has potentially wide application in animal behaviour but may also inform the management of habitat harbouring threatened or endangered species via the simulation, modelling and intuitive visualisation of animal movement interactions.",,,,"Brooks, Edward/G-4697-2011; Croft, Darren P/B-5503-2009","Brooks, Edward/0000-0001-5206-7133; Croft, Darren P/0000-0001-6869-5097; Jacoby, David/0000-0003-2729-3811",,,,,,,,,,,,2041-210X,2041-2096,,,,JUN,2012,3,3,,,,,574,583,,10.1111/j.2041-210X.2012.00187.x,,,,,,,WOS:000304902500016,,,,,,

Comparing network and instream habitat variables to explain densities of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in mid-coastal Oregon, USA",AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aquatic ecologists are working to develop theory and techniques for analysis of dynamic stream processes and communities of organisms. Such work is critical for the development of conservation plans that are relevant at the scale of entire ecosystems. The stream network is the foundation upon which stream systems are organized. Natural and human disturbances in streams alter the configuration of stream habitats such as pools, riffles, and glides across seasons, decades, or centuries. Thus, native aquatic species have developed mechanisms for adapting to the dynamic configuration of habitats in stream networks. At different spatial scales, stream network structure informs habitat connectivity for aquaticobligate species. The movement of aquatic species both upstream and downstream is limited by stream channels and may be modified by the downstream flow of water, nutrients, and physical materials such as wood and substrate. Analysing streams as networks offers a realistic and holistic perspective for assessing movement and distribution by freshwater aquatic species in response to life-history needs and environmental conditions. In this study, network analysis was facilitated by automating, in a Geographic Information System, the calculation of network distances and variables that represent spatial configuration. A comparison between traditional instream habitat variables and network variables for juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in seven sub-basins of Oregon's mid-coast over a 5-year period revealed that network variables perform better at explaining juvenile coho salmon density than instream habitat variables. Moreover, analysis of network distances among seasonal habitats indicates that juvenile coho salmon density may be higher where the distance between critical seasonal habitats is short. This work furthers aquatic conservation, management, and restoration by including analysis of the proximity and connectivity among aquatic freshwater habitats. Published in 2012.

J,"Rzanny, M; Voigt, W",,,,"Rzanny, Michael; Voigt, Winfried",,,Complexity of multitrophic interactions in a grassland ecosystem depends on plant species diversity,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. We studied the theoretical prediction that a loss of plant species richness has a strong impact on community interactions among all trophic levels and tested whether decreased plant species diversity results in a less complex structure and reduced interactions in ecological networks. 2. Using plant species-specific biomass and arthropod abundance data from experimental grassland plots (Jena Experiment), we constructed multitrophic functional group interaction webs to compare communities based on 4 and 16 plant species. 427 insect and spider species were classified into 13 functional groups. These functional groups represent the nodes of ecological networks. Direct and indirect interactions among them were assessed using partial Mantel tests. Interaction web complexity was quantified using three measures of network structure: connectance, interaction diversity and interaction strength. 3. Compared with high plant diversity plots, interaction webs based on low plant diversity plots showed reduced complexity in terms of total connectance, interaction diversity and mean interaction strength. Plant diversity effects obviously cascade up the food web and modify interactions across all trophic levels. The strongest effects occurred in interactions between adjacent trophic levels (i.e. predominantly trophic interactions), while significant interactions among plant and carnivore functional groups, as well as horizontal interactions (i.e. interactions between functional groups of the same trophic level), showed rather inconsistent responses and were generally rarer. 4. Reduced interaction diversity has the potential to decrease and destabilize ecosystem processes. Therefore, we conclude that the loss of basal producer species leads to more simple structured, less and more loosely connected species assemblages, which in turn are very likely to decrease ecosystem functioning, community robustness and tolerance to disturbance. Our results suggest that the functioning of the entire ecological community is critically linked to the diversity of its component plants species.",,,,,"Rzanny, Michael/0000-0002-7232-5547",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,MAY,2012,81,3,,,,,614,627,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2012.01951.x,,,,,,,WOS:000302613300012,22292705,,,,,

The findings were set within a study of long term changes in soil properties in a 180 year chronosequence of oak plots from the same forest. Carbon stock increased significantly in the top mineral horizon overall increase was 5 t C ha(-1), at a mean accumulation rate of 0.34 t C ha(-1) y(-1), which was mainly due to increase in horizon thickness. No increase was seen when soils were sampled by depth. Differences obtained by depth or horizon sampling due to changes in horizon thickness over time highlight the importance of horizon in the correct evaluation of soil property change in small scale sampling programs. This is particularly important in forest soils with high litter accumulation and low turnover rates when compared to other land uses. Nitrogen stock increases below 10 cm soil depth were attributed to insect activity, litterfall variation and a change in water table. Findings were confirmed in the chronosequence study of oak across the forests; increases in soil C stocks of 0.1-0.2 t C ha(-1) y(-1) were calculated across young (similar to 25 years), mid-rotation (similar to 60 years) and old (120+ years) stands. Soil nitrogen increased significantly with canopy age whilst pH increased significantly between young-mid rotation stands but decreased between mid rotation and old stands. Significant increases in pH were also recorded before 2004 in the ECN 70 year old oak plots reflecting overall pollution recovery. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The present study describes a novel landscape analysis approach that was used in the context of municipal open space planning and regional land use and transportation planning. The project approach focused on two principles: (1) wildlife movement is not limited to formally managed reserves and corridors, but occurs across a gradient of land uses in the human landscape, and (2) that local and regional planners should be included in the process of identifying habitat connectivity needs and in turn incorporate connectivity in their own planning processes. In the first case, a species-specific combination of landscape disturbance and least-cost modeling was based on the concept that wildlife originate their movement from anywhere within suitable habitat and move in a least-costly direction. This results in a least cost surface of possible wildlife movement based on habitat preference and barriers to safe passage. In the second case, planners at two geographic scales - municipal and regional - were informed of landscape connectivity principles and their needs incorporated into the assessment itself. The least cost surface approach allows for the integration of modeled connectivity and disturbance with site-specific municipal planning activities. However, the potential for this type of local planning to be folded into local decision-making processes can be dependent on the interests of individual planners rather than being systematic in nature.

Yet seed dispersal interacts decisively with the major drivers of biodiversity change in the 21st century: habitat fragmentation, overharvesting, biological invasions, and climate change. We synthesize current knowledge of the effects these drivers have on seed dispersal to identify research gaps and to show how this information can be used to improve conservation management. The drivers, either individually, or in combination, have changed the quantity, species composition, and spatial pattern of dispersed seeds in the majority of ecosystems worldwide, with inevitable consequences for species survival in a rapidly changing world. The natural history of seed dispersal is now well-understood in a range of landscapes worldwide. Only a few generalizations that have emerged are directly applicable to conservation management, however, because they are frequently confounded by site-specific and species-specific variation. Potentially synergistic interactions between disturbances are likely to exacerbate the negative impacts, but these are rarely investigated. We recommend that the conservation status of functionally unique dispersers be revised and that the conservation target for key seed dispersers should be a population size that maintains their ecological function, rather than merely the minimum viable population. Based on our analysis of conservation needs, seed dispersal research should be carried out at larger spatial scales in heterogenous landscapes, examining the simultaneous impacts of multiple drivers on community-wide seed dispersal networks.

Even at small spatial scales, real food webs can be large and complex, describing networks of interacting species. Although significant progress has been made in recent years, understanding the mechanisms through which real systems persist in nature remains a significant challenge. Here, we describe a set of new marine benthic food webs and perturb them by suppressing the biomass of a highly connected predator, the spiny seastar, Marthasterias glacialis, The sub-systems of this food web were monitored over a twelve month period after the perturbation was applied. To identify any resulting effects, we combined topological and dynamical approaches by investigating changes in traditional univariate response variables, together with changes in bi- and trivariate food web patterns. We hypothesised that the loss of larger sized predators would have profound impacts on the entire community, however our results suggest that the suppression of M. glacialis, a highly connected predator in these systems has rather weak effects on the remaining community structure.

Nodes at each tier were linked to lower nodes if ecological and spatial relationships existed between them. All parameters had four potential discrete states: zero, low, medium, and high. Our model reliably predicted probable risk to habitats and endpoints from natural and anthropogenic disturbances. The disturbances most likely to transform habitats and effect ecological resources were forest management and wildfire. Of the six habitats, moist forest (characterized by Douglas fir and grand fir) was found to be at greatest risk of ecological impacts. The management endpoint with the highest likelihood of impact was historical range of variability (HRV) for salmon habitat, followed by recreation (hunting native ungulates) and HRV wildfire.

These emissions as radiatively active greenhouse gases in the form of both CO2 and CH4 could amplify global warming. Given the potential sensitivity of these ecosystems to climate change and the expectation that the Arctic will experience appreciable warming over the next century, it is important to assess whether responses of C exchange in tundra regions are likely to enhance or mitigate warming. In this study we compared analyses of C exchange of Arctic tundra between 1990 and 2006 among observations, regional and global applications of process-based terrestrial biosphere models, and atmospheric inversion models. Syntheses of flux observations and inversion models indicate that the annual exchange of CO2 between Arctic tundra and the atmosphere has large uncertainties that cannot be distinguished from neutral balance. The mean estimate from an ensemble of process-based model simulations suggests that Arctic tundra has acted as a sink for atmospheric CO2 in recent decades, but based on the uncertainty estimates it cannot be determined with confidence whether these ecosystems represent a weak or a strong sink. Tundra was 0.6 A degrees C warmer in the 2000s compared to the 1990s. The central estimates of the observations, process-based models, and inversion models each identify stronger sinks in the 2000s compared with the 1990s. Some of the process models indicate that this occurred because net primary production increased more in response to warming than heterotrophic respiration. Similarly, the observations and the applications of regional process-based models suggest that CH4 emissions from Arctic tundra have increased from the 1990s to 2000s because of the sensitivity of CH4 emissions to warmer temperatures. Based on our analyses of the estimates from observations, process-based models, and inversion models, we estimate that Arctic tundra was a sink for atmospheric CO2 of 110 Tg C yr(-1) (uncertainty between a sink of 291 Tg C yr(-1) and a source of 80 Tg C yr(-1)) and a source of CH4 to the atmosphere of 19 Tg C yr(-1) (uncertainty between sources of 8 and 29 Tg C yr(-1)). The suite of analyses conducted in this study indicate that it is important to reduce uncertainties in the observations, process-based models, and inversions in order to better understand the degree to which Arctic tundra is influencing atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. The reduction of uncertainties can be accomplished through (1) the strategic placement of more CO2 and CH4 monitoring stations to reduce uncertainties in inversions, (2) improved observation networks of ground-based measurements of CO2 and CH4 exchange to understand exchange in response to disturbance and across gradients of climatic and hydrological variability, and (3) the effective transfer of information from enhanced observation networks into process-based models to improve the simulation of CO2 and CH4 exchange from Arctic tundra to the atmosphere.",,,,"Oechel, Walter C/F-9361-2010; Oechel, Walter/M-1347-2019; Kimball, John S/B-9234-2011; Koven, Charles/N-8888-2014; Yi, Yonghong/C-2395-2017; Hayes, Daniel/B-8968-2012; Miller, Paul/B-4675-2013; Williams, Mathew/G-6140-2016","Oechel, Walter C/0000-0002-3504-026X; Koven, Charles/0000-0002-3367-0065; Williams, Mathew/0000-0001-6117-5208; Hayes, Daniel/0000-0002-3011-7934; Peylin, Philippe/0000-0001-9335-6994; Christensen, Torben/0000-0002-4917-148X; Miller, Paul/0000-0003-1105-2132",,,,,,,,,,,,1726-4170,1726-4189,,,,,2012,9,8,,,,,3185,3204,,10.5194/bg-9-3185-2012,,,,,,,WOS:000308290200024,,,,,,

There is an urgent need to accurately model how environmental change affects the wide-scale functioning of ecosystems, but advances are hindered by a lack of knowledge of how trophic levels are linked across space. It is unclear which theoretical approach to take to improve modelling of such interactions, but evidence is gathering that linking species responses to their functional traits can increase understanding of ecosystem dynamics. Currently, there are no quantitative studies testing how this approach might improve models of multiple, trophically interacting species, at wide spatial scales. 2. Arable weeds play a foundational role in linking food webs, providing resources for many taxa, including carabid beetles that feed on their seeds and weed-associated invertebrate prey. Here, we model associations between weeds and carabids across farmland in Great Britain (GB), to test the hypothesis that wide-scale trophic links between these groups are structured by their species functional traits. 3. A network of c. 250 arable fields, covering four crops and most lowland areas of GB, was sampled for weed, carabid and invertebrate taxa over 3 years. Data sets of these groups were closely matched in time and space, and each contained numerous species with a range of eco-physiological traits. The consistency of trophic linkages between multiple taxa sharing functional traits was tested within multivariate and log-linear models. 4. Robust links were established between the functional traits of taxa and their trophic interactions. Autumn-germinating, small-seeded weeds were associated with smaller, spring-breeding carabids, more specialised in seed feeding, whereas spring-germinating, large-seeded weeds were associated with a range of larger, autumn-breeding omnivorous carabids. These relationships were strong and dynamic, being independent of changes in invertebrate food resources and consistent across sample dates, crops and regions of GB. 5. We conclude that, in at least one system of interacting taxa, functional traits can be used to predict consistent, wide-scale trophic links. This conceptual approach is useful for assessing how perturbations affecting lower trophic levels are ramified throughout ecosystems and could be used to assess how environmental change affects a wider range of secondary consumers.",,,,"Petit, Sandrine/C-3310-2013","Petit, Sandrine/0000-0001-8781-8873; Storkey, Jonathan/0000-0003-1094-8914; Firbank, Leslie/0000-0003-1242-8293",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,JAN,2012,81,1,,,,,4,13,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01897.x,,,,,,,WOS:000297849300002,21883203,,,,,

These changes resulted in population decline of birds living in open habitats. Despite a good understanding on the effects of these driving forces on bird populations, effective conservation actions are difficult to conduct as these forces are closely connected with socioeconomic development of particular countries and thus almost impossible to reverse. It is hence necessary to conserve refuge sites with a limited influence of these negative factors. We surveyed birds in 42 abandoned military training sites (AMTS) in a central European country, the Czech Republic, and we have found these sites are valuable, and to date overlooked, refuges for bird conservation. Birds of high conservation concern and open habitats birds (such as Miliaria calandra, Saxicola torquata or Lullula arborea) were more abundant in AMTS than predicted by their total population size in the Czech Republic. The most important characteristics predicting attractiveness of AMTS for birds of conservation concern were low altitude, low proportion of forest/dense scrubland, high proportion of sparse scrubland/bare ground and large area. Former military activity was beneficial for declining open habitat birds by maintaining moderate disturbance levels, which are rarely found elsewhere in current landscapes. Owing to reduction of armed forces across Europe AMTS provide continental-wide network of high-quality sites for bird conservation.

However, when it comes to disturbed natural ecosystems, most models developed for ecological risk assessment are restricted to instant cause-effect computation of single factors and often ignore the indirect effects, therefore fail to implement a holistic assessment at an ecosystem scale when interactions of different risk receptors are obvious. In this study, we developed a risk-based network model based on a new control analysis termed control allocation and a conceptual conversion of flow currency in NEA. By taking a river ecosystem intercepted by dam construction as an example, risk propagation between all functional guilds of the ecosystem concerning both direct risk and integral risk dynamic were quantified and illustrated in the network model. The results of this new risk assessment showed that there were significant differences between network integral risk and input risk, and although the phytoplankton received the instantaneous impact of chromium pollution among all the functional guilds, it was the piscivorous fish which obtain the greatest overall risk threat. On the basis of the model results, we proposed the network-based indicators for assessing the system-wide risk condition and component-specific risk scenarios of disturbed ecosystems exposed to single or multiple stressors. This study could provide a novel perspective and methodology for assessing ecological risk at the system scale, and concurrently, serve as an elicitation of how we can effectively evaluate ecosystems on the same analytic basis of information-based networks.

Areas with no roads or little traffic (roadless and low-traffic areas) represent relatively undisturbed natural habitats and functioning ecosystems. They provide many benefits for biodiversity and human societies (e.g., landscape connectivity, barrier against pests and invasions, ecosystem services). Roadless and low-traffic areas, with a lower level of anthropogenic disturbances, are of special relevance in Europe because of their rarity and, in the context of climate change, because of their contribution to higher resilience and buffering capacity within landscape ecosystems. An analysis of European legal instruments illustrates that, although most laws aimed at protecting targets which are inherent to fragmentation, like connectivity, ecosystem processes or integrity, roadless areas are widely neglected as a legal target. A case study in Germany underlines this finding. Although the Natura 2000 network covers a significant proportion of the country (16%), Natura 2000 sites are highly fragmented and most low-traffic areas (75%) lie unprotected outside this network. This proportion is even higher for the old Federal States (western Germany), where only 20% of the low-traffic areas are protected. We propose that the few remaining roadless and low-traffic areas in Europe should be an important focus of conservation efforts; they should be urgently inventoried, included more explicitly in the law and accounted for in transport and urban planning.

This suggests that closing time strongly depends on pollinators. Using plant-pollinator interaction webs we further demonstrate that the daily pattern of flower opening and the rapid response to pollination can impose strong temporal dynamics on interspecific interactions within a single day.

The strength of the trophic link between any given pair of species in a food web is likely to depend on the presence and/or densities of other species in the community. How these trophic interaction modifications (TIMs) interact with one another to produce a net modifying effect is an important but under-explored issue. 2. We review several specific types of TIMs that are well understood to address whether the magnitude of the net modification changes with the number of modifiers, and whether modifiers usually increase or decrease each other's effects. 3. Modifications of interactions are generally not independent. It is likely that TIMs interact antagonistically in the majority of cases; the magnitudes of TIMs decrease as more modifiers are added, or new TIMs reduce the magnitudes of modifications that are already present. 4. Individual modifications are likely to have a smaller effect in many-species systems than expected from independent combination of modifications measured in systems with relatively few species. Thus, models that lack explicit TIMs may in some cases yield adequate predictions for species-level perturbations, provided that the net effects of TIMs are implicitly included in measured interaction strengths. 5. Many types of TIMs share structural similarities. Nevertheless, a complete understanding of their effects may require theory that distinguishes different 'functional groups' of modifiers and addresses how these are structured according to trophic relationships.",,,,"Abrams, Peter A/A-5240-2008","Abrams, Peter A/0000-0002-1828-326X; Golubski, Antonio/0000-0002-7069-0284",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8790,1365-2656,,,,SEP,2011,80,5,,,,,1097,1108,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2011.01852.x,,,,,,,WOS:000293176400021,21561452,,,,,

Habitat quality is not easily directly assessed within these complex systems, necessitating the identification of indicator species. This can be done using the IndVal technique, which identifies ecological indicators based on a site typology (e.g. habitat type or disturbance state). We used the extensive South African ENs of natural grassland within an exotic timber plantation matrix as a model system. Grasshoppers were used as potential indicators, as they are sensitive to habitat characteristics of ENs. Multivariate ordination techniques, cluster analyses and IndVal analyses were used to arrive at a site typology with associated indicator species. We retroactively associated these site types to their distinguishing variables. Eleven of 24 grasshopper species were effective indicators of characteristics of ENs, particularly grass height, number of years since last burn, bare ground and EN context. With the inclusion of more variables, site separation became more complete. Validating the selected indicator species on an independent dataset, three species were identified as indicative of high-quality habitat. We conclude that, while grasshoppers are sensitive indicators of habitat quality in ENs, small datasets are insufficient to detect these changes. Furthermore, grasshopper collection as an assessment technique of ENs may only be practicable as long as the bioindication system is developed from a large enough dataset as determined by species accumulation curves.

Thus, constraints on spatial connectivity may have important implications for predator-prey coexistence. We tested the hypothesis that metapopulation dynamics of Ambystoma tigrinum (tiger salamander) depend on combined effects of predatory fish and spatial connectivity. Because matrix heterogeneity can influence dispersal, we also considered how a proximate constraint on amphibian dispersal-desiccation risk-scales up to influence metapopulation dynamics for A. tigrinum. Occupancy and subsequent turnover patterns were quantified in a network of 90 wetlands for three years in an agricultural landscape in Illinois. Our previous field experiments demonstrated that desiccation risk varies among matrix habitats, and that individuals orient movements towards habitat with low desiccation risk. We used cost-distance modeling to generate a connectivity metric that accounted for desiccation risk. Occupancy and colonization probabilities were related negatively to fish occupancy and positively to connectivity. Matrix structure had a strong influence on colonization, and the connectivity metric based on desiccation risk was a better predictor of colonization than alternative metrics. The positive effect of desiccation-informed connectivity on colonization was strongest in wetlands with fish, indicating matrix composition can moderate the effects of predation on amphibians. We detected a rescue effect in which extinction probability was related negatively to connectivity, and this effect was strongest in sites with fish. The matrix did not have a strong effect on occupancy or extinction probabilities, and we discuss why matrix effects may vary for different aspects of population turnover. Our results suggest effects of fish predators on metapopulation dynamics of amphibians depend on spatial connectivity, and that immigration may be essential for maintaining persistence of amphibians in systems with fish.

Energy flows were estimated by means of an inverse methodology of constrained optimization based on the Minimum Norm criterion, i.e. on the minimization of both the sum of squares of the residuals and of the sum of squares of energy flows. The solution was constrained by a set inequalities, which were derived from general eco-physiological knowledge and site specific data on energy flows. The trophic network was represented by thirty-two nodes, including single-species compartments for the species of high economical or ecological relevance. Mass balance equations were weighted, in order to obtain meaningful results in presence of large differences, up to 5 orders of magnitude, among biomasses. A perturbation technique was applied, with the purpose of reducing the risk of finding solutions heavily affected by the set of constraints and of obtaining a more robust representation of the energy flows. The main patterns of energy flow are consistent with those obtained in previous attempts at modelling the Venice lagoon food web. Micro- and macro-phytobenthos account for the largest fraction of the primary production. Energy is then transferred towards higher trophic levels by means of two main pathways: the recycling of dead biomass through the detritus compartment and the direct consumption by grazers. The first pathway is the most important and accounts for approximately two/thirds of the energy transferred to the second trophic level. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

For processing the pulp wasps need water, which is collected by water foragers, and it is transferred to pulp foragers indirectly via a common stomach. The common stomach is formed by generalist wasps that can engage in water exchange and can store water in their crops. Our goal is to provide an alternative model for regulating task partitioning in construction behavior, focusing on worker connectivity instead of using threshold curves to model mechanisms of colony-level regulation. We propose that the existence of an information center and of a network of worker interactions, which establish sets of positive and negative feedbacks, allow collective regulation of colony-wide behaviors. Using a Stock and Flow modeling framework, we illustrate that the common stomach could serve both as a temporal storage for water and also as a source of information about the colony's current demands related to nest construction tasks. Our model predicts that assessing colony needs via individual interactions with the common stomach leads to a robust regulation of task partitioning in construction behavior. Using perturbation experiments in our simulations, we show that this emergent task allocation is able to dynamically adapt to perturbations of the environment and to changes in colony-level demands or population structure. Our model closely mimics and predicts the behavior of Metapolybia wasps, demonstrating that the regulation mechanism based on worker connectivity through a common stomach is a plausible hypothesis for the organization of collective behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1045-2249,1465-7279,,,,JUL-AUG,2011,22,4,,,,,819,830,,10.1093/beheco/arr060,,,,,,,WOS:000291750000019,,,,,,

To address effects of land use and human overexploitation on wildlife populations, it is essential to better understand how human activities have changed species composition, diversity and functioning. Theoretical studies modelled how network properties change under human-induced, non-random species loss. However, we lack data on realistic species-loss sequences in threatened, real-world food webs to parameterize these models. 2. Here, we present a first size-structured topological food web of one of the most pristine terrestrial ecosystems in the world, the Serengeti ecosystem (Tanzania). The food web consists of 95 grouped nodes and includes both invertebrates and vertebrates ranging from body masses between 10-7 and 104 kg. 3. We study the topological changes in this food web that result from the simulated IUCN-based species-loss sequence representing current species vulnerability to human disturbances in and around this savanna ecosystem. We then compare this realistic extinction scenario with other extinction sequences based on body size and connectance and perform an analysis of robustness of this savanna food web. 4. We demonstrate that real-world species loss in this case starts with the biggest (mega) herbivores and top predators, causing higher predator-prey mass ratios. However, unlike theoretically modelled linear species deletion sequences, this causes poor-connected species to be lost first, while more highly connected species become lost as human impact progresses. This food web shows high robustness to decreasing body size and increasing connectance deletion sequences compared with a high sensitivity to the decreasing connectance deletion scenario. 5. Furthermore, based on the current knowledge of the Serengeti ecosystem, we discuss how the focus on food web topology alone, disregarding nontrophic interactions, may lead to an underestimation of human impacts on wildlife communities, with the number of trophic links affected by a factor of two. 6.

We use a simulation model that integrates insights from life-history theory, animal personalities, network theory, and spatial ecology to derive a new mechanism for explaining variation in animal invasion success. We show that spread occurs most rapidly when (1) a species includes a mix of life-history or personality types that differ in density-dependent performance and dispersal tendencies, (2) the differences between types are of intermediate magnitude, and (3) patch connections are intermediate in number and widely spread. Within-species polymorphism in phenotype (e.g., life-history strategies or personality), a feature not included in previous models, is important for overcoming the fact that different traits are associated with success in different stages of the invasion process. Polymorphism in sociability (a personality type) increases the speed of the invasion front, since asocial individuals colonize empty patches and facilitate the local growth of social types that, in turn, induce faster dispersal by asocials at the invasion edge.

(2) A single MPA located at a feeding area. (3) A single MPA designed to maximise its overlap with the predominant route of fish dispersal. (4) The use of two MPAs. Each scenario was replicated with two scenarios regarding the time that fish remains within the MPA and two grid map scenarios to account for time-space effects and map/coastline characteristics. Results showed that overall closing an area increased fish biomass. However, an MPA located in the open sea for a limited time may have adverse effects on fish biomass. MPAs increased fish catches when a single large MPA or two small MPAs were located in the open sea for a limited time. The effects of time that fish remains protected in closed areas vary in combination with the spatial design: When examining time effects on the efficacy of MPAs within each scenario with an MPA located in the open sea, fish biomass was always higher in the case where fish was protected for more calendar days during each year. When comparing between different spatial designs, proximity to the coast was a more predominant factor in the efficacy of MPAs rather than time that fish was protected. The scenario that gave the highest total fish biomass was the one that covered the largest part of the migration route, despite increased edge effects.

However, false absences and missing data can lead to underestimates of the number of sites contributing to connectivity, resulting in overestimates of dispersal ability and turnovers (extinctions plus colonizations). We extend estimation methods for the IFM by using a hierarchical Bayesian model to account both for false absences due to imperfect detection and for missing data due to sites not surveyed in some years. We compare parameter estimates, measures of metapopulation dynamics, and forecasts using stochastic patch occupancy models (SPOMs) among three IFM models: (1) a Bayesian formulation assuming no false absences and omitting site-year combinations with missing data; (2) a hierarchical Bayesian formulation assuming no false absences but incorporating missing data; and (3) a hierarchical Bayesian formulation allowing for imperfect detection and incorporating missing data. We fit the models to multiyear data sets of occupancy for two bird species that differ in body size and presumed dispersal ability but inhabit the same network of sites: the small Black Rail (Laterallus jamaicensis) and the medium-sized Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola). Incorporating missing data affected colonization parameters and led to lower estimates of dispersal ability for the Black Rail. Detection rates were high for the Black Rail in most years but moderate for the Virginia Rail. Incorporating imperfect detection resulted in higher occupancy and lower turnover rates for both species, with largest effects for the Virginia Rail. Forecasts using SPOMs were sensitive to both missing data and false absences; persistence in models assuming no false absences was more optimistic than from robust models.

Communication among cells, tissues and organ systems is essential for survival. Vertebrate and invertebrate animals rely primarily on three physiological systems for intra-organismal communication: the nervous, endocrine and immune systems. Rather than acting independently of one another, these systems communicate in an integrated fashion to coordinate suites of species-appropriate physiological and behavioural responses. 2. Our understanding of how these three systems are coordinated remains incomplete, in part because the importance of the immune system as part of this regulatory network has only recently been recognized. In contrast to the well-established integrative approach to the study of the endocrine and nervous systems, the study of immunity has traditionally occurred in relative isolation from other physiological systems. Immunity was typically considered to be largely buffered from environmental perturbations. 3. In the last several decades, however, this simplistic view has changed dramatically; we now know that a wide variety of extrinsic and intrinsic factors can affect immune responses (reviewed in: Ader, Felten & Cohen 2001). This altered perspective has led to the development of new scientific disciplines including psychoneuroimmunology (Ader & Cohen 1981) and ecological immunology (Sheldon & Verhulst 1996). 4.

Dispersed off-highway vehicle (OHV; e. g., four-wheelers and snowmachines) activity on rural road networks creates a disturbance that reduces the effective amount of wildlife habitat and therefore has the potential for an extensive road-effect zone. Consequently, land managers must consider the trade-offs between rural road development and the conservation of habitat for species of concern. We conducted a spatially-explicit study of moose, Alces alces, occurrence in relation to rural roads and OHV routes in rural Alaska, U. S. A. We used logistic regression and AIC model selection criterion to develop resource selection functions (RSFs) for male and female moose at three spatial scales (250 m, 500 m, and 1000 m) in two seasons (summer and fall). To evaluate an ecological disturbance threshold from increasing route activity on the probability of animal occurrence, the RSFs were plotted against an index of route activity derived from interviews with OHV users, and fit with logarithmic functions. The variable for route activity improved the fit of RSF models for both sexes at all spatial scales and in both seasons. A negative relationship was found between moose occurrence and routes or areas in which routes were in close proximity to primary forage, with the exception of male moose at the 1000-m scale in the fall. Therefore, among the spatial scales of analysis, the road-effect zone for male moose was determined to be between 500 m and 1000 m, and >1000 m for female moose. Furthermore, route activity <0.25 km of vehicle travel/km(2)/day was a threshold value at which moose sustained a high probability of occurrence (0.60 to 0.91). The results of our study suggest that the dispersed ecological effect of rural roads and OHV routes should be considered in transportation and land-management planning efforts. Relatively low levels of vehicular activity may create extensive road-effect zones for sensitive species.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2150-8925,,,,,FEB,2011,2,2,,,,,,,16,10.1890/ES10-00093.1,,,,,,,WOS:000208810300004,,,,,,

There are growing concerns that these kinds of disturbances alter important functions of ecosystems. Our current understanding is that key parameters of a community (e.g. its functional diversity, species composition, and presence/absence of vulnerable species) reflect an ecological network's ability to resist or rebound from change in response to pressures and disturbances, such as species loss. If the food web structure is relatively simple, we can analyse the roles of different species interactions in determining how environmental impacts translate into species loss. However, when ecosystems harbour species-rich communities, as is the case in most natural systems, then the complex network of ecological interactions makes it a far more challenging task to perceive how species' functional roles influence the consequences of species loss. One approach to deal with such complexity is to focus on the functional traits of species in order to identify their respective roles: for instance, large species seem to be more susceptible to extinction than smaller species. Here, we introduce and analyse the marine food web from the high Antarctic Weddell Sea Shelf to illustrate the role of species traits in relation to network robustness of this complex food web. Our approach was threefold: firstly, we applied a new classification system to all species, grouping them by traits other than body size; secondly, we tested the relationship between body size and food web parameters within and across these groups and finally, we calculated food web robustness. We addressed questions regarding (i) patterns of species functional/trophic roles, (ii) relationships between species functional roles and body size and (iii) the role of species body size in terms of network robustness.

Many metapopulation models, including those of coastal benthic organisms under marine reserve scenarios, have assumed a particular and time-independent dispersal pattern. The behavior of such models, however, may be sensitive to more realistic representations of oceanic dispersal. We examine the importance of environmental variability and dispersal characters for metapopulation persistence using a space-limited metapopulation model, in which the dispersal phase is represented by a connectivity matrix and environmental fluctuations by stochastic perturbations of adult abundances. The model is suited to marine organisms, but the same principles apply to other systems. When dispersal is asymmetrical, as expected in the presence of a dominant current, environmental variability can allow the metapopulation to persist, even when the per capita larval production rate is too low to otherwise sustain the population. This suggests that metapopulations inhabiting finite ranges in an advective environment may be more susceptible to variations related to climate change. Generalized stability theory is a powerful tool for identifying the local populations that have greatest impact on the metapopulation, and hence the optimal sites for protection from exploitation. We show that the inclusion of realistic environmental variability and complex dispersal patterns in models of marine reserve networks can bring unsuspected and sometimes largely positive effects for conservation and management of benthic species. Thus, marine reserve monitoring of abundance and recruitment in systems with longshore currents should include the region of long-distance dispersal of the species.",,,,"Aiken, Christopher/G-3754-2019; Navarrete, Sergio/D-4645-2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,2011,428,,,,,,77,88,,10.3354/meps09079,,,,,,,WOS:000290248800006,,,,,,

Recently, network analyses revealed that mutualistic relationships between fleshy-fruited plants and frugivores are mostly built upon generalized associations. However, little is known about the determinants of network structure, especially from tropical forests where plants' dependence on animal seed dispersal is particularly high. Here, we present an in-depth analysis of specialization and interaction strength in a plant-frugivore network from a Kenyan rain forest. We recorded fruit removal from 33 plant species in different forest strata (canopy, midstory, understory) and habitats (primary and secondary forest) with a standardized sampling design (3447 interactions in 924 observation hours). We classified the 88 frugivore species into guilds according to dietary specialization (14 obligate, 28 partial, 46 opportunistic frugivores) and forest dependence (50 forest species, 38 visitors). Overall, complementary specialization was similar to that in other plant-frugivore networks. However, the plant-frugivore interactions in the canopy stratum were less specialized than in the mid-and understory, whereas primary and secondary forest did not differ. Plant specialization on frugivores decreased with plant height, and obligate and partial frugivores were less specialized than opportunistic frugivores. The overall impact of a frugivore increased with the number of visits and the specialization on specific plants. Moreover, interaction strength of frugivores differed among forest strata. Obligate frugivores foraged in the canopy where fruit resources were abundant, whereas partial and opportunistic frugivores were more common on mid-and understory plants, respectively. We conclude that the vertical stratification of the frugivore community into obligate and opportunistic feeding guilds structures this plant-frugivore network. The canopy stratum comprises stronger links and generalized associations, whereas the lower strata are composed of weaker links and more specialized interactions. Our results suggest that seed-dispersal relationships of plants in lower forest strata are more prone to disruption than those of canopy trees.",,,,"Schleuning, Matthias/H-2154-2015; Bluthgen, Nico/F-5983-2010; Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/W-2601-2019","Schleuning, Matthias/0000-0001-9426-045X; Bohning-Gaese, Katrin/0000-0003-0477-5586",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,1939-9170,,,,JAN,2011,92,1,,,,,26,36,,10.1890/09-1842.1,,,,,,,WOS:000289552200005,21560673,,,,,

It is unclear, however, how different habitat types compare. Using large-scale field surveys, we compared the canopy and community structure between eelgrass and rockweed beds in Atlantic Canada and assessed their nitrogen retention, carbon storage, and habitat services. We then used binary network models of predator-prey interactions to determine food-web structure and its robustness to species loss. Despite disparate 3-dimensional canopy structure, both habitats significantly enhanced overall abundance and diversity of associated flora and fauna, including several commercially important species. Significant differences occurred in the species assemblages within and between habitats and were attributed to different settlement opportunities, food availability, predation risk, and maneuverability. While eelgrass plants had higher nitrogen content, rockweed canopies maintained 8-fold greater biomass and, thus, 14-fold greater nitrogen and 8-fold greater carbon retention per unit area. Both rockweed and eelgrass food webs showed similarities to other temperate and tropical seagrass webs, yet their robustness to the loss of most connected species including primary producers was among the lowest; underscoring their vulnerability to disturbances affecting the functionally dominant primary producers. The present study demonstrates that marine vegetation provides important habitat, nitrogen, and carbon storage services, yet the extent of these services depends on the foundation species and its architecture. Changes in canopy structure will therefore have profound effects on associated food webs and ecosystem services. Thus, as increasing human pressures on coastal ecosystems threaten the continued supply of essential functions and services, the protection of marine vegetated habitats should be a management priority.",,,,"Romanuk, t N/C-6493-2008; Coll, Marta/A-9488-2012","Coll, Marta/0000-0001-6235-5868",,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,2011,437,,,,,,51,68,,10.3354/meps09276,,,,,,,WOS:000295342600005,,,,,,

However, habitat quality also can influence occupancy dynamics, especially in patchy systems where habitat selection can be as important as stochastic demographic processes. We studied the spatial population dynamics of Chrysemys picta (painted turtle) in a network of 90 wetlands in Illinois, USA from 2007 to 2009. We first evaluated the relative influence of metapopulation factors (area, isolation) and habitat quality of focal patches on occupancy and turnover. Next, we tested the effect of habitat quality of source patches on occupancy and turnover at focal patches. Turnover was common with colonizations (n = 16) outnumbering extinctions (n = 10) between the first 2 years, and extinctions (n = 16) outnumbering colonizations (n = 3) between the second 2 years. Both metapopulation and habitat quality factors influenced C. picta occupancy dynamics. Colonization probability was related positively to spatial connectivity, wetland area, and habitat quality (wetland inundation, emergent vegetation cover). Extinction probability was related negatively to wetland area and emergent vegetation cover. Habitat quality of source patches strongly influenced initial occupancy but not turnover patterns. Because habitat quality for freshwater turtles is related to wetland hydrology, a change from drought to wet conditions during our study likely influenced distributional shifts. Thus, effects of habitat quality of source and focal patches on occupancy can vary in space and time. Both metapopulation and habitat quality factors may be needed to understand occupancy dynamics, even for species exhibiting patchy population structures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0921-2973,,,,,DEC,2010,25,10,,,,,1589,1600,,10.1007/s10980-010-9529-3,,,,,,,WOS:000283371000010,,,,,,

We also studied whether total interaction frequency is partitioned more evenly among individual links in richer webs. Our results reveal a direct effect of area on the number of links and species present in each pollination web. However, link richness increased twofold faster than species richness with area. These area effects were not confounded by sampling effort or correlated incidence of exotic species, despite widespread habitat disturbance. Habitat proximity, an inverse measure of isolation, had a marginally significant influence on link but not on species richness.

Whilst the physiological effects of elevated temperatures are well documented in these species, knowledge at the molecular level is scant and hence our understanding of the cellular response is still limited. To increase our knowledge in this area, a cDNA microarray consisting of 8448 clones was constructed to study the heat stress response of Laternula elliptica, an infaunal Antarctic bivalve. Eight clams were exposed to 12 h heat stress at 3 degrees C and their gene expression profiles were individually compared to a pooled reference of non heat shocked clams.

The status of the sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) population has become a serious concern among the lake managers and policy makers during the last decades. While the decline of the sockeye salmon population has been well documented in Lake Toya, there is considerable uncertainty with regards to the impact on the broader system dynamics. In this study, our objective is to address this knowledge gap by undertaking a synthesis of the Lake Toya food web using the mass-balance modeling software Ecopath with Ecosim (EWE). Our primary research question is to examine the repercussions of the declining sockeye salmon population on the trophic dynamics of the lake. Namely, we assess if there are any competing species that might have benefited from the decrease of sockeye salmon standing biomass and to what extent do these changes propagate through the Lake Toya food web? Our analysis pinpoints the critical role of the Japanese smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus nipponensis) in the system, which demonstrates a wide range of effects on several functional groups at both higher and lower trophic levels in Lake Toya. In particular, being a substantial portion of the masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) and adult sockeye salmon diets, the Japanese smelt has a positive impact on the top predators of the system. Amphipods, insects, and shrimp strongly benefit from the autochthonous and allochthonous organic matter in the system, while the tight coupling between phytoplankton and zooplankton seems to be particularly critical for the integrity of the Lake Toya food web. Whereas the values of the different ecosystem attributes (e.g., primary production/biomass, biomass/total throughput, system omnivory index, amount of recycled throughput, Finn's cycling index) provide evidence that Lake Toya is an immature system, we note that the internal redundancy and the system overhead estimates suggest that the lake possesses substantial reserves to overcome external perturbations. We also examined the effects of a variety of fishing policies on the biomass of masu salmon and adult sockeye salmon, which verify the belief that the adult sockeye population is quite fragile with high likelihood to collapse. Our analysis also predicts that sockeye will not rebound unless the fishing pressure exerted is substantially reduced (>50% of the reference levels used). Masu salmon seems to benefit under all the scenarios examined indicating that the intensity of the current fishing activities is significantly lower than its biomass accumulation rate in the system.

There is, however, no experimental evidence that such predator aggregations are governed by intrinsic social systems, demonstrating long-term temporal stability. Social network structure, temporal stability, and activity profiles were analyzed to examine the impact of introduced males on social structure of 4 captive groups of female catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). Aside from foraging and habitat selection pressures, we question whether individual female sharks manage additional social demands that potentially influence activity budget and susceptibility to male harassment. Shark groups demonstrated marked differences in their tendency to aggregate in a unisex environment and concomitantly showed significant differences in social response to male presence. Dichotomy in social structure of the 4 groups revealed that well-connected individuals demonstrated greater resilience to male disturbance. Socially isolated females experienced greater levels of partner exchange, reduced temporal stability, and increased activity levels in the presence of males and control females. These results are the first to demonstrate the disruptive influence that male and novel females have on weak female shark social interactions; conversely, aggregations demonstrating relatively strong temporally stable social bonds (at least by some individuals) are particularly resilient to potential male harassment and novel (female) intruders.

We examined the contribution of three different habitat types (farmland, forest edge, forest understory) to bee diversity in a tropical forest-agriculture mosaic in Western Kenya and analysed differences and overlap in plant-bee community interactions between nearby habitats. We used network properties (network size and specialization indices) and bee species turnover to examine temporal and spatial variation of flower-visitation interaction networks in general and in bee species composition in detail across habitats. In total we found 121 bee and 89 plant species involved in the interactions. Results suggest that bees were limited by floral resources because the largest networks, highest diversity, and largest abundances were found at the forest edge and in the farmland which hosted higher amounts of flowers and a more homogeneous distribution of resources in space and time. Forest in the study area is characterized by (1) lower flower density and (2) more humid conditions relative to the farmland. We therefore suggest that the species-rich and structurally diverse farmland acts as a pollinator rescue which supports bee communities in the natural forest. We advise conservation managers and politicians to conserve the structural richness of the farmland to (1) preserve bee diversity within the farmland and (2) conserve positive effects of the farmland on bee activity in the forest remnant.

In both designs, a food web approach was used to evaluate both structural and functional aspects of the restoration.

The loss of biodiversity caused by agricultural expansion can be countered by adopting wildlife-friendly farming strategies and by expanding the network of nature reserves. The potential benefits of agricultural extensification, represented in Europe by agri-environmental schemes, still remain unclear. In particular, the effectiveness of preserving linear woody vegetation to retain forest carnivores in farmland has received limited attention. We document the value of hedgerows and narrow strips of riparian forest for the Egyptian mongoose Herpestes ichneumon and the common genet Genetta genetta. 2. In an agricultural mosaic of southern Spain containing 4 center dot 7% of woody vegetation, we tested hypotheses about the role of linear elements and three farmland types differing in the amount, quality and structure of woody cover. We analysed the influence of linear elements on the placement and utilization of home ranges by combining compositional analysis and numerical methods. 3. Mongooses and genets strongly selected linear woody vegetation. All types of farmland, including open fields, dehesa (savanna-like pastureland or arable land rich in oak trees Quercus ilex and Q. suber) and olive Olea europaea groves, were avoided, suggesting that both species strictly depend upon native woody cover. 4. Most individuals made regular use of hedgerows and some individuals used hedgerows as the only source of woody cover in their home ranges. 5. The distribution of home ranges suggested that individuals made up a continuous, rather than discrete, population in a spatially structured habitat. An evenly distributed hedgerow network across the intervening agricultural matrix could prevent population fragmentation. 6. Synthesis and applications. A suitable network of linear cover allows some forest carnivores to survive in agricultural landscapes containing a low proportion (< 10%) of native woody vegetation. Length (> 0 center dot 5 km), width (4-10 m), quality (continuous native shrubs, scattered native trees, low levels of human disturbance), density (10-50 m ha-1) and a regular distribution of linear features are key elements in the conservation or restoration of agricultural landscapes where the preservation of small forest carnivores is an objective.",,,,"Rodriguez, Alejandro/E-7709-2011","Rodriguez, Alejandro/0000-0001-9367-3420",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,,,,,JUN,2010,47,3,,,,,611,620,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01804.x,,,,,,,WOS:000277168000013,,,,,,

We used two qualitative and quantitative pollination networks to simulate extinction patterns following three removal scenarios: random removal and systematic removal of the strongest and weakest interactors. We accounted for pollinator behaviour by including potential links into temporal snapshots (12 consecutive 2-week networks) to reflect mutualists' ability to 'switch' interaction partners (re-wiring). Qualitative data suggested a linear or slower than linear secondary extinction while quantitative data showed sigmoidal decline of plant interaction strength upon removal of the strongest interactor. Temporal snapshots indicated greater stability of re-wired networks over static systems. Tolerance of generalized networks to species extinctions was high in the random removal scenario, with an increase in network stability if species formed new interactions. Anthropogenic disturbance, however, that promote the extinction of the strongest interactors might induce a sudden collapse of pollination networks.",,,,"Kaiser-Bunbury, Christopher/C-5038-2012; Caflisch, Amedeo/I-3459-2012","Kaiser-Bunbury, Christopher/0000-0001-7254-3491; Muff, Stefanie/0000-0002-8425-0757",,,,,,,,,,,,1461-023X,1461-0248,,,,APR,2010,13,4,,,,,442,452,,10.1111/j.1461-0248.2009.01437.x,,,,,,,WOS:000275635400004,20100244,,,,,

Changes in forest structure, composition, and dynamics inevitably lead to changes in the biodiversity of forest-dwelling species. The possible biodiversity gains and losses due to forest management (i.e., anthropogenic pressures related to direct forest resource use), however, have never been assessed at a pan-European scale. We used meta-analysis to review 49 published papers containing 120 individual comparisons of species richness between unmanaged and managed forests throughout Europe. We explored the response of different taxonomic groups and the variability of their response with respect to time since abandonment and intensity of forest management. Species richness was slightly higher in unmanaged than in managed forests. Species dependent on forest cover continuity, deadwood, and large trees (bryophytes, lichens, fungi, saproxylic beetles) and carabids were negatively affected by forest management. In contrast, vascular plant species were favored. The response for birds was heterogeneous and probably depended more on factors such as landscape patterns. The global difference in species richness between unmanaged and managed forests increased with time since abandonment and indicated a gradual recovery of biodiversity. Clearcut forests in which the composition of tree species changed had the strongest effect on species richness, but the effects of different types of management on taxa could not be assessed in a robust way because of low numbers of replications in the management-intensity classes. Our results show that some taxa are more affected by forestry than others, but there is a need for research into poorly studied species groups in Europe and in particular locations. Our meta-analysis supports the need for a coordinated European research network to study and monitor the biodiversity of different taxa in managed and unmanaged forests.",,,,"Magura, Tibor/I-4383-2019; Matesanz, Silvia/U-3009-2019; De Bruyn, Luc/C-7030-2008; Odor, Peter/ABE-3552-2020; Paillet, Yoan/N-2231-2019; Matesanz, Silvia/L-5153-2014; Sebastia, M.

Although morphologic evolution due to channel incision has been documented and modeled by others, ecological effects, particularly water quality effects, are less well understood. Discharge, basic physical parameters, solids, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), chlorophyll and bacteria were monitored for five years at two sites along a stream in a mixed-cover watershed characterized by rapid incision of the entire channel network. Concurrent data were collected from two sites on a nearby stream draining a watershed of similar size and cultivation intensity, but without widespread incision. Data sets describing physical aquatic habitat and fish fauna of each stream were available from other studies. The second stream was impacted by watershed urbanization, but was not incised, so normal channel-floodplain interaction maintained a buffer zone of floodplain wetlands between the study reach and the urban development upstream. The incised stream had mean channel depth and width that were 1.8 and 3.5 times as large as for the nonincised stream, and was characterized by flashier hydrology. The median rise rate for the incised stream was 6.4 times as great as for the nonincised stream. Correlation analyses showed that hydrologic perturbations were associated with water quality degradation, and the incised stream had levels of turbidity and solids that were two to three times higher than the nonincised, urbanizing stream. Total phosphorus. total Kjeldahl N, and chlorophyll a concentrations were significantly higher in the incised stream, while nitrate was significantly greater in the nonincised, urbanizing stream (p <= 0.02). Physical aquatic habitat and fish populations in the nonincised urbanizing stream were superior, as it Supported almost twice as many species and yielded more than four times as much biomass per unit of effort. These results suggest that channel incision is associated with a complex of ecological stressors that includes channel erosion, hydrologic perturbation, and water quality and physical habitat degradation. Ecological engineering of stream corridors must focus at least as much energy on mediating hydrologic perturbations and managing habitat quality as on pollutant loadings.

Whilst alteration of flow, sediment, organic matter and thermal regimes interact to reduce biological diversity and the ecological integrity of freshwater ecosystems - and thereby degrade the properties and ecological services most valued by humans - environmental flows' left in rivers, or restored to developed rivers, will sustain many ecological and societal values. The success of river protection and rehabilitation / restoration depends upon understanding and accurately modelling relationships between hydrological patterns, fluvial disturbance and ecological responses in rivers and flood-plains. 3. This Special Issue presents new analytical and modelling approaches to support the development of hydro-ecological models and environmental flow standards at multiple spatial scales - applicable to all rivers in any economic and societal setting. Examples include the new framework Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration (ELOHA) founded on hydrological classification and gradient analysis; ecological trait analysis; Bayesian hierarchical modelling; Bayesian Decision Networks; and Integrated Basin Flow Assessment (IBFA). 4.

A strategic component of the vision is the adoption of the systems biology approach to acquire, analyze, and interpret toxicity pathway data. As key toxicity pathways are identified and their wiring details elucidated using traditional and high-throughput techniques, there is a pressing need to understand their qualitative and quantitative behaviors in response to perturbation by both physiological signals and exogenous stressors. The complexity of these molecular networks makes the task of understanding cellular responses merely by human intuition challenging, if not impossible. This process can be aided by mathematical modeling and computer simulation of the networks and their dynamic behaviors. A number of theoretical frameworks were developed in the last century for understanding dynamical systems in science and engineering disciplines. These frameworks, which include metabolic control analysis, biochemical systems theory, nonlinear dynamics, and control theory, can greatly facilitate the process of organizing, analyzing, and understanding toxicity pathways. Such analysis will require a comprehensive examination of the dynamic properties of network motifs-the basic building blocks of molecular circuits. Network motifs like feedback and feedforward loops appear repeatedly in various molecular circuits across cell types and enable vital cellular functions like homeostasis, all-or-none response, memory, and biological rhythm. These functional motifs and associated qualitative and quantitative properties are the predominant source of nonlinearities observed in cellular dose response data. Complex response behaviors can arise from toxicity pathways built upon combinations of network motifs. While the field of computational cell biology has advanced rapidly with increasing availability of new data and powerful simulation techniques, a quantitative orientation is still lacking in life sciences education to make efficient use of these new tools to implement the new toxicity testing paradigm. A revamped undergraduate curriculum in the biological sciences including compulsory courses in mathematics and analysis of dynamical systems is required to address this gap. In parallel, dissemination of computational systems biology techniques and other analytical tools among practicing toxicologists and risk assessment professionals will help accelerate implementation of the new toxicity testing vision.",,,,"Andersen, Melvin E/K-5179-2012; Andersen, Melvin/S-6646-2019","Andersen, Melvin E/0000-0002-3894-4811; Andersen, Melvin/0000-0002-3894-4811; Bhattacharya, Sudin/0000-0002-2360-1672",,,,,,,,,,,,1093-7404,1521-6950,,,,,2010,13,2-4,,,SI,,253,276,,10.1080/10937404.2010.483943,,,,,,,WOS:000279063400008,20574901,,,,,

Although road mortality has the potential to affect the fate of populations, it is often confounded with other forms of environmental change. Therefore determining its impact separately from other factors is difficult because it requires an understanding of how road mortalities affect age- and sex-specific survival rates. Aims. We determined the impact of high numbers of road-kills and habitat modification on the growth and survival of the population of tammar wallabies (Macropus eugenii) on Garden Island, off the coast of Western Australia. The increased supply of food from large areas of fertilised and irrigated lawns on a naval base was expected to increase the population growth rate (lambda) and the road-kills were expected to offset the population response. Methods. We conducted a mark-and-recapture study over three years to estimate rates of survival, reproduction and population growth rates in areas of the island that were either heavily affected by the presence of a naval base that included a network of roads and buildings, close enough to the naval base that animals could be affected by the disturbance there, and completely unaffected and lacking major roads or buildings. All road-kills were collected to estimate the impact of road mortality on the survival and growth rates of the population. Key results. The growth rate, lambda, for the population on the naval base was 1.02 +/- 0.083 (s.e.) per year, which was much higher than in an area of adjacent bushland at 0.92 +/- 0.065 per year and in undisturbed bushland at 0.93 +/- 0.100 per year. When the impact of road mortality was removed, lambda increased to 1.15 +/- 0.101 per year on the naval base and 0.96 +/- 0.076 per year in the bushland adjacent to the naval base. On the naval base road mortality reduced survival rates of one-year-old and adult animals by 0.14 +/- 0.087 and 0.12 +/- 0.012 per year (mean +/- s.e.). Conclusions. Road mortality counteracted the increase in the size of the tammar population caused by the habitat modification on the naval base. The impact of road mortality on the adjacent bushland population may result in its long-term decline, as the population may not be able to recover from the reduction in survival rates. Implications. Road mortality has the potential to threaten susceptible populations but its impact should be quantified so that mitigation measures can be implemented where they will achieve the greatest benefits.",,,,"Bencini, Roberta/A-1426-2013; Chambers, Brian/C-3879-2011; Chambers, Brian/P-7320-2019","Bencini, Roberta/0000-0002-6927-5198; ",,,,,,,,,,,,1035-3712,1448-5494,,,,,2010,37,7,,,,,588,596,,10.1071/WR10080,,,,,,,WOS:000285392300007,,,,,,

There are few long-term data on bee populations, which makes their conservation status difficult to assess. The best-studied groups are the genus Bombus (the bumble bees), and bees in the EU generally; both of these are clearly declining. However, it is not known to what extent these groups represent the approximately 20,000 species of bees globally. As is the case for insects in general, bees are underrepresented in conservation planning and protection efforts. For example, only two bee species are on the global IUCN Red List, and no bee is listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, even though many bee species are known to be in steep decline or possibly extinct. At present, bee restoration occurs mainly in agricultural contexts, funded by government programs such as agri-environment schemes (EU) and the Farm Bill (USA). This is a promising approach given that many bee species can use human-disturbed habitats, and bees provide valuable pollination services to crops. However, agricultural restorations only benefit species that persist in agricultural landscapes, and they are more expensive than preserving natural habitat elsewhere. Furthermore, such restorations benefit bees in only about half of studied cases. More research is greatly needed in many areas of bee conservation, including basic population biology, bee restoration in nonagricultural contexts, and the identification of disturbance-sensitive bee species.",,,,"borba, jared/D-6810-2015",,,,,,,,,,,,,0077-8923,,978-1-57331-791-7,,,,2010,1195,,,,,,169,197,,10.1111/j.1749-6632.2010.05449.x,,,,,,,WOS:000282828200010,20536823,,,,,

On the basis of species-host area equations, parameterized with data from the literature and interviews with botanical experts, I estimated the number of specialized plant-feeding insects (i.e., monophages) that live in 34 biodiversity hotspots and the number committed to extinction because of habitat loss. I estimated that 795,971-1,602,423 monophagous insect species live in biodiversity hotspots on 150,371 endemic plant species, which is 5.3-10.6 monophages per plant species. I calculated that 213,830-547,500 monophagous species are committed to extinction in biodiversity hotspots because of reduction of the geographic range size of their endemic hosts. I provided rankings of biodiversity hotspots on the basis of estimated richness of monophagous insects and on estimated number of extinctions of monophagous species. Extinction rates were predicted to be higher in biodiversity hotspots located along strong environmental gradients and on archipelagos, where high spatial turnover of monophagous species along the geographic distribution of their endemic plants is likely. The results strongly support the overall strategy of selecting priority conservation areas worldwide primarily on the basis of richness of endemic plants.

We explored two inter-related extensions of hierarchical system theory with our food web; the first one was that subsystems react to perturbations independently in the short-term and the second one was that a system's properties change at a slower rate than its subsystems' properties. We used Shannon's equations to provide quantitative versions of the basic food web properties: number of prey, number of predators, number of feeding links, and connectance (or density). We then compared these properties between the two time-periods by developing distributions of each property for each time period that took uncertainty about the property into account. We compared these distributions, and concluded that non-overlapping distributions indicated changes in these properties that were large relative to their uncertainty. Two subsystems were identified within our food web system structure (p < 0.001). One subsystem had more non-overlapping distributions in food web properties between Time 1 and Time 2 than the other subsystem. The overall system had all overlapping distributions in food web properties between Time I and Time 2. These results supported both extensions of hierarchical systems theory. Interestingly, the subsystem with more non-overlapping distributions in food web properties was the subsystem that contained primarily benthic taxa, contrary to expectations that the identified major perturbations (lower phosphorous inputs and invasive species) would more greatly affect the subsystem containing primarily pelagic taxa. Future food-web research should employ rigorous statistical analysis and incorporate uncertainty in food web properties for a better understanding of how ecological networks adapt.

We have previously shown that network analyses are powerful tools for understanding the effects of exotic species perturbation on ecosystems. We now use the network analysis approach to compare how the same perturbation affects another ecosystem of similar trophic status. We compared food web characteristics of the Bay of Quinte, Lake Ontario (Canada), to previous research on Oneida Lake, New York (USA) before and after zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion. We used ecological network analysis (ENA) to rigorously quantify ecosystem function through an analysis of direct and indirect food web transfers. We used a social network analysis method. cohesion analysis (CA), to assess ecosystem structure by organizing food web members into subgroups of strongly interacting predators and prey. Together, ENA and CA allowed us to understand how food web structure and function respond simultaneously to perturbation. In general, zebra mussel effects on the Bay of Quinte, when compared to Oneida Lake, were similar in direction, but greater in magnitude. Both systems underwent functional changes involving focused flow through a small number of taxa and increased use of benthic sources of production; additionally, both systems structurally changed with subgroup membership changing considerably (33% in Oneida Lake) or being disrupted entirely (in the Bay of Quinte). However, the response of total ecosystem activity (as measured by carbon flow) differed between both systems, with increasing activity in the Bay of Quinte, and decreasing activity in Oneida Lake. Thus, these analyses revealed parallel effects of zebra mussel invasion in ecosystems of similar trophic status, yet they also suggested that important differences may exist. As exotic species continue to disrupt the structure and function of our native ecosystems, food web network analyses will be useful for understanding their far-reaching effects.

Yet, few contemporary approaches can assess the effects of exotic species invasion at such an inclusive level. Our research presents one of the first attempts to examine the effects of an exotic species at the ecosystem level in a quantifiable manner. We used ecological network analysis (ENA) and a social network analysis (SNA) method called cohesion analysis to examine the effect of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) invasion on the Oneida Lake, New York, USA, food web. We used ENA to quantify ecosystem function through an analysis of food web carbon transfer that explicitly incorporated flow over all food web paths (direct and indirect). The cohesion analysis assessed ecosystem structure through an organization of food web members into subgroups of strongly interacting predators and prey. Our analysis detected effects of zebra mussel invasion throughout the entire Oneida Lake food web, including changes in trophic flow efficiency (i.e., carbon flow among trophic levels) and alterations of food web organization (i.e., paths of carbon flow) and ecosystem activity (i.e., total carbon flow). ENA indicated that zebra mussels altered food web function by shunting carbon from pelagic to benthic pathways, increasing dissipative flow loss, and decreasing ecosystem activity. SNA revealed the strength of zebra mussel perturbation as evidenced by a reorganization of food web subgroup structure, with a decrease in importance of pelagic pathways, a concomitant rise of benthic pathways, and a reorganization of interactions between top predator fish. Together, these analyses allowed for a holistic understanding of the effects of zebra mussel invasion on the Oneida Lake food web. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

J.; Coll, M.; Neira, S.",,,Exploring the dynamics of ecological indicators using food web models fitted to time series of abundance and catch data,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Previously, standardized snap-shot models of the Southern Benguela (1980-1989), Southern Humboldt (1992) and Southern Catalan Sea (1994) ecosystems were examined and found to facilitate assessment of ecosystem characteristics related to the gradient in exploitation status of the ecosystems; highest level of exploitation in the South Catalan Sea (North-western Mediterranean), high in the Southern Humboldt and lower in the Southern Benguela. Subsequently. these models were calibrated and fitted using available catch, fishing effort/mortality, and abundance data series and incorporated environmental and internal drivers. This study furthers the previous comparative analyses by comparing changes in ecosystem structure using a selection of ecosystem indicators from the calibrated models and assessing how these indicators change over time in these three contrasting ecosystems. Indicators examined include community turnover rates (production/biomass), trophic level of landings and the community, biodiversity indicators, ratios of predatory/forage fish and pelagic/demersal fish biomass, catch ratios, and network analysis indicators. Using the set of model-derived indicators, the three ecosystems were ranked in terms of exploitation level. This ranking was performed using the values of these indicators in recent years (ecosystem state) as well as their trends over time (ecosystem trend). The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Median tests were used to test for significance of the difference between indicators from the three ecosystems in the last 5 years of the Simulation to compare present ecosystem states. We compared the slope of the lineal trend and its significance between ecosystems using the generalized least-squares regression taking auto-correlation into consideration to analyse ecosystem trends. The indicators that capture better the high impacts of fishing prevalent in the Mediterranean and Humboldt ecosystems, and the more conservative exploitation of the Southern Benguela, are the fish/invertebrates biomass and catch ratio, the demersal/pelagic fish biomass and catch ratio (depending on the ecosystem and the fishery being developed), flows to detritus, and the mean trophic level of the community (when large, poorly quantified groups such as zooplankton and detritus are excluded). This study suggests that the best option for classifying ecosystems according to the impact of fishing is to consider a broad range of indicators to understand how and why an ecosystem is responding to particular environmental or fishing drivers (or more likely a combination of these). Our results highlight the importance of including indicators capturing trends over time as well as recent ecosystem states. We also identified 23 pairs of indicators that correlated similarly in the three ecosystems (they showed a significant correlation with same sign). Further comparisons may contribute towards generalization of this list, progressing towards a better understanding of the behaviour of ecological indicators. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We specifically assess projected range changes in relation to the Important Bird Areas (IBAs) network and assess the possible consequences for conservation. Location South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland. Methods The newly emerging ensemble modelling approach is used with 50 species, four climate change models for the period 2070-2100 and eight bioclimatic niche models in the statistical package biomod. Model evaluation is done using the receiver operating characteristic and the recently introduced true skill statistic. Future projections are made considering two extreme assumptions: species have full dispersal ability and species have no dispersal ability. A consensus forecast is identified using principal components analysis. This forecast is interpreted in terms of the IBA network. An irreplaceability analysis is used to highlight priority IBAs for conservation attention in terms of climate change. Results The majority of species (62%) are predicted to lose climatically suitable space. Five species lose at least 85% of their climatically suitable space. Many IBAs lose species (41%; 47 IBAs) and show high rates of species turnover of more than 50% (77%; 95 IBAs). Highly irreplaceable regions for endemic species become highly localized under climate change, meaning that the endemic species analysed here experience similar range contractions to maintain climate niches. Main conclusions The South African IBAs network is likely to become less effective for conserving endemic birds under climate change. The irreplaceability analysis identified key refugia for endemic species under climate change, but many of these areas are not currently IBAs.

J,"Hosack, GR; Eldridge, PM",,,,"Hosack, Geoffrey R.; Eldridge, Peter M.",,,Do microbial processes regulate the stability of a coral atoll's enclosed pelagic ecosystem?,ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,,,,,,,,,,"Complex marine ecosystems contain multiple feedback cycles that can cause unexpected responses to perturbations. To better predict these responses, complicated models are increasingly being developed to enable the study of feedback cycles. However, the sparseness of ecological data often limits the direct empirical parameterization of all model parameters. Here we use a Bayesian inverse analysis approach to synthesize empirical data and ecological theory derived from published studies of a coral atoll's enclosed pelagic ecosystem (Takapoto Atoll, French Polynesia). We then use the estimates of flux magnitudes to parameterize probabilistic compartment models with two forms of heterotrophic consumption: (1) bottom-up donor-controlled heterotrophic consumption and (2) top-down mass-action heterotrophic consumption. We explore how the flux magnitudes affect the ecosystem's stability properties of resilience, reactivity, and resistance under both assumptions for heterotrophic consumption. The models suggest that the microbial uptake of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) regulates the long term rate of return to steady state following a temporary or pulse perturbation (resilience), and the cycling of carbon between abiotic pools and heterotrophic compartments regulates the short-term response (reactivity). In the bottom-up process model, the sensitivity of steady state masses following a sustained or press perturbation (resistance) is highest for the DOC pool following a sustained change to the microbial uptake rate of DOC. Further, a change in the microbial uptake of DOC propagates through the ecosystem and affects the steady state values of zooplankton. The analysis suggests that the food web is highly dependent on the recycling between the abiotic and biotic carbon pools, particularly as mediated by the microbial consumption of DOC, and this recycling determines how the ecosystem responds to perturbations.

Ecopath with Ecosim, was used to construct two ecosystem models (for 1981 and 1998) to characterize the food web structure and functioning of the ecosystem. Pedigree work and simple sensitivity analysis were carried out to evaluate the quality of data and the uncertainty of the models. The two models seem reliable with regards to input data of good quality. Comparing the variations of outputs of these two models aimed to facilitate assessment of changes of the ecosystem during the past two decades. The trophic structure of the ecosystem has changed with an increase in the biomass proportion of lower trophic level (TL) organisms and a decrease in top predator biomass proportion. All the indices of ecosystem maturity examined show that the system was in a more mature condition in 1981 than in 1998, although the system has been in a condition of stress due to anthropogenic disturbances, such as environmental pollution and habitat destruction since 1981. The ecosystem was aggregated into six and seven integral TLs in 1981 and 1998, respectively, using the trophic aggregation routine of Ecopath. Most of the total system biomass and catch took place at TL II and III in both years. But the distribution of the total system biomass and catch at different TLs changed with decreasing proportions in higher TLs in 1998. The mean transfer efficiency was 9.1% and 10.2% in 1981 and 1998, respectively. Comparative network analysis allowed quantification of the importance of direct and indirect trophic interactions among functional groups. Moreover, a method derived from the mixed trophic impact (MTI) analysis allowed estimating importance of groups in terms of keystoneness and identifying the keystone species in the two models over the past two decades. The results indicate that there were no clear keystone species in 1998 but two keystone species at medium trophic levels were identified in 1981. Moreover, organisms located at low trophic levels such as phytoplankton, zooplankton and benthic invertebrates were identified to have relatively high keystoneness in the ecosystem.

We considered two simple proxies of species persistence: a time series of point-count data to calculate abundance and a time series of presence-absence data to calculate permanence (a measure of consistent occupancy over time). Using two 10-year intervals of data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey, we compared the performance of each measure at predicting persistence 18 years later. For nonrare species, abundance and permanence predicted persistence similarly well. We performed complementarity-based reserve selections with data on species abundance and permanence (from 1970 to 1979) and then evaluated the effectiveness of the reserve networks at maintaining species populations and efficiency in land use (data from 1997 to 2006). Abundance proved a better predictor of future local persistence than permanence, which justifies the relatively larger financial and temporal costs of collecting a time series of point-count data to estimate abundance. If future extinction events were used as a measure of reserve-network effectiveness, the performance of abundance and permanence did not differ markedly. Nevertheless, when future abundance, which is a more sensitive measure of network effectiveness, was used, abundance was significantly better than permanence at selecting longer-term, high-quality, species-specific habitat but required larger reserves to do so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0888-8892,1523-1739,,,,OCT,2009,23,5,,,,,1260,1269,,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01253.x,,,,,,,WOS:000269802200029,19500122,,,,,

Given limited resources to set aside protected areas for biodiversity conservation, and competing land uses, a prime consideration for the design of reserve networks is efficiency (the maximum biodiversity represented in a minimum number of sites). However, to be effective, networks may sacrifice efficiency. We used reserve selection algorithms to determine whether collections of existing individual protected areas in Canada were efficient and/or effective in terms of representing the diversity of disturbance-sensitive mammals in Canada in comparison to (1) an optimal network of reserves, and (2) sites selected at random. Unlike previous studies, we restricted our analysis to individual protected areas that met a criterion for minimum reserve size, to address issues of representation and persistence simultaneously. We also tested for effectiveness and efficiency using historical and present-day data to see whether protected area efficiency and/or effectiveness varied over time. In general, existing protected areas did not effectively capture the full suite of mammalian species diversity, nor are most existing protected areas part of a near-optimal solution set. To be effective, Canada's network of reserves will require at minimum 22 additional areas of > 2700 km(2). This study shows that even when only those reserves large enough to be effective are considered, protected areas systems may not be representative, nor were they representative at the time of establishment.

Here, we use microarrays to analyse patterns of gene expression in very closely related (divergence < 12 000 years), sympatric, but ecologically divergent anadromous and resident populations of brook charr (Salvelinus fontinalis) and their F-1 hybrids. Our results show a dramatic breakdown of gene expression patterns in hybrids compared with their parental relatives. Several disrupted genes are related to energetic metabolism, immune response, osmoregulation and protection against oxidative stress, and none has sex-biased functions. Besides, pure individuals show no expression differences at most of the genes disrupted in hybrids, which may suggest the operation of some form of stabilizing selection. Taken together, these results both confirm the idea that perturbations of regulatory networks represent a significant source of g.i. and support the suggestion that developmental pathways can diverge through time without any manifest change in the phenotypic outcome.

Although the study of networks has become a distinct sub-discipline in pollination biology, few studies have attempted to quantify spatio-temporal variation in species composition and structure of networks. We here investigate patterns of year-to-year change in pollination networks from six different sites spanning a large latitudinal gradient. We quantified level of species persistence and interactions among years, and examined year-to-year variation of network structural parameters in relation to latitude and sampling effort. In addition, we tested for correlations between annual variation in network parameters and short and long-term climate change variables. Numbers of plant and animal species and interactions were roughly constant from one year to another at all sites. However, composition of species and interactions changed from one year to another. Turnover was particularly high for flower visitors and interactions. On the other hand, network structural parameters (connectance, nestedness, modularity and centralization) remained remarkably constant between years, regardless of network size and latitude. Inter-annual variation of network parameters was not related to short or long term variation in climate variables (mean annual temperature and annual precipitation). We thus conclude that pollination networks are highly dynamic and variable in composition of species and interactions among years. However, general patterns of network structure remain constant, indicating that species may be replaced by topologically similar species.

Marine protected areas (MPAs) are expected to function Simultaneously as biological conservation and fisheries management tools, but empirical evidence linking biodiversity conservation with fisheries benefits is scarce. Around the Medes Islands marine reserve (Spain, NW Mediterranean) patterns of fish catch diversity, catch (CPUE) and income (IPUE) were assessed and the economic value of diversity for local fisheries was explored by combining a Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis with geostatistics. 2. Catch data were derived from the trammel net fleet operating around the MPA to gain information on species diversity, functional diversity, functional redundancy, CPUE and IPUE. 3. Results revealed significant impact of both the fishing prohibition in the MPA and the presence of seagrass beds on diversity metrics, catch and income. Clear differences in functional redundancy in fish assemblages were found within the study area, indicating greater resilience of the fish assemblage against fishing pressure or human impact close to the MPA (<= 2 km). In contrast, fish assemblages beyond 2 km of the MPA border are more vulnerable to disturbance. High values of diversity, CPUE and IPUE overlapped close to the MPA border and close to seagrass beds. 4. The spatial approach developed suggests that, in addition to the more commonly studied effect of density-dependent spillover of adult fish, increased levels of ecological diversity and economic diversity can also result in fisheries benefits of an MPA. Hence, the fishing regulations in and around the Medes Islands marine reserve have shown that biological conservation and fisheries benefits can be complementary in the long-term, which should be considered in future policies for MPAs or MPA networks.

Stream ecosystems exhibit a highly consistent dendritic geometry in which linear habitat units intersect to create a hierarchical network of connected branches. 2. Ecological and life history traits of species living in streams, such as the potential for overland movement, may interact with this architecture to shape patterns of occupancy and response to disturbance. Specifically, large-scale habitat alteration that fragments stream networks and reduces connectivity may reduce the probability a stream is occupied by sensitive species, such as stream salamanders. 3. We collected habitat occupancy data on four species of stream salamanders in first-order (i.e. headwater) streams in undeveloped and urbanised regions of the eastern U.S.A. We then used an information-theoretic approach to test alternative models of salamander occupancy based on a priori predictions of the effects of network configuration, region and salamander life history. 4. Across all four species, we found that streams connected to other first-order streams had higher occupancy than those flowing directly into larger streams and rivers. For three of the four species, occupancy was lower in the urbanised region than in the undeveloped region. 5. These results demonstrate that the spatial configuration of stream networks within protected areas affects the occurrences of stream salamander species.

Using modelled projected shifts in the distributions of sub-Saharan Africa's entire breeding avifauna, we show that species turnover across the continent's Important Bird Area (IBA) network is likely to vary regionally and will be substantial at many sites (> 50% at 42% of IBAs by 2085 for priority species). Persistence of suitable climate space across the network as a whole, however, is notably high, with 88-92% of priority species retaining suitable climate space in >= 1 IBA(s) in which they are currently found. Only 7-8 priority species lose climatic representation from the network.

The stability properties of a community depend on its structure, which is the network of direct effects (interactions) among the variables within the community. These direct effects form feedback cycles (loops) that determine community stability. Although feedback cycles have an intuitive interpretation, identifying how they form the feedback properties of a particular community can be intractable. Furthermore, determining the role that any specific direct effect plays in the stability of a system is even more daunting. Such information, however, would identify important direct effects for targeted experimental and management manipulation even in complex communities for which quantitative information is lacking. We therefore provide a method that determines the sensitivity of community stability to model structure, and identifies the relative role of particular direct effects, indirect effects, and feedback cycles in determining stability. Structural sensitivities summarize the degree to which each direct effect contributes to stabilizing feedback or destabilizing feedback or both. Structural sensitivities prove useful in identifying ecologically important feedback cycles within the community structure and for detecting direct effects that have strong, or weak, influences on community stability. The approach may guide the development of management intervention and research design. We demonstrate its value with two theoretical models and two empirical examples of different levels of complexity. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

To address this and related issues, we developed two network (or energy budget) models, Ecopath and Econetwrk, for the Gulf of Maine ecosystem. These models included 31 network nodes or biomass state variables across a broad range of trophic levels, with the present emphasis to particularly elucidate the role of small pelagics. After initial network balancing, various perturbation scenarios were evaluated to explore how potential changes to different fish, fisheries and lower trophic levels can affect model outputs. Categorically across all scenarios and interpretations thereof, there was minimal change at the second trophic levels and most of the rebalancing after a perturbation occur-red via alteration of the diet matrix. Yet the model results from perturbations to a balanced energy budget fall into one of three categories. First, some model results were intuitive and in obvious agreement with established ecological and fishing theory. Second, some model results were counter-intuitive upon initial observation, seemingly contradictory to known ecological and fishing theory; but upon further examination the results were explainable given the constraints of an equilibrium energy budget. Finally, some results were counter-intuitive and difficult to reconcile with theory or further examination of equilibrium constraints. A detailed accounting of biomass flows for example scenarios explores some of the non-intuitive results more rigorously. Collectively these results imply a need to carefully track biomass flows and results of any given perturbation and to critically evaluate the conditions under which a new equilibrium is obtained for these types of models, which has implications for dynamic simulations based off of them. Given these caveats, the role of small pelagics as a prominent component of this ecosystem remains a robust conclusion. We discuss how one might use this approach in the context of further developing an EAF, recognizing that a more holistic, integrated perspective will be required as we continue to evaluate tradeoffs among marine biological communities.

We analyse whether there is a spatial correlation between macrofungi (Basidiomycota) and human population (both in terms of size and rate of change) in Italy's regions. Although current fungal taxonomic richness increases with increasing number of inhabitants (censused in 1986 and 2006 and predicted for 2026) and with their density, these relationships are not significant when controlling for variations in area amongst regions. This result, along with other recent independent studies, suggests that the large-scale spatial correlation of people and species can be often explained by both variables correlating with a third factor such as area, habitat heterogeneity or energy availability. Macrofungal richness significantly increases with percentage of forest cover, but not with percentage of protected area, suggesting that the conservation of Italian fungi needs to be addressed also outside the current network of national and regional nature reserves. The absence of any significant association of the estimate of macrofungal taxa with human population change observed in the last and predicted for the next two decades implies that there is no current clear trend towards a change of the ratio between macrofungal taxa and human presence at this scale of analysis.

Recent research has demonstrated that wildlife-vehicle-collisions (WVC) involving carnivores are modulated by temporal and spatial factors. Thus, we investigated road mortality on a guild of small and medium-sized carnivores in southern Portugal using road-kill data obtained from a systematic 36 months monitoring period along highways (260 km) and national roads (314 km) by addressing the following questions: (a) which species and age class are most vulnerable to WVC? (b) are there temporal and/or spatial patterns in road-kill? and (c) which life-history and/or spatial factors influence the likelihood of collisions? We recorded a total of 806 carnivore casualties, which represented an average of 47 ind./100 km/year. Red fox and stone marten had the highest mortality rates. Our findings highlight three key messages: (1) the majority of road-killed individuals were adults of common species; (2) all carnivores, except genets, were more vulnerable during specific life-history phenological periods: higher casualties were observed when red fox and stone marten were provisioning young, Eurasian badger casualties occurred more frequently during dispersal, and higher Egyptian mongoose mortality occurred during the breeding period; and (3) modeling demonstrated that favorable habitat, curves in the road, and low human disturbance were major contributors to the deadliest road segments. Red fox carcasses were more likely to be found on road sections with passages distant from urban areas. Conversely, stone marten mortalities were found more often on national roads with high of cork oak woodland cover; Egyptian mongoose and genet road-kills were found more often on road segments close to curves. Based on our results, two key mitigation measures should help to reduce WVC in Portugal. The first involves the improvement of existing crossings with buried and small mesh size fence to guide the individuals towards to the passages, in road segments with high traffic volume (>1200 vehicles/night) and located in preferred carnivore habitats. The second mitigation involves cutting or removal of dense vegetation in verges of road segments with curves to aid motorists in seeing animals about to cross. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, few tools are available to model the matrix's influence on the length, relative quality, and redundancy of dispersal routes connecting habitat patches. Many GIS software packages can use land use/land cover maps to identify the route of least resistance between two points-the least-cost path. The limitation of this type of analysis is that only a single path is identified, even though alternative paths with comparable costs might exist. In this paper, we implemented two graph theory methods that extend the least-cost path approach: the Conditional Minimum Transit Cost (CMTC) tool and the Multiple Shortest Paths (MSPs) tool. Both methods enable the visualization of multiple dispersal routes that, together, are assumed to form a corridor. We show that corridors containing alternative dispersal routes emerge when favorable habitat is randomly distributed in space. As clusters of favorable habitat start forming, corridors become less redundant and dispersal bottlenecks become visible. Our approach is illustrated using data from a real landscape in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. We explored the effect of small, localized disturbance on dispersal routes linking conservation units. Simulated habitat destruction caused the appearance of alternative dispersal routes, or caused existing corridors to become narrower. These changes were observed even in the absence of significant differences in the length or cost of least-cost paths.

Application to the Gironde estuarine food web (France),ECOLOGICAL MODELLING,,,,,,,,,,,,"In the context of ecosystem approach to fisheries, it is a critical issue to build management tools able to predict the possible trajectories of ecosystems under various human pressure or environmental variations, but also capable to point out influent and sensitive components. A major drawback of quantitative models is that they require many data to be implemented, which are often not available. Qualitative modelling with loop analysis needs only few data and offers the possibility to predict effect of sustained perturbations on an ecosystem. It considers direct and indirect interactions by inversing its qualitative community matrix. However, depending on the complexity of the studied ecosystem, predictions can be very inaccurate. Different approaches have been proposed to deal with uncertainty on the sign of the effects in loop analysis. However, as well as reducing uncertainty on their signs, we wanted to allow taking into account the strength of interactions. Thus, we developed a semi-quantitative method coupled with a simulation approach that also permits to use conjointly empirical data and expert opinion. The framework was applied to the Gironde estuarine ecosystem for which an Ecopath model has already been constructed. A sensitivity analysis permitted to show up the uncertainty on the results and revealed the gain of precision on the results while using the semi-quantitative method. Moreover, it pointed out that the precision was much better on strong effects, which allows the identification of influent and sensitive components of the ecosystem. Finally, the correlation between the results of the inverse community matrix and those of the mixed trophic impact routine of Ecopath allowed to place our semi-quantitative method as an intermediate step between loop analysis and Ecopath but also as a complementary approach for network analysis.

Along the European coast, the eggs of the cuttlefish Sepia officinalis are characterized by an increasing permeability of the eggshell during development, which leads to selective accumulation of essential and non-essential elements in the embryo. Temperature and pH are two critical factors that affect the metabolism of marine organisms in the coastal shallow waters. In this study, we investigated the effects of pH and temperature through a crossed (3x2; pH 8.1 (pCO(2), 400 ppm), 7.85 (900 ppm) and 7.6 (1400 ppm) at 16 and 19 degrees C, respectively) laboratory experiment. Seawater pH showed a strong effect on the egg weight and non-significant impact on the weight of hatchlings at the end of development implying an egg swelling process and embryo growth disturbances. The lower the seawater pH, the more Ag-110m was accumulated in the tissues of hatchlings. The Cd-109 concentration factor (CF) decreased with decreasing pH and Zn-65 CF reached maximal values pH 7.85, independently of temperature. Our results suggest that pH and temperature affected both the permeability properties of the eggshell and embryonic metabolism.

This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: 'traditional' food webs, mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology.

Residents and users of coastal areas often perceive marine conservation and management as limiting factors to economic development. Under these conditions, the creation of comprehensive systems of marine protected areas (MPAs) can be problematic. We selected a stretch of coast in southern Italy as a representative example of a Mediterranean coastline and nearshore marine ecosystems, featuring a complex matrix of vulnerable habitats in a landscape fragmented by multiple human activities and associated stressors. Through the use of site-selection algorithms, we investigated how human activities constrain MPA planning. Rather than assuming that patches of the same habitat found at different locations are interchangeable, we considered the scenario of a heterogeneous landscape of human impacts creating high variability in habitat quality. Despite widespread human influence, identification of portions of habitats to be protected from direct human disturbance as core no-take areas is still possible using the inclusion of 10 and 30% of low and high priority habitat, respectively, in reserves as a conservation target. Implementation of MPAs with a limited protection scheme that also include several small no-take areas could represent a feasible strategy for the conservation of Mediterranean coastal marine habitats. Moreover, MPAs could be combined with coastal zoning of activities as a means of further controlling effects over broader areas and allowing for recovery of degraded areas. Site-selection algorithms are invaluable tools for conservation planning.

J,"Lewis, OT; Gripenberg, S",,,,"Lewis, Owen T.; Gripenberg, Sofia",,,Insect seed predators and environmental change,JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"1. The seed-to-seedling transition may be a critical stage in determining the dynamics of plant populations. Insects which kill seeds either before or after dispersal can influence the population dynamics of individual plant species, and ultimately, plant diversity and assemblage composition. 2. We discuss the potential for insect seed predators to maintain diversity in plant assemblages and to structure their composition, with a particular focus on diverse tropical forest habitats. We suggest that our ability to understand the functional effects of insect seed predators is hampered by a shortage of unbiased information on (i) their responses to the density of prey seeds at different spatial scales, and (ii) their host plant specificity. 3. Density-dependence and its implications may be best assessed using manipulative field experiments. Such approaches can reveal how insect seed predators respond behaviourally and demographically to the density of individual host species and multiple host species across a range of spatial scales. 5. Host specificity and its implications may be best addressed through quantitative food web approaches previously applied largely to host-parasitoid interactions. Food webs will allow ecologists to assess the likely importance of indirect interactions such as apparent competition and apparent mutualism in structuring plant assemblages, and the functional consequences of adding or removing individual resource or consumer species. 6. Fully quantifying the wider effects of seed predators will require studies that better integrate seed stage-specific demographic information, and which quantify the long-term effects of variations in seed predation rates for plant recruitment. Synthesis and applications. Compared to other functionally important insect groups such as pollinators, seed predators have received relatively little attention in the context of the functioning and sustainability of agro-ecosystems and the consequences of global environmental change for ecological communities. A fuller understanding of the ecology of insect seed predator-plant interactions will be valuable to conservation and management in a range of natural and agricultural systems. For example, seed predator community ecology is relevant to predicting the consequences of deliberately or unintentionally introducing novel resource or consumer species; the process of habitat recovery following local disturbances; and managing the effects of pest or beneficial seed predators in agricultural crops. Furthermore, patterns of insect seed predation on a larger scale are likely to be highly sensitive to global environmental change drivers such as climate change and systematic habitat modification and fragmentation, with implications for the structure and organization of ecological communities more widely.",,,,"Lewis, Owen T/B-9531-2011","Lewis, Owen/0000-0001-7935-6111",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,DEC,2008,45,6,,,,,1593,1599,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2008.01575.x,,,,,,,WOS:000260257800005,,,,,,

Nonetheless, they are also controlled by other physical factors that may prevent them moving to new thermally suitable sites. Using presence-absence records in 655 sites widespread throughout nine French river units, we predicted the potential future distribution of 30 common stream fish species facing temperature warming and change in precipitation regime. We also assessed the potential impacts on fish assemblages' structure and diversity. Only cold-water species, whose diversity is very low in French streams, were predicted to experience a strong reduction in the number of suitable sites. In contrast, most cool-water and warm-water fish species were projected to colonize many newly suitable sites. Considering that cold headwater streams are the most numerous on the Earth's surface, our results suggested that headwater species would undergo a deleterious effect of climate change, whereas downstream species would expand their range by migrating to sites located in intermediate streams or upstream. As a result, local species richness was forecasted to increase greatly and high turnover rates indicated future fundamental changes in assemblages' structure. Changes in assemblage composition were also positively related to the intensity of warming.

We employ distance sampling on 1471 (early spring) and 602 (summer) 500-m transects and measure habitat characteristics within the transects to estimate local densities and population sizes and to test whether the features of the used habitats (as measured in transects where the species was recorded) differed from those available (measured in the whole sample). Topographic and anthropic features are the main determinants of the habitat use of the species, while other descriptors related to vegetation structure and substrate characteristics play a minor role in its habitat preferences. The slope of the terrain is the most important habitat feature constraining the occurrence of the houbara bustard. The proximity of urban areas. the density of paved roads and rural tracks and the extension of agricultural fields also adversely influence its distribution pattern in Fuerteventura. These habitat patterns does not change between summer and early spring considering the whole population of the species (i.e. without considering sexual or age-related differences).

Here, we used a comparative ecological modelling approach and data from two food webs (North-Central Adriatic and South Catalan Sea) and two time periods (mid-late 1970s and 1990s) in the Mediterranean Sea to evaluate how changes in species composition and biomass have affected food-web properties and the extent of ecosystem degradation. We assembled species lists and ecological information for both regions and time periods into stochastic structural and mass-balance food-web models, and compared the outcomes of 22 food-web properties. Our results show strong similarities in structural food-web properties between the North-Central Adriatic and South Catalan Seas indicating similar ecosystem structure and levels of ecological degradation between regions and time periods. In contrast, a comparison with other published marine food webs (Caribbean, Benguela, and US continental shelf) suggested that Mediterranean webs are in an advanced state of ecological degradation. This was reflected by lower trophic height, linkage density, connectance, omnivory, species involved in looping, trophic chain length and fraction of biomass at higher trophic levels, as well as higher generality and fraction of biomass at lower trophic levels. An analysis of robustness to simulated species extinction revealed lower robustness to species removals in Mediterranean webs and corroborated their advanced state of degradation.

Plant-pollinator interactions are crucial for the reproduction of most angiosperms. When faced with perturbations, plant-pollinator networks might be robust mainly due to the presence of highly generalist species. Perturbations can, in turn, affect how pollinators exploit their food sources and therefore their degree of generalization. 2. In particular, generalization of pollinators might vary with forager density. At high densities floral resources available in plant communities would be more rapidly depleted than at low densities. According to optimal foraging theory (OFT), this decrease in resources should lead to an increase in diet breadth. 3. We investigated the impact of pollinator density on diet breadth of Bombus terrestris. We recorded the individual foraging behaviour of bumblebees from eight colonies. They foraged in presence of either one or several conspecifics on experimental plant communities composed of five plant species. Diet breadth was calculated as the number of plant species visited, as well as by the Levins index. We analyzed the effect of forager density on diet breadth at both the individual and the colony levels. 4. We found that forager density affected degree of generalization at individual and colony levels. A more competitive environment increased individual generalization, as predicted by OFT, and decreased the variability in generalization across colonies. Moreover, we found that bumblebee size was positively related to the amplitude of diet breadth change. 5. Synthesis. Our study sheds light on an additional level of complexity of plant-pollinator systems, showing that pollinator diet breadth is a flexible trait which results from behavioural adaptation to resource availability. More generally, changes in foraging insects' diet via competition for resources are likely to ensue from anthropogenic ecosystem disturbance and to impact upon the functioning of plant-pollinator networks.",,,,"Fontaine, Colin/N-6469-2015; Collin, Carine L/A-4338-2009","Fontaine, Colin/0000-0001-5367-5675; Collin, Carine L/0000-0002-7623-6672",,,,,,,,,,,,0022-0477,1365-2745,,,,SEP,2008,96,5,,,,,1002,1010,,10.1111/j.1365-2745.2008.01405.x,,,,,,,WOS:000258379800018,,,,,,

Information on biomass, P/B ratios, catches, food spectrum, consumption and dynamics of commercial and non-commercial populations was obtained and examined using Ecopath with Ecosim software analyses. The biomass of blades of L. trabeculata and M. integrifolia represented the compartments most relevant to the subsystems studied. Within the herbivores, the sea urchin Tetrapigus niger was dominant, followed by the snails Turritella sp. and Tegula sp. The fishes Pinquipes chilensis and Cheilodactylus variegatus were the dominant predators, followed by the asteroids Heliaster helianthus and Meyenaster gelatinosus. The highest system throughput (72,512g wet weight m(-2) year(-1)) was calculated for the subsystem dominated by M. integrifolia. The mean trophic level of the catch ranged from 1.1 (subsystem dominated by L. trabeculata) to 1.3 (subsystem dominated by M. integrifolia) to 3.2 (barren ground subsystem), showing that harvesting in each system was concentrated either on primary producers (blades of kelp species) or top predator fishes. Although the values for the Relative Ascendency (A/C) fluctuated from 36.5 to 45%, suggesting that all the systems were immature, the subsystem dominated by M. integrifolia emerged as the least resistant to external disturbances (e.g. fisheries). This result agreed with the high value of the system recovery time (SRT) for the M. integrifolia subsystem as a response to combined fisheries scenarios. The results obtained using mixed trophic impact (MTI) and Ecosim [increasing the fishing mortality F-i by 4x] showed that in most of the cases the predictions had the same qualitative tendencies. One of the most important results obtained in this study was that exploitation of kelp blades as an alternative strategy to harvesting the whole plants appeared to be ecologically sustainable, since harvesting the blades propagated only small effects on the entire subsystem. The fish P. chilensis may be considered as a top predator species with a strong top-down control since an increase in its fishing mortality in the subsystem dominated by M. integrifolia produced a high SRT value, and the F-MSY was less than the originally entered F-i in Ecopath. Based on the results obtained, it was concluded that the trophic mass balanced models and simulated management scenarios offered good possibilities for the planning of interventions and manipulations or the planning of more sustainable management strategies in highly disturbed natural systems.

The impact of dominant species on community dynamics may depend on the energy base of population size. We report on an unusual, spatially subsidized population of a tropical, stream-dwelling crab that dominates the benthic fauna of a Kenyan stream. Diet and stable isotope analyses indicated that this crab is a true omnivore, with terrestrial subsidies dominating both plant and animal resources. Unusually, the animal prey included almost no aquatic invertebrates. Instead, a single species of ant constituted similar to 35% of the annual diet (stomach contents analysis) and up to 90% of assimilated nitrogen (estimates from stable isotope analysis). Ants may be pivotal to enabling crab dominance, and this crab may be largely disconnected from the local trophic network for its dietary needs. The paucity of other invertebrates in the stream community suggests that this super-dominant crab is a strong interactor that suppresses aquatic invertebrate populations. Common stabilizing attributes of spatially subsidized food webs (e. g., asynchronous prey availability, wide feeding niche, consumer migration) were absent from this system, and although apparently stable, it may be vulnerable to disturbance in the donor habitat.",,,,,"Arnold, Amanda/0000-0002-5252-4143",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,AUG,2008,89,8,,,,,2325,2334,,10.1890/07-0553.1,,,,,,,WOS:000258236400026,18724742,,,,,

Ship-induced waves disturb benthic invertebrate assemblages colonizing littoral zones of lakes and rivers. However, the impact of ship-induced waves on invertebrates has rarely been quantified, and the influencing factors have not been addressed. 2. In an experimental wave tank, five benthic invertebrate species, Bithynia tentaculata, Calopteryx splendens, Dikerogammarus villosus, Gammarus roeseli and Laccophilus hyalinus, were exposed to waves of increasing shear stress (0.43-2.19 N m(-2)). Mean number of detached individuals was recorded for five littoral habitats [coarse woody debris (CWD), reeds, sand, stones and tree roots], representing different levels of structural complexity as quantified by their fractal dimensions (FD). 3. Results showed that detachment of invertebrates was significantly related to shear stress in all habitats except tree roots. Detachments averaged for the five species were significantly lower in habitats with a high degree of structural complexity, decreasing in the habitat sequence: sand, CWD, stones, reeds and tree roots. 4. Consistent with their different morphologies and methods of attachment to substrates, the five species displayed differences in their response to hydraulic stress that were dependent on habitat. 5. The increasing sheltering effect of structural habitat complexity was mirrored by increasing dissipation of the kinetic energy of waves; i.e. the FD of the habitat was positively correlated with shear stress reduction due to the flow resistance of the habitat. 6. Network habitats such as tree roots provided the best sheltering conditions against hydraulic disturbance, because they combined good refuge availability for all studied invertebrate species and maximal dissipation of kinetic wave energy. Consequently, persistent anthropogenic impacts, such as lakeshore modification or long-term exposure to ship-induced waves, which cause disappearance of complex littoral habitats such as tree roots or dense reed belts, will drastically increase the adverse effects of boating and ship traffic on littoral invertebrate assemblages.",,,,"Brauns, Mario/M-7878-2014; Pusch, Martin T/G-6458-2013","Brauns, Mario/0000-0002-5012-9721; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,1365-2427,,,,AUG,2008,53,8,,,,,1567,1578,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2008.01991.x,,,,,,,WOS:000257712600008,,,,,,

Mangroves are very specialized ecosystems found at the interface between land and sea. Litterfall of mangroves supplies the detritus, nutrients and regulates the productivity of adjacent Hooghly-Brahmaputra estuarine complex and act as an important nursery ground for many commercially important shell and fin fishes. Presently the mangrove ecosystem of Sundarban is under serious threat for different anthropogenic activities. Many islands of this ecosystem are either totally reclaimed, or partially reclaimed, but about 30% of the islands are still virgin. Two islands are selected, one is from virgin forest and another is from reclaimed part for comparative study of benthic food webs of these two islands by using network analysis for possible human impacts. Selected island with virgin forest is almost free from human interference however the island with reclaimed forest fully disturbed due to almost all sorts of anthropogenic stresses. The results demonstrate a dramatic difference between these two islands. Virgin ecosystem is dominantly controlled by detritus, supplied from the litterfall of mangroves. Unlike the most benthic system the bottom community of reclaimed island receives a large contribution from the phytoplankton populations. Detritivory and herbivory ratio is markedly varied in these two systems, about 1:12 in virgin ecosystem and almost 1:1 in reclaimed system. The number of pathways of recycle can be identified much higher in undisturbed system in comparison with that of the reclaimed. Finn cycling is also very low in disturbed part. Litterfall comprises only 16% in reclaimed island where as in virgin island it is about 70%. Pathway redundancy is rather high in disturbed system, indicating the surviving system is probably highly resilient to further perturbation, as one might expect for highly impacted system. However, in virgin forest the ascendancy value is much higher than the redundancy, showing the system is healthy and almost free from any anthropogenic stress. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Twenty-three years of research in headwater streams in the Klamath-Siskiyou and North Coast Bioregions of the Pacific Northwest, U.S.A., showed distinct patterns in the distribution of amphibians to variations in water temperature, % fine sediments and the amount of large woody debris (LWD). 3. Here, we review seven studies that demonstrate connections between species presence and abundance and these three in-stream variables. These data were then used to calculate realized niches for three species, the southern torrent salamander, the larval coastal tailed frog and the larval coastal giant salamander, relative to two of these environmental stressors (water temperature and % fine sediments). Moreover, multivariate generalized additive models were used to predict the presence of these three amphibians when these three stressors act in concert. 4. Stream-dwelling amphibians are shown to be extremely sensitive to changes in water temperature, amounts of fine sediment and LWD, and specific thresholds and ranges for a spectrum of animal responses can be used to manage for headwater tributary ecosystem integrity. 5.

We analysed data for the plant species composition in 16,143 quadrats in which 5044 species and subspecies of higher plants were recorded. We built a simple mathematical model that incorporates the effect of habitat diversity on the species-area relationship (SAR). Results Our analysis showed that habitat diversity was correlated with area. However, keeping habitat diversity constant, species richness was related to area; while keeping area constant, species richness was related to habitat diversity. Comparing the SAR of the 237 sites we found that the slope of the species-area curve was related to habitat diversity. Conclusions Discussion of the causes of the SAR has often focused on the primacy of area per se versus habitat heterogeneity, even though the two mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and should be considered jointly. We find that increasing habitat diversity affects the SAR in different ways, but the dominant effect is to increase the slope of the SAR. While a full model fit typically includes a variety of terms involving both area and habitat richness, we find that the effect of habitat diversity can be reduced to a linear perturbation of the slope of the species accumulation curve.",,,,"Kallimanis, Athanasios/H-4618-2013; Halley, John M/AAP-3004-2020","Kallimanis, Athanasios/0000-0001-7103-9971; ",,,,,,,,,,,,1466-822X,1466-8238,,,,JUL,2008,17,4,,,,,532,538,,10.1111/j.1466-8238.2008.00393.x,,,,,,,WOS:000256614700008,,,,,,

Recent widespread observations of net carbon accumulation in field plots have suggested that terrestrial ecosystems may be a carbon sink, possibly resulting from climate change and/or CO2 fertilization. We hypothesize that field plots may inadequately sample inherently rare mortality events, leading to bias when plot level measurements are scaled up to larger domains. In this study, we constructed a simple computer simulation model of forest dynamics to investigate the effects of disturbance patterns on landscape-scale carbon balance estimates. The model was constructed to be a balanced biosphere at the landscape-scale with a uniform spatial pattern of forest growth rates. Disturbance gap-size distributions across the landscape were modelled with a power-law distribution. Small and frequent disturbances result in a well-mixed heterogeneous forest where even small sample plots represented domain-wide behaviour. However, with disturbances dominated by large and rare events, sample plots as large as 50 ha displayed significant bias towards growth. We suggest that the accuracy of domain level estimates of carbon balance from sample plots are highly sensitive to the distribution of disturbance events across the landscape, and to the number, size and distribution of field plots that comprise the estimate. Assumptions that small clusters of field plots may be representative of domain-wide conditions should only be made very cautiously, and warrant further investigation for verification.",,,,"Chambers, Jeffrey Q/J-9021-2014; Thomas, R.

Species composition within the annual networks showed high temporal variation. Temporal dynamics were also evident in the topology of the network, as interactions among plants and pollinators did not remain constant through time. This change involved both the number and the identity of interacting partners. Strikingly, few species and interactions were consistently present in all four annual plant-pollinator networks (53% of the plant species, 21% of the pollinator species and 4.9% of the interactions). The high turnover in species-to-species interactions was mainly the effect of species turnover (c. 70% in pairwise comparisons among years), and less the effect of species flexibility to interact with new partners (c. 30%). We conclude that specialization in plant-pollinator interactions might be highly overestimated when measured over short periods of time. This is because many plant or pollinator species appear as specialists in 1 year, but tend to be generalists or to interact with different partner species when observed in other years. The high temporal plasticity in species composition and interaction identity coupled with the low variation in network structure properties (e.g. degree centralization, connectance, nestedness, average distance and network diameter) imply (i) that tight and specialized coevolution might not be as important as previously suggested and (ii) that plant-pollinator interaction networks might be less prone to detrimental effects of disturbance than previously thought.

It uses inter-confluence stream reaches as an assessment unit, permits the evaluation of stream health across large regions, and yields an overall disturbance index that is a weighted sum of multiple disturbance factors. The robustness of our approach is linked to the scale of disturbances that affect a stream; it will be less robust for identifying less degraded or reference streams with localized human disturbances.

Attempts to restore damaged ecosystems usually emphasize structural aspects of biodiversity, such as species richness and abundance. An alternative is to emphasize functional aspects, such as patterns of interaction between species. Pollination is a ubiquitous interaction between plants and animals. Patterns in plant-pollinator interactions can be analysed with a food web or complex-systems approach and comparing pollination webs between restored and reference sites can be used to test whether ecological restoration has taken place. 2. Using an ecological network approach, we compared plant-pollinator interactions on four pairs of restored and ancient heathlands 11 and 14 years following initiation of restoration management. We used the network data to test whether visitation by pollinators had been restored and we calculated pollinator importance indices for each insect species on the eight sites. Finally, we compared the robustness of the restored and ancient networks to species loss. 3. Plant and pollinator communities were established successfully on the restored sites. There was little evidence of movement of pollinators from ancient sites onto adjacent restored sites, although paired sites correlated in pollinator species richness in both years. There was little insect species overlap within each heathland between 2001 and 2004. 4. A few widespread insect species dominated the communities and were the main pollinators. The most important pollinators were typically honeybees (Apis mellifera), species of bumblebee (Bombus spp.) and one hoverfly species (Episyrphus balteatus). The interaction networks were significantly less complex on restored heathlands, in terms of connectance values, although in 2004 the low values might reflect the negative relationship between connectance and species richness. Finally, there was a trend of restored networks being more susceptible to perturbation than ancient networks, although this needs to be interpreted with caution. 5. Synthesis and applications. Ecological networks provide a powerful tool for assessing the outcome of restoration programmes. Our results indicate that heathland restoration does not have to occur immediately adjacent to ancient heathland for functional pollinator communities to be established. Moreover, in terms of restoring pollinator interactions, heathland managers need only be concerned with the most common insect species. Our focus on pollination demonstrates how a key ecological service can serve as a yardstick for judging restoration success.",,,,"borba, jared/D-6810-2015",,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,JUN,2008,45,3,,,,,742,752,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01390.x,,,,,,,WOS:000255464600002,,,,,,

Food webs constructed for each season and analyzed using common binary matrix measures show that species richness, linkage density, and the number of observed and possible links increased when parasites were included as individual species nodes. With parasite-parasite and predator-parasite links omitted, measures of community complexity, such as connectance (C), generally increased over multiple seasons. However, relative nestedness (n*) decreased when parasites were included, which may be a result of low resolution of basal resources inflating specialist-to-specialist links. Overall, adding parasites resulted in moderate changes in food web measures when compared to those of four other published food webs representing different ecosystems. In addition, including parasites in the food web revealed consistent pathways of energy flow, and the association of parasite life histories along these pathways suggest stable evolutionary groups of interacting species within the community.",,,,"Hernandez, Alexander/E-8705-2010","Hernandez, Alexander/0000-0001-8708-3774",,,,,,,,,,,,0029-8549,,,,,JUN,2008,156,3,,,,,613,624,,10.1007/s00442-008-0999-9,,,,,,,WOS:000255680000013,18305960,,,,,

They are linked with large- scale ungulate ( reindeer, caribou, elk, and musk- ox) herd declines via starvation and reduced calf production rate when the animals are unable to penetrate the resulting subsnowpack ice layer. ROS events also produce considerable perturbation in the mean wintertime soil temperature under the snowpack. ROS is a sporadic but well- known and significant phenomenon that is currently very poorly documented. Characterization of the distribution and occurrence of severe ROS events is based only on anecdotal evidence, indirect observations of carcasses found adjacent to iced snowpacks, and irregular detection by a sparse observational weather network. We have analyzed in detail a particular ROS event that took place on Banks Island in early October 2003 that resulted in the death of 20,000 musk oxen. We make use of multifrequency passive microwave imagery from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager satellite sensor suite in conjunction with a strong- fluctuation- theory ( SFT) emissivity model. We show that a combination of time series analysis and cluster analysis based on microwave spectral gradients and polarization ratios provides a means to detect the stages of the ROS event resulting from the modification of the vertical structure of the snowpack, specifically wetting the snow, the accumulation of liquid water at the base of the snow during the rain event, and the subsequent modification of the snowpack after refreezing. SFT model analysis provides quantitative confirmation of our interpretation of the evolution of the microwave properties of the snowpack as a result of the ROS event. In addition to the grain coarsening owing to destructive metamorphism, we detect the presence of the internal water and ice layers, directly identifying the physical properties producing the hazardous conditions. This analysis offers the potential to characterize both the frequency and global distribution of ROS using multifrequency satellite passive microwave imagery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1397,,,,,MAR 25,2008,44,3,,,,,,,W03425,10.1029/2007WR005929,,,,,,,WOS:000254535200001,,,,,,

Hence, an understanding of the structure and function of estuarine ecosystems is essential for understanding the persistence and stability of these ecosystems and their response to perturbations. This study synthesises available data and knowledge about the Gironde estuary (SW France) in a mass-balanced trophic model to illustrate potential key patterns in the functioning of the estuarine ecosystem and key elements of its stability. In order to evaluate the total direct and indirect impact on the whole community of the 2 main sources of anthropogenic perturbations in the estuarine area, mortalities induced by fishing and the Blayais nuclear power plant were included in the model. The results suggest that in the Gironde, a typical heterotrophic estuary, there is an asymmetrical flow between distinct and complementary energy channels that enhances the stability of the food web. This dynamic process is illustrated by differential trophic flows in the water column according to the seasons. The succession of species in the environment indicates an optimisation of the use of the available carbon resources over a typical year by the estuarine biological communities.

Gelatinous plankters rely on their life cycles and histories to exploit temporarily abundant resources with an undeniable, but often overlooked, impact on marine food webs. Dramatic increases of gelatinous filter-feeders and/or carnivores (both native and nonindigenous species) are frequently observed, and explanations of these blooms alternatively invoke ecosystem variability, climate change, unspecified anthropogenic perturbation or removal of top predators from trophic networks. Gelatinous plankters, however, are not anomalies in plankton dynamics: the recognition of the ecological importance of their pulses, based on their life cycle patterns (often involving benthic stages), is a critical breakthrough to understand the cycling diversity of plankton in space and time. The current study focuses on the many neglected aspects of the ecology and biology of gelatinous zooplankton, describes how life cycle patterns are central in marine ecology, as are the pulses of gelatinous organisms, and highlights how such a dramatic lack of knowledge can affect our understanding of the marine ecosystem as a whole.",,,,"Boero, Ferdinando/B-4494-2008; Piraino, Stefano/J-5234-2012; Gravili, Cinzia/ABB-4127-2020","Piraino, Stefano/0000-0002-8752-9390; Gravili, Cinzia/0000-0001-8412-4390; Boero, Ferdinando/0000-0002-6317-2710",,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,1616-1599,,,,,2008,356,,,,,,299,310,,10.3354/meps07368,,,,,,,WOS:000254963900026,,,,,,

The monitored fish was caught in the study site and surgically implanted with an ultrasonic transmitter. The fish displayed a regular diurnal rhythm during 25 days before leaving the area.

Its home range was at least 5 ha. A decrease of the detection was observed before the departure of the fish. This decrease coincided with the beginning of the reproduction period in New Caledonia and supports the hypothesis of a fish departure for the reproductive event.

These exercises have resulted in recommendations to governments about which areas of land should be set aside as protected areas, and different levels of government have been involved in the process of land acquisition. In some cases, planning exercises have included implementation of new protected areas to complement existing reserve networks. Many of these exercises have applied principles such as complementarity, using heuristic algorithms that are well-described in the literature. These planning exercises may be conducted within politically or ecologically bounded target regions of varying extents. Here, I develop candidate locations for representative reserve areas for disturbance-sensitive mammals across Canada. I use ecologically bounded regions (within the national boundaries of Canada) at three different levels of spatial hierarchy: mammal provinces, ecozones, and ecoregions. I show that the extent of the target region has an effect on the minimum number of protected areas required to achieve representation; a larger region requires fewer protected areas than the sum of the protected areas required to represent its component regions at a lower level of spatial hierarchy. The results illustrate that selection of sites for inclusion in a reserve network is highly scale-dependent, and different spatial extents in the target regions may introduce inefficiencies or redundancies in selecting representative protected areas.",,,,,"Wiersma, Yolanda/0000-0003-4604-9240",,,,,,,,,,,,0921-2973,,,,,DEC,2007,22,10,,,,,1477,1487,,10.1007/s10980-007-9126-2,,,,,,,WOS:000250632100007,,,,,,

This study identifies the threshold distances upon which several cities and roads, located across a large mosaic landscape of ca. 300 km(2) in central Spain, alter the abundance patterns of the native avifauna. Total species richness, total bird abundance, and abundance of different guilds of birds which are potentially sensitive to human disturbances were modelled by means of tree regression analyzes. Nearby cities do not affect the total bird species richness in natural habitats of the study region. Total bird abundance increases near urban areas, mainly through its positive influence on urban-exploiter species. The effect of roads is negative and highly generalized, although threshold distances to roads vary among different groups of species. The bird communities of deciduous woodlands (ash groves, oak patches and poplars) show higher resilience to deletereous influences from nearby cities and roads. It would be desirable not to build new scattered urban developments within the remnant natural areas of this heavily fragmented region, because their existence and connection to the nearby cities by new roads would add 'invisible' negative effects on the native bird fauna (e.g. on some threatened species from open habitats), considering the buffer distances determining most significant impacts (400 m for urban areas, and 300 m for roads).

Methods have been developed to incorporate climate change, population dynamics, and uncertainty in reserve design, but few studies have examined how to account for natural disturbance. Considering natural disturbance in reserve design may be especially important for the world's remaining intact areas, which still experience active natural disturbance regimes. We developed a spatially explicit, dynamic simulation model, CONSERV, which simulates patch dynamics and fire, and used it to evaluate the efficacy of hypothetical reserve networks in northern Canada. We designed six networks based on conventional reserve design methods, with different conservation targets for woodland caribou habitat, high-quality wetlands, vegetation, water bodies, and relative connectedness. We input the six reserve networks into CONSERV and tracked the ability of each to maintain initial conservation targets through time under an active natural disturbance regime. None of the reserve networks maintained all initial targets, and some over-represented certain features, suggesting that both effectiveness and efficiency of reserve design could be improved through use of spatially explicit dynamic simulation during the planning process. Spatial simulation models of landscape dynamics are commonly used in natural resource management, but we provide the first illustration of their potential use for reserve design. Spatial simulation models could be used iteratively to evaluate competing reserve designs and select targets that have a higher likelihood of being maintained through time. Such models could be combined with dynamic planning techniques to develop a general theory for reserve design in an uncertain world.",,,,"Leroux, Shawn/F-9435-2013; Leroux, Shawn/AAY-9390-2020","Leroux, Shawn/0000-0001-9580-0294; Schmiegelow, Fiona/0000-0002-8219-8684",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,OCT,2007,17,7,,,,,1954,1966,,10.1890/06-1115.1,,,,,,,WOS:000250142500009,17974334,,,,,

However, most studies do not replicate networks, and a statistical evaluation of ENA is lacking. The major objectives of this study, therefore, were to evaluate statistically the effectiveness of ENA in detecting differences in food web properties and to compare ENA output with established community level indices. Quantitative trophic networks (n = 12) representing four high salt marsh ponds during three times (corresponding to low stress, high stress, and post-disturbance) were constructed from an extensive field sampling program augmented by literature values. Food webs of salt marsh ponds were used because these systems contain relatively simple food webs, have well defined boundaries, and allow for adequate replication. A null hypothesis was tested to determine how values of 12 indices from ENA output differed among the three stress/ disturbance conditions (Ho: low stress = high stress = post-disturbance). Results of both ANOVA and Friedman's tests indicated most ENA indices were significantly different among the three stress/ disturbance conditions. The amount of covariance among the indices was relatively low (7 of 66 were significant). Results were compared to differences in community indices (richness, evenness, and diversity) among the three stress/disturbance conditions. ENA output identified differences beyond those recognized by the community indices. Overall, networks were unique enough under different environmental conditions to provide statistically significant differences in ENA results.

The question arises as to the extent and significance of these shifting patterns. Using a novel approach to link qualitative mathematical models and field data, namely using the inverse matrix to identify the community matrix, we reconstructed community networks from kelp forests off the Oregon Coast. We simulated all ecologically plausible interactions among community members, selected the models whose outcomes match field observations, and identified highly frequent links to characterize the community network from a particular site. We tested all possible biologically reasonable community networks through qualitative simulations, selected those that matched patterns observed in the field, and further reduced the set of possibilities by retaining those that were stable. We found that a community can be represented by a set of alternative structures, or scenarios. From 11,943,936 simulated models, 0.23% matched the field observations; moreover, only 0.006%, or 748 models, were highly reliable in their predictions and met conditions for stability. Predator-prey interactions as well as non-predatory relationships were consistently found in most of the 748 models. These highly frequent connections were useful to characterize the community network in the study site. We suggest that alternative networks provide the community with a buffer to disturbance, allowing it to continuously reorganize to adapt to a variable environment. This is possible due to the fluctuating capacities of foraging species to consume alternate resources. This suggestion is sustained by our results, which indicate that none of the models that matched field observations were fully connected. This plasticity may contribute to the persistence of these communities. We propose that qualitative simulations represent a powerful technique to raise new hypotheses concerning community dynamics and to reconstruct guidelines that may govern community patterns.

Road networks on islands may break ecosystem integrity through microclimate edge effects, which are known to be associated with disturbances to animal and plant communities. Road edge effects have been scarcely studied on oceanic islands. In this paper we studied road edge effects on microclimate and canopy structure in laurel and pine forests in Tenerife (Canary Islands). We assessed depth of road edge effect for temperature at four vertical layers (soil, litter and air at 5 cm and 1.3 m above ground), light intensity, canopy cover and height, in transects running from narrow (6-7 m width) asphalt roads and dust trails to 100 m to the interior of both forests. We used an ANOVA procedure with Helmert difference contrasts to identify the distances along transects over which edge effects were significant. We detected significant gradients for most parameters but they were consistently narrow both within and between forests. In the laurel forest, we detected highly significant gradients for soil temperature, light, and canopy cover and height in both asphalt and unpaved roads. In the pine forest, we detected a highly significant gradient for soil temperature at asphalt roads, and a significant light gradient for both asphalt and unpaved roads. From the road edge to the forest interior, significant temperature changes persisted for only 3 m, light variation persisted for 6 m, and canopy cover and height changed significantly within the first 10 m. Asphalt roads and dust trails revealed different patterns of variation for temperature between edge and interior. No differences were found between the two types of roads in edge-interior trends for light or canopy structure. The abruptness of microclimate and canopy gradients was slightly higher in the laurel forest than in the pine forest, caused by a higher edge contrast in the former. The depth of the road edge effect found in laurel and pine forests was small, but it could have cumulative effects on forest microclimate and forest associated biota at the island scale. Such changes deserve attention by local road managers for planning and design purposes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

These new patterns are independent from planned conservation strategies and appear to have a substantial impact on landscapes and biodiversity. We used three land-use/land-cover maps (from 1960 to 2000) covering the Italian peninsula to analyze the pattern of land-use/land-cover change. We measured an increase in forests, especially in mountains, an increase in artificial areas, especially in coastal zones, and a decrease in pastures. Intensively cultivated areas showed a limited decrease while extensively cultivated ones showed a marked decrease. In the same period mammal and bird species followed a similar pattern, with forest birds, ungulates and carnivores increasing, and typically Mediterranean species decreasing. We suggest that our results may provide important information, which could be useful for conservation planning in the entire Mediterranean hotspot. We suggest that an increasing conservation effort should be made to protect the Mediterranean-type forests and scrublands, as well as traditional agricultural practices.

The Redlands Shire in the state of Queensland is colloquially referred to as the Koala Coast due to the abundance of its koala populations, but these are under significant threat from urban expansion. While background disturbances from roads and urban development do represent the main threat, other controllable threat variables such as dog ownership have an impact on koala populations. A Bayesian network model has been developed to understand these relationships and threats ( Figure 1). Habitat conditions for koalas are relatively well understood. Preferred areas have specific eucalypt species, high soil fertility, low acidic and well drained soils. Apart from direct degradation of habitat from land clearing, the major disturbance threats to koalas are from diseases, vehicle movement and domestic pests. Studies focussed on the first two threats show that levels of urbanisation are generally a good indicator of koala population disturbance, but very little has been done on domestic animals. Next to cars, domestic dogs are the highest human-induced impact on koala mortality. Our Bayesian model separates the affects of urbanisation and dog presence to consider what management actions could be taken to reduce the threat of dog attacks. [GRAPHICS] Data was available on many of the key variables, however it was not complete. Mapping was available for vegetation and urban settlement patterns. We also obtained data on dog presence for this study for the year 2005, but recent data for the response variable was sparse. Data from koala surveys carried in 1996 to 1999 was available, but it was difficult to relate these variables because of the incongruent time periods between the koala surveys and domestic dog data. Attempts to statistically model this relationship gave very poor correlations. The decision was made to use a Bayesian network model that was initially parameterised from a subjective survey conducted with ecologists and environmental managers. The survey gave an initial network that was then trained from the available data. Outputs from the model show predictions of koala distributions, scenarios on effects of management actions to control dogs, and the uncertainties in predictions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,978-0-9758400-4-7,,,,2007,,,,,,,1370,1375,,,,,,,,,WOS:000290030701061,,,,,,

Floods are major disturbances to stream ecosystems that can kill or displace organisms and modify habitats. Many studies have reported changes in fish assemblages after a single flood, but few studies have evaluated the importance of timing and intensity of floods on long-term fish assemblage dynamics. 2. We used a 10-year dataset to evaluate the effects of floods on fishes in Kings Creek, an intermittent prairie stream in north-eastern, Kansas, U.S.A. Samples were collected seasonally at two perennial headwater sites (1995-2005) and one perennial downstream flowing site (1997-2005) allowing us to evaluate the effects of floods at different locations within a watershed. In addition, four surveys during 2003 and 2004 sampled 3-5 km of stream between the long-term study sites to evaluate the use of intermittent reaches of this stream. 3. Because of higher discharge and bed scouring at the downstream site, we predicted that the fish assemblage would have lowered species richness and abundance following floods. In contrast, we expected increased species richness and abundance at headwater sites because floods increase stream connectivity and create the potential for colonisation from downstream reaches. 4. Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) was used to select among candidate regression models that predicted species richness and abundance based on Julian date, time since floods, season and physical habitat at each site. At the downstream site, AIC weightings suggested Julian date was the best predictor of fish assemblage structure, but no model explained > 16% of the variation in species richness or community structure. Variation explained by Julian date was primarily attributed to a long-term pattern of declining abundance of common species. At the headwater sites, there was not a single candidate model selected to predict total species abundance and assemblage structure. AIC weightings suggested variation in assemblage structure was associated with either Julian date or local habitat characteristics. 5. Fishes rapidly colonised isolated or dry habitats following floods. This was evidenced by the occurrence of fishes in intermittent reaches and the positive association between maximum daily discharge and colonisation events at both headwater sites. 6. Our study suggests floods allow dispersal into intermittent habitats with little or no downstream displacement of fishes. Movement of fishes among habitats during flooding highlights the importance of maintaining connectivity of stream networks of low to medium order prairie streams.",,,,"Gido, Keith/B-5151-2013; Bertrand, Katie/A-5902-2012; Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009; Bouska, Kristen/J-6976-2019","Bertrand, Katie/0000-0001-8453-6758; Bouska, Kristen/0000-0002-4115-2313; Paukert, Craig/0000-0002-9369-8545",,,,,,,,,,,,0046-5070,,,,,NOV,2006,51,11,,,,,2072,2086,,10.1111/j.1365-2427.2006.01640.x,,,,,,,WOS:000241190900008,,,,,,

J,"Lindenmayer, DB; Franklin, JF; Fischer, J",,,,"Lindenmayer, D. B.; Franklin, J. F.; Fischer, J.",,,General management principles and a checklist of strategies to guide forest biodiversity conservation,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many indicators and criteria have been proposed to assess the sustainable management of forests but their scientific validity remains uncertain. Because the effects of forest disturbances (such as logging) are often specific to particular species, sites, landscapes, regions and forest types, management shortcuts such as indicator species, focal species and threshold levels of vegetation cover may be of limited generic value. We propose an alternative approach based on a set of five guiding principles for biodiversity conservation that are broadly applicable to any forested area: (1) the maintenance of connectivity; (2) the maintenance of landscape heterogeneity; (3) the maintenance of stand structural complexity; and (4) the maintenance of aquatic ecosystem integrity; (5) the use of natural disturbance regimes to guide human disturbance regimes. We present a checklist of measures for forest biodiversity conservation that reflects the multi-scaled nature of conservation approaches on forested land. At the regional scale, management should ensure the establishment of large ecological reserves. At the landscape scale, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) protected areas within production forests; (2) buffers for aquatic ecosystems; (3) appropriately designed and located road networks; (4) the careful spatial and temporal arrangement of harvest units; and (5) appropriate fire management practices. At the stand level, off-reserve conservation measures should include: (1) the retention of key elements of stand structural complexity (e.g., large living and dead trees with hollows, understorey thickets, and large fallen logs); (2) long rotation times (coupled with structural retention at harvest); (3) silvicultural systems alternative to traditional high impact ones (e.g., clearcutting in some forest types); and (4) appropriate fire management practices and practices for the management of other kinds of disturbances. Although the general ecological principles and associated checklist are intuitive, data to evaluate the effectiveness of many specific on-the-ground management actions are limited. Considerable effort is needed to adopt adaptive management natural experiments and monitoring to: (1) better identify the impacts of logging operations and other kinds of management activities on biodiversity, and; (2) quantify the effectiveness of impact mitigation strategies; and (3) identify ways to improve management practices.

Fire behavior in riparian zones is complex, but many aquatic and riparian organisms exhibit a suite of adaptations that allow relatively rapid recovery after fire. Unless constrained by other factors, fish tend to rebound relatively quickly, usually within a decade after a wildfire. Additionally, fire and subsequent erosion events contribute wood and coarse sediment that can create and maintain productive aquatic habitats over time. The potential effects of postfire logging in riparian areas depend on the landscape context and disturbance history of a site; however, available evidence suggests two key management implications: (I) fire in riparian areas creates conditions that may not require intervention to sustain the long-term productivity of the aquatic network and (2) protection of burned riparian areas gives priority to what is left rather than what is removed. Research is needed to determine how postfire logging in riparian areas has affected the spread of invasive species and the vulnerability of upland forests to insect and disease outbreaks and how postfire logging will affect the frequency and behavior of future fires. The effectiveness of using postfire logging to restore desired riparian structure and function is therefore unproven, but such projects are gaining interest with the departure of forest conditions from those that existed prior to timber harvest fire suppression, and climate change. In the absence of reliable information about the potential consequence of postfire timber harvest, we conclude that providing postfire riparian zones with the same environmental protections they received before they burned is justified ecologically. Without a commitment to monitor management experiments, the effects of postfire riparian logging will remain unknown and highly contentious.",,,,"Lindenmayer, David B/P-7183-2017","Lindenmayer, David B/0000-0002-4766-4088",,,,,,,,,,,,0888-8892,1523-1739,,,,AUG,2006,20,4,,,,,994,1004,,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00502.x,,,,,,,WOS:000239545500011,16922216,,,,,

J,"Mumby, PJ",,,,"Mumby, PJ",,,The impact of exploiting grazers (scaridae) on the dynamics of Caribbean coral reefs,ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,,,,,,,,,,,,"Coral reefs provide a number of ecosystem services including coastal defense from storms, the generation of building materials, and fisheries. It is increasingly clear that the management of reef resources requires an ecosystem approach in which extractive activities are weighed against the needs of the ecosystem and its functions rather than solely those of the fishery. Here, I use a spatially explicit simulation model of a Caribbean coral reef to examine the ecosystem requirements for grazing which is primarily conducted by parrotfishes (Scaridae). The model allows the impact of fishing grazers to be assessed in the wider context of other ecosystem processes including coral-algal competition, hurricanes, and mass extinction of the herbivorous urchin Diadema antillarum. Using a new analytical model of scarid grazing, it is estimated that parrotfishes can only maintain between 10% and 30% of a structurally complex forereef in a grazed state. Predictions from this grazing model were then incorporated into a broader simulation model of the ecosystem. Simulations predict that scarid grazing is unable to maintain high levels of coral cover (>= 30%) when severe hurricanes occur on a decadal basis, such as occurs in parts of the northern Caribbean. However, reefs can withstand such intense disturbance when grazing is undertaken by both scarids and the urchin Diadema. Scarid grazing is predicted to allow recovery from hurricanes when their incidence falls to 20 years or less (e.g., most of Central and South America). Sensitivity analyses revealed that scarid grazing had the most acute impact on model behavior, and depletion led to the emergence of a stable, algal-dominated community state. Under conditions of heavy grazer depletion, coral cover was predicted to decline rapidly from an initial level of 30% to less than 1% within 40 years, even when hurricane frequency was low at 60 years. Depleted grazers caused a population bottleneck in juvenile corals in which algal overgrowth caused elevated levels of postsettlement mortality and resulted in a bimodal distribution of coral sizes. Several new hypotheses were generated including a region-wide change in the spatial heterogeneity of coral reefs following extinction of Diadema. The management of parrotfishes on Caribbean reefs is usually approached implicitly through no-take marine reserves. The model predicts that depletion of grazers in nonreserve areas can severely limit coral accretion. Other studies have shown that low coral accretion can reduce the structural complexity and therefore quality of the reef habitat for many organisms. A speculative yet rational inference from the model is that failure to manage scarid populations outside reserves will have a profoundly negative impact on the functioning of the reserve system and status of non-reserve reefs.",,,,"Mumby, Peter/F-9914-2010","Mumby, Peter/0000-0002-6297-9053",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,1939-5582,,,,APR,2006,16,2,,,,,747,769,,10.1890/1051-0761(2006)016[0747:TIOEGS]2.0.CO;2,,,,,,,WOS:000237052200027,16711060,,,,,

In arid landscapes, catchments are drained by a channel continuum that represents a potentially important driver of ecological pattern and process in the surrounding terrestrial environment. To better understand the role of drainage networks in arid landscapes, we determined how stream size influences the structure and productivity of riparian vegetation, and the accumulation of organic matter (OM) in soils beneath plants in an upper Sonoran Desert basin. Canopy volume of velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina), as well as overall plant cover, increased along lateral upland-riparian gradients, and among riparian zones adjacent to increasingly larger streams. Foliar delta C-13 signatures for P. velutina suggested that landscape patterns in vegetation structure reflect increases in water availability along this arid stream continuum. Leaf litter and annual grass biomass production both increased with canopy volume, and total aboveground litter production ranged from 137 g m(-2) y(-1) in upland habitat to 446 g m(-2) y(-1) in the riparian zone of the perennial stream. OM accumulation in soils beneath P. velutina increased with canopy volume across a broad range of drainage sizes; however, in the riparian zone of larger streams, flooding further modified patterns of OM storage.

To forecast the effects of a species removal one can use an algorithm that unfolds a complex food web into a topologically simpler scheme, called its dominator tree. This structure is simple, elegant, and highly informative; all the bottlenecks and the effects of species removal are clearly traceable. While food web studies are mostly qualitative, in this paper the use of the dominator tree is extended to weighted food webs, in which link magnitude is specified. These structures were obtained from ecological flow networks. in eight of these food webs, the analysis consisted in removing links that were weaker than a threshold of magnitude and building the dominator tree associated to the remaining structure. By progressively increasing the threshold up to the value that would make the graph disconnected, we had the opportunity to investigate patterns of dominance as a function of link magnitude.

While, formally, the BE ranges from the smallest hut to the largest city, this chapter focuses upon the health effects of urban areas, which increasingly are the preferred human habitat. Urban areas have many attractive and beneficial influences to human well-being. But at the same time, many effects of urban areas are harmful to well-being, and many are not even recognized as such. Most publications about these topics have described the effects of the BE separately, on either ecosystems or on human health. The interconnectivity between these two effects relative to BE is rarely studied. This paper focuses on the mutual influence and interactions between three related aspects of the BE which can impact ecosystems and human health: transportation, land use, and life style. It also explores some of the links between the BE, human health, and human security. Transportation, especially when based on systems of private cars burning fossil fuels, is often the most important cause of air pollution in both developed and developing countries. Air pollution has many adverse health effects, including asthma and cardiovascular disease. Transport systems based largely on the use of private cars are a major contributor to global warming and to ecosystem degradation. This occurs directly, as the operation of vehicles releases greenhouse gases causing global climate change which is associated with altered temperature and rainfall patterns and rising sea levels. Warmer ocean temperatures are projected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. These effects can also harm cold water fisheries, and otherwise degrade aquatic habitats. The heat-retaining nature of road surfaces and many buildings, together with the loss of vegetation, contributes to heat islands sometimes exacerbated by particulate-dense air pollution. Heat islands may create a double burden of pollution as people respond reactively, for example with air conditioning, rather than within urban redesign, such as exchanging black for green surfaces, fewer roads and more rooftop gardens. Transportation is therefore having an impact on ecohealth as well as human health, and these are interconnected. Land use is greatly affected by urban sprawl practices that are responsible for degrading habitats, for altering ecosystem function, and for reducing biodiversity. Sensitive and critical habitats are often fragmented or sacrificed for roads, suburbs and industrial estates. Urban conurbations also pollute reservoirs, ground water, and stream networks with chemicals and pathogens, with numerous adverse health effects. Habitat loss and fragmentation are two of the most direct impacts of development on previously undeveloped land. Habitat fragmentation and an increased proximity of forest, agricultural land and human populations can promote interaction among vectors, pathogens, and hosts, and in some cases lead to increased infectious disease, including Lyme disease. Deforestation continues to increase in many developing countries, in part to supply affluent urban populations. These illustrations demonstrate that not unlike the transportation factor the BE also affects landuse, incurring major impacts on ecosystems and human health. Changes in life style are a direct consequence of the effects of transportation and land use associated with many BEs. High automobile dependency is often characterized by reduced physical activity, and by diminished personal relationships between individuals and groups, a quality known as social capital. A lack of physical activity combined with excessive caloric consumption commonly leads to overweight or obesity, in turn increasing the risk of many diseases, including Type II diabetes, hypertension, asthma, and cancer. The life style of many BEs exerts a toll on quality of life, including by increased noise disturbance, decreased air clarity and reduced contact with varied and stimulating natural ecosystems. Human security is a widely recognized component of human well-being (Millenium Ecosystem Assessment 2003). Though the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of health does not explicitly include security, the WHO conceptualizion of health is much broader than the absence of physical and mental disease (WHO 1948). It follows that if human health is adversely affected by the BE, then human security will also be reduced, though it is acknowledged that many other factors also influence security. Some of the factors which influence non-health aspects of security, such as the level of crime or interpersonal violence, are also likely to be influenced by the BE, including through the quality and level of social capital and psychological health. As well, the health or wellness of a person is likely to influence that person's resilience in the face of threat. In general, healthy people will feel more secure. Finally, the community level of health can influence security, by influencing one's perception of personal disease risk, including in some cases, vector home diseases. In conclusion, adverse effects of the BE, including reduced air and water quality, degraded ecosystems and biodiversity, and the spread and emergence of infectious disease, are relevant to security. The quality of human life and the integrity of ecosystems are affected not only by direct stressors created by the BE which can affect them separately, but also by stressors derived from one or the other, thereby demonstrating the close interconnectedness between the environment and human health. This paper, therefore, highlights the complexity and the interconnections between the BE, ecosystem and human health, and security. In conclusion, there is significant evidence that compact, mixed-use development focused on mass transit can reduce vehicle travel and air pollution from motor vehicles. There is ample evidence that the BE matters to communities- not just for social and economic reasons, but also for environmental reasons of national concern. Issues related to our BE are growing in importance and, if left unaddressed, will make it difficult to meet national and global environmental goals. A richer and more detailed understanding of the BE and sprawl could yield development strategies that address the social, economic, fiscal, political, and environmental impacts of such growth.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1871-4668,,1-4020-3891-7,,,,2006,5,,,,,,111,+,,,,,,,,,WOS:000235869500009,,,,,,

Using multivariate techniques, we examined the structure of a plant-pollinator web comprising both alien and native plants and flower visitors in the temperate forests of north-west Patagonia, Argentina. Our main objective was to assess whether plant species origin (alien or native) influences the composition of flower visitor assemblages. We also examined the influence of other potential confounding intrinsic factors such as flower symmetry and colour, and extrinsic factors such as flowering time, site and habitat disturbance. 2 Flowers of alien and native plant species were visited by a similar number of species and proportion of insects from different orders, but the composition of the assemblages of flower-visiting species differed between alien and native plants. 3 The influence of plant species origin on the composition of flower visitor assemblages persisted after accounting for other significant factors such as flowering time, bearing red corollas, and habitat disturbance. This influence was at least in part determined by the fact that alien flower visitors were more closely associated with alien plants than with native plants. The main native flower visitors were, on average, equally associated with native and alien plant species. 4 In spite of representing a minor fraction of total species richness (3.6% of all species), alien flower visitors accounted for > 20% of all individuals recorded on flowers. Thus, their high abundance could have a significant impact in terms of pollination. 5 The mutualistic web of alien plants and flower-visiting insects is well integrated into the overall community-wide pollination web. However, in addition to their use of the native biota, invasive plants and flower visitors may benefit from differential interactions with their alien partners.

We focus on the seasonal and interannual space-time variability of precipitation in the Great Himalayas by studying two preeminent storm regimes in detail-monsoon onsets and depressions in general, and wintertime Western Disturbances (cold season events). High-resolution simulations of heavy precipitation storms for two monsoon onset conditions (1999 and 2001) and one wintertime storm (2000) are used to illustrate the complex patterns of interaction between the mountains and the atmosphere, and to show how these affect the spatial distribution of precipitation. Along with observations from an existing ground-based network, these simulations provide unique insights into the space-time features of seasonal and interannual variability of precipitation. Our analysis indicates that the trajectory of monsoon storms during onset events exerts a strong control on the precipitation amounts and rainfall penetration into the rain shadow. Spatial variability of subsequent storm tracks in any given year helps explain the interannual variability of monsoon precipitation. Both observational data and our simulations define striking spatial variability in precipitation on upwind and downwind flanks of ridges that project into obliquely impinging storms. Specifically, as southeasterly monsoon winds encounter north-south oriented ridges, forced lifting of moist air enhances precipitation on the upwind flanks, whereas less precipitation occurs on downwind flanks. This variability is observed at spatial scales as short as similar to 10 km-a distance equivalent to the spacing of major ridge crests. Because infrequent, singular storm events appear to control the mass input to glaciers, and may determine the frequency and spatial distribution of landslides, these findings provide physically based insight into decoupling high-frequency (seasonal to interannual time scales) from low-frequency (multidecadal to centennial and longer time scales) signals in the interpretation of climate and erosion records in the Himalayas. Furthermore, this research suggests that integrative studies aimed at unraveling the role of climate in landscape evolution must include consideration of storm frequency and intensity along with spatial variability at scales consistent with regional climate forcing.",,,,"; Barros, Ana/A-3562-2011","Chiao, Sen/0000-0001-7117-1577; Lang, Timothy/0000-0003-1576-572X; Barros, Ana/0000-0003-4606-3106",,,,,,,,,,,,0072-1077,,978-0-8137-2398-3,,,,2006,398,,,,,,17,38,,10.1130/2006.2398(02),,,,,,,WOS:000271216300003,,,,,,

Principles of island biogeography theory have been applied with some success, but they have limitations. The so-called SLOSS (single large or several small reserves) debate hinged on applications of island biogeography theory to protected areas but wets resolved only to the point that parties agreed there might be different approaches in different situations. Although proponents on both sides of the SLOSS debate generally agree that replicating protected areas is desirable, it is difficult to determine how to replicate reserves in terms of number and spatial arrangement. More important, many targets for representation often do not address issues of species persistence. Here, we used a geographic information system in a study of disturbance-sensitive mammals of the Yukon Territory, Canada, to design a protected-areas network that maintains a historical assemblage of species goals for component ecoregions. We simultaneously determined patterns of diversity as Whittaker's beta and compositional turnover and examined how these two measures can give further insights into reserve location and spatial arrangement. Both regional heterogeneity and compositional turnover between nonadjacent sites were significant predictors of the number of protected areas necessary to represent mammals within each ecoregion.

In a temperate forest in northern Europe, we investigated how fruit-eating birds and habitat variation affect the local distribution of these plants and what the consequences are to the species composition of the fruit-bearing plant community. We subdivided the forest into 25x25 quadrates and mapped the distribution of all fleshy-fruited plant species (18 species) expected to have their seeds dispersed by birds. Our specific aims were (i) to test if the distribution of the fleshy-fruited species in the forest was clumped, (ii) nested, and (iii) to describe the set of species as an interacting network. Our results show that bird-dispersed fleshy-fruited species in a temperate forest constitute a set of orchards with a strong spatial structure. The distributions of species were highly correlated and nested. We suggest that factors involved in dispersal and colonization are mainly responsible of a nested structure, where rare species are only found together with more widespread species and species-poor sites only contain widespread species. Besides, the community had small-world topology with high clustering and short path length between species.

An interdisciplinary, map-based process was used to synthesize information, and the fields of regional ecology and ecosystem geography provided the foundation for analysis. Results illustrate that the protected areas share several regional-scale ecosystem components with each other and with surrounding areas, including globally significant populations of large mammals and other wildlife species as well as vegetation communities that experience a full suite of natural disturbances with little human intervention. The valleys of the Tatshenshini, Alsek, and Copper Rivers serve as important links between coastal and interior areas as well as conduits for the movement of biota. However, connectivity is not distributed equally across the region, and the four core national parks have. linkages with adjacent areas that are as strong, and in many cases stronger, than among themselves. The management challenge is not a matter of linking separate protected areas to create networks. Instead, it lies in integrating existing protected areas with each other and with surrounding areas and resisting small changes that have incremental and cumulative impacts. Interagency cooperation is seen as a key component in facilitating this, and some success has been achieved on the scale of single issues and specific resources. The challenge ahead is to build on this success by strengthening existing institutional frameworks and working toward more comprehensive efforts.

The present study examines the effects of landscape structure on the spatial and temporal dynamics of an expanding black cherry Prunus serotina population within a rural landscape in Flanders, Belgium, carrying a dense network of interconnected hedgerows. The study area, 251 ha in size, harboured a total of 2962 P serotina individuals. The population was characterised by a negative exponential age distribution, a high growth rate and an early and continuous reproduction throughout the species' life cycle. The historical rate of spread of the species through the hedgerow network progressively increased with time, especially during the last decade. Spatial point pattern analysis revealed that the individuals had a significantly clustered distribution pattern and were spatially aggregated around seed sources, hedgerow intersections and roosting trees. Logistic regression analysis confirmed the effect of landscape structure on P scrotina occurrence, suggesting directional long distance dispersal by avian dispersal vectors, resulting in a differential seed pressure throughout the hedgerow network due to the preference of dispersing birds for roosting in structurally rich hedgerow with large trees near hedgerow intersections. Hence, the distribution of P serotina in agricultural landscapes was strongly mediated by dispersal processes. Furthermore, decreasing spatial aggregation along the species life cycle, with especially seedlings and saplings being significantly aggregated while adult individuals were mostly distributed at random, and a relative outward shift of seedling recruitment curves with time indicate density dependent mortality, probably caused by intraspecific competition.",,,,"Hermy, Martin/A-3769-2009","Hermy, Martin/0000-0002-5403-0139",,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,,,,,FEB,2005,28,1,,,,,99,109,,10.1111/j.0906-7590.2005.04054.x,,,,,,,WOS:000227143500010,,,,,,

To this end, a network of 53 specialists gleaned information from more than 1300 documents, the majority never cited before in the academic literature. The designation of 699 species as native, vanished, or non-indigenous in France or in one or more of its biogeographical entities during the Holocene period was investigated. Among these 699 species, 585 were found to belong to one or more of these categories. Among the 154 species that fit the definition of non-indigenous, 86 species were new species for France during the Holocene. Fifty-one that were autochthonous vanished from France during this period. Among these 51 species, 10 (two birds and eight mammals) are now globally extinct. During the last I I millennia, the turnover in the French vertebrate fauna yielded a net gain of 35 species. On a taxon-by-taxon basis, there was a gain in the sizes of the ichthyofauna (19 : 27%), the avifauna (10 : 3%) and the herpetofauna (7 : 9%) and a loss in the mammalian fauna (-1 : 1%). Values of a per-century invasion index were less than I between 9200 BC and 1600 AD but increased dramatically after this date. An exponential model fits the trajectory of this index well, reaching the value of 132 invasions per century for the last sub-period, which encompasses 1945-2002. Currently, the local ecological and economic impacts of populations of 116 species (75% of the 154 that satisfied the criteria for non-indigenous) are undocumented, and the non-indigenous populations of 107 vertebrate species (69%) are unmanaged. The delay in assessing the ecological and economical impact of non-indigenous species, which is related to a lack of interest of French academic scientists in the Science and Action programmes, prevents the public from becoming informed and hinders the debates needed to construct a global strategy. For such a strategy to be effective, it will have to be elaborated at a more global scale than in just France - definitely at least in Europe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1387-3547,,,,,JAN,2005,7,1,,,,,99,106,,10.1007/s10530-004-9639-4,,,,,,,WOS:000226929800009,,,,,,

Hydrologic flowpaths along which biogeochemical processing occurs integrate different patches of the stream. Disturbance events (flood and drying) change these patches, alter connectivity, and reinforce spatial heterogeneity. Heterogeneity within patches (surface stream, hyporheic zone, sand bars, and riparian zone) is generated by the interaction of nitrogen (the limiting nutrient) in transport and organisms such as algae and bacteria. These organisms store nitrogen as they grow, alter N forms and concentrations in transport, and in some cases (e.g., denitrification) export it to the atmosphere. Changes in nitrogen in transport can be large, as are community responses to nitrogen availability, thus reinforcing spatial heterogeneity in successional time. Flowpaths connect patches as well and generate changes in recipient patches as a function of nitrogen delivery rate. This is especially evident at patch boundaries. In streams, flow is markedly linear and inexorably downstream in orientation; however, landscapes are drained by coalescing, dendritic networks that intimately connect stream channels with terrestrial flowpaths over and beneath soils.

A third theme is the need to reflect more fully the diversity of human activities and their history and institutions when assessing landscape heterogeneity and ecosystem function.

However, most riparian and fluvial ( streams and rivers) systems have been greatly altered. Degraded ecosystems commonly reflect influences of land-uses ( e. g., mining, logging, road construction, fire suppression, livestock grazing), hydro-developments ( e. g., dams, irrigation, flood control) and other human actions. Some important consequences include: degradation and fragmentation of habitats, changes in riparian plant associations, isolated fish populations, and altered flow and sediment regimes. This synthesis paper evaluates some major environmental factors that can influence the sustainability of riparian corridors and fluvial systems along lowland-arid to mountain gradients within river drainages of eastern Oregon and Washington. Four tributary rivers of the Columbia River, the Grande Ronde and John Day Rivers in northeastern Oregon, and the Yakima and Methow Rivers on the eastside of the Cascade Mountains in Washington, provide perspectives on environmental conditions. Factors evaluated include: a) dominant riparian plant associations and distributions in relation to differences in precipitation and temperature regimes along elevation gradients; b) ecological and physiochemical functions of riparian and fluvial systems along elevation gradients; c) long-term historical and contemporary cumulative impacts of human actions; and d) management provisions that could restore and sustain ecosystem functions. Ecological functions of riparian and fluvial systems are viewed as being closely coupled because of their dependence on hydrological ( surface and sub-surface) and sediment routing regimes. From a river landscape perspective, achieving greater connectivity can be a key objective for analyzing and integrating the management of riparian and fluvial ecosystems. Effective management should include ensuring the delineation of major limiting factors ( e. g., erosion, water shortages and temperatures) and identification of streamside and channel networks that link critical habitats at multiple landscape scales ( e. g., locations and spacing of refuge habitats for fish and wildlife). Management actions should encourage the connectivity of reaches and habitats and maintenance of riparian and fluvial functions so interactions can occur. Efforts should include renewal of natural flood and sediment routing regimes and the reestablishment of habitats adjacent to ecologically intact habitats.",,,,"Ebersole, Joseph L/A-8371-2009",,,,,,,,,,,,,1015-1621,1420-9055,,,,NOV,2004,66,4,,,,,373,387,,10.1007/s00027-004-0720-y,,,,,,,WOS:000224888400005,,,,,,

Early emphases in stream biogeochemistry involved organic carbon dynamics and whole-ecosystem budgets. These approaches were holistic but cumbersome and laborious and ignored several crucial issues, such as variation in organic matter quality. Nutrient-spiraling approaches rectified this shortcoming and provided a flowpath-specific technique for resolving the dynamics of both inorganic and organic materials and for comparing streams of different sizes and flow rates. The ability of nutrient-spiraling approaches to deal with multiple elements and fluctuating flows, including floods, remains elusive, however. There are several opportunities for stream ecology and biogeochemistry to continue cross-fertilization to the benefit of both disciplines. Chief among these is an emphasis on streams as spatially distributed heterogeneous systems, constantly shifting in shape and configuration through time. Hydrologic and material flowpaths integrate this heterogeneity as they alternately converge and diverge and perfuse the channel, hyporheic zone, riparian zone, and floodplain as they transport materials inexorably downstream. Conceptualizing streams as branched structures adds new insights to biogeochemical processing in space and raises several questions about network shape as an independent variable influencing biogeochemical dynamics such as nutrient retention efficiency. Junctions of streams emerge as potentially significant functional units when streams are viewed as networks. Ultimately, stream drainages finely dissect the land and receive water from soils in channelless upland regions which are themselves pervaded by convergent flowpaths, thus blurring the difference between streams and the landscapes they drain. Other lucrative future research opportunities are discussed including a plea for greater use of stoichiometric approaches and a consideration of geometry, disturbance, and legacies at multiple scales of space and time. We predict that future research in biogeochemistry will increasingly seek and find similarities among diverse ecosystem types by focusing on the spatially explicit flowpaths that integrate and connect them.",,,,"Heffernan, James/D-1261-2010; Sponseller, Ryan/ABI-7338-2020","Heffernan, James/0000-0001-7641-9949; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0012-9658,,,,,SEP,2004,85,9,,,,,2369,2379,,10.1890/03-0244,,,,,,,WOS:000224379600004,,,,,,

This being true, reserve networks with many different assemblages would be expected to represent more species than reserve networks including fewer and less different assemblages. This idea was tested using European species atlas distributions of terrestrial vertebrates and plants. It is asked whether: (1) maximizing AD within one group would represent species diversity of this group better than expected by chance; and (2) maximizing AD within one group would represent species diversity of other groups better than expected by chance. Location Europe. Methods Three ordination techniques (non-metric multidimensional scaling, detrended correspondence analysis and correspondence analysis) are used to summarize patterns of compositional turnover within assemblages. p-Median location-allocation models are then calculated from ordination space to measure the degree of expected species representation within the group being sampled as well as the expected representation within other groups. Results are compared with near-optimal solutions obtained with complementarity-based algorithms and to a null model obtained by simulating selection of areas at random. Matrix correlation analysis was also performed to investigate broad patterns of covariation in compositional turnover of assemblages of species belonging to different taxonomic groups and these values were compared with correlation in species richness scores between groups. Results The AD model did not always represent more species of the group being sampled than expected by chance (P < 0.05). Results were independent of the method and taxonomic group considered. Effectiveness of AD within one group to represent species of other groups varied, but in most cases it was worse than using complementarity-based algorithms as a surrogate strategy. Even when correlations indicated high coincidence between assemblages, taxonomic-based surrogates did not always recover more species than expected by chance (P < 0.05). Main conclusions Results are discussed in the light of two possible explanations: (1) the AD model is based on unrealistic assumptions, namely that species have equal probability of having the centre of their distributions anywhere in ordination space and that species display unimodal, symmetrical, bell-shaped response curves to gradients; (2) particular implementation of methods may be inadequate to summarize useful complementarity among assemblages, especially for restricted-range species. We conclude that both arguments are likely to play a role in explaining results, but that opportunities exist to improve performance of existing surrogate strategies.",,,,"Araujo, Miguel Bastos/AAE-7694-2019; Densham, Paul/C-4083-2011; Araujo, Miguel/B-6117-2008","Araujo, Miguel Bastos/0000-0002-5107-7265; Araujo, Miguel/0000-0002-5107-7265",,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,JUL,2004,31,7,,,,,1037,1050,,10.1111/j.1365-2699.2004.01051.x,,,,,,,WOS:000221906700001,,,,,,

In this paper we explore the potential synergetic effects between these factors. We argue that processes at two levels of spatial scale interact: the metapopulation level and the species range level. Current concepts of spatially dynamic metapopulations and species ranges are consistent, and integration improves Our understanding of the interaction of landscape level and geographical range level processes. In landscape zones in which the degree of habitat fragmentation allows persistence, the shifting of ranges is inhibited, but not blocked. In areas where the spatial cohesion of the habitat is below the critical level of metapopulation persistence, the expansion of ranges will be blocked. An increased frequency of large-scale disturbances caused by extreme weather events will cause increasing gaps and an overall contraction of the distribution range, particularly in areas with relatively low levels of spatial cohesion. Taking into account the effects of climate change on metapopulations, habitat distribution and land use changes, future biodiversity research and conservation strategies are facing the challenge to re-orient their focus and scope by integrating spatially and conceptually more dynamic aspects at the landscape level.

Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory. 2. Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term 'interaction strength'. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field. 3. Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits. 4. Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchangeable with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity. 5. Finally, the prime focus on predator-prey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of non-trophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community.

This review focuses on some recent advances in the experimental biology of coral reef ecosystems, and in particular scleractinian corals, at all levels of biological organization. Many of the areas of interest and techniques discussed reflect a progression of technological advances in biology and ecology but have found unique and timely application in the field of experimental coral reef biology. The review, by nature, will not be exhaustive and reflects the authors interests to a large degree. Because of the voluminous literature available, an attempt has been made to capture the essential elements and references for each topic discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Agriculture operates at several spatio-temporal levels from field to landscape, and induces differential response of communities according to their ecological traits. Reactions of several taxa to landscape and agricultural changes was conducted along landscape gradients in northern Brittany (France) gathering 14 sites. Landscapes ranged from fine grained areas, with a large proportion of permanent grasslands, wood and hedgerows, to coarse grained ones dominated by crops. Response of communities were either loss of species along the gradient (as for Diptera Chironomidae and Empididae), replacement (Coleoptera Carabidae) and no change in species composition (small mammals). In this paper, we present why these taxa react in such different ways according to their life history traits, their mobility patterns and to which parameters of landscape structure or agriculture intensification they are sensitive. Density of hedgerow networks, and permeability of individual hedgerows determine the spatial distribution of adults Diptera according to their flying ability. Mean body size of carabid beetles significantly decreases along the gradient of agricultural intensification, small species adapted to disturbance replacing large ones that are characteristic of stable habitats. The same small mammal species are found all along the two gradients, but their relative abundance is linked to the importance of crops versus more stable habitats in the landscape. We concluded that species survival in those fine grained agricultural landscapes depends on processes operating at the site scale and defining habitat quality, and processes operating at the landscape and/or metapopulation scale such as landscape modifications in connectivity and habitat availability.

Two mass-balance models of this shallow water coastal system were constructed, for 1995 and 1996. During this period, there was an observed change in the composition of the submerged vegetation that indicated a significant improvement in the lagoon's ecology. Mass-balance models were built using the Ecopath modelling software in order to explain the energy transfer through the trophic levels (TLs) of the lagoon's ecosystem. Comparative analysis of the two trophic networks allowed a complete description of the lagoon, and gave clear indications regarding the 'eutrophication level' sensu Nixon and the stage of system maturity sensu Odum of the ecosystem for the 2 years. The turnover rate (production/biomass ratio) of pleustophytes was proposed as an indicator of environmental health at the ecosystem level because it allows positioning the submerged vegetation as a whole along an axis of adaptation strategies to natural selection. All the indices of ecosystem maturity and stability examined showed that the lagoon was in a more stable condition in 1996 than in 1995, although the system was still in a condition of stress. The effects of management actions carried out in the system were quantified by estimating the changes in primary production and accumulation of detritus in the system. Management of the lagoon as an extensive aquaculture operation was assessed by analysing the fishery catch, the transfer efficiencies at different trophic levels and the impact of cormorants, and it was found to contribute to system stability.

The demise of tropical rain forests will lead to a large-scale extinction of genetic diversity, particularly of arthropods. Curtailing these trends might be facilitated by (i) reducing rates of habitat loss and degradation, (ii) enhancing systematics and (iii) increasing the flow of primary information on tropical biodiversity. 2. We emphasize the need to examine alternative approaches that could generate a constant stream of data from tropical ecosystems. We argue that data collecting by parataxonomists (local assistants trained by professional biologists) represents one of the most efficient approaches to the study of tropical ecosystems available to date. 3. Parataxonomists can provide high-quality biological specimens and ecological information; statistical power will be high due to large sample sizes of data; database growth will be rapid and results will be published in a timely manner; and there will be collateral education of local people in conservation biology by the parataxonomists themselves. 4. We stress that training local parataxonomists to inventory and monitor biodiversity is a promising and efficient strategy that deserves more attention in conservation biology. In particular, it may be one of the most feasible approaches for the biological monitoring of small and cryptic organisms in species-rich environments, such as invertebrates in tropical rain forests. 5. Synthesis and applications. Permanent botanical plots yield a wealth of data on the organization of tropical forests, and their numbers should be increased to monitor tropical biodiversity. Likewise, augmenting the number of local parataxonomist groups in various tropical countries and networking these contingents to monitor functionally diverse taxa may provide an efficient biological monitoring system in tropical forests.",,,,"Novotny, Vojtech/G-9434-2014; Basset, Yves F/B-6642-2014; Missa, Olivier/G-2687-2012","Novotny, Vojtech/0000-0001-7918-8023; Basset, Yves F/0000-0002-1942-5717; Missa, Olivier/0000-0002-4330-5192; Miller, Scott/0000-0002-4138-1378",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,1365-2664,,,,FEB,2004,41,1,,,,,163,174,,10.1111/j.1365-2664.2004.00878.x,,,,,,,WOS:000188541900015,,,,,,

We examined this issue by analyzing the network structure of food webs for the Northeast US Shelf, a Caribbean reef, and Benguela, off South Africa. The values of connectance (links per species(2)), link density (links per species), mean chain length, and fractions of intermediate, omnivorous, and cannibalistic taxa of these marine webs are somewhat high but still within the ranges observed in other webs. We further compared the marine webs by using the empirically corroborated 'niche model' that accounts for observed variation in diversity (taxon number) and complexity (connectance). Our results substantiate previously reported results for estuarine, fresh-water, and terrestrial datasets, which suggests that food webs from different types of ecosystems with variable diversity and complexity share fundamental structural and ordering characteristics. Analyses of potential secondary extinctions resulting from species loss show that the structural robustness of marine food webs is also consistent with trends from other food webs. As expected, given their relatively high connectance, marine food webs appear fairly robust to loss of most connected taxa as well as random taxa. Still, the short average path length between marine taxa (1.6 links) suggests that effects from perturbations, such as over-fishing, can be transmitted more widely throughout marine ecosystems than previously appreciated.",,,,"Williams, Richard J/B-8344-2011; Dunne, Jennifer A/C-4714-2008; Martinez, Neo/A-5312-2008","Williams, Richard J/0000-0001-8847-3213; Martinez, Neo/0000-0002-1130-5550",,,,,,,,,,,,0171-8630,,,,,,2004,273,,,,,,291,302,,10.3354/meps273291,,,,,,,WOS:000222691100025,,,,,,
J,"Hanski, I; Heino, M",,,,"Hanski, I; Heino, M",,,Metapopulation-level adaptation of insect host plant preference and extinction-colonization dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes,THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Species living in highly fragmented landscapes typically occur as metapopulations with frequent turnover of local populations. The turnover rate depends on population sizes and connectivities, but it may also depend on the phenotypic and genotypic composition of populations. The Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in Finland uses two host plant species, which show variation in their relative abundances at two spatial scales: locally among individual habitat patches and regionally among networks of patches. Female butterflies in turn exhibit spatial variation in genetically determined host plant preference within and among patch networks. Emigration, immigration and establishment of new populations have all been shown to be strongly influenced by the match between the host plant composition of otherwise suitable habitat patches and the host plant preference of migrating butterflies. The evolutionary consequences of such biased migration and colonization with respect to butterfly phenotypes might differ depending on spatial configuration and plant species composition of the patches in heterogeneous patch networks. Using a spatially realistic individual-based model we show that the model-predicted evolution of host plant preference due to biased migration explains a significant amount of the observed variation in host plant use among metapopulations living in dissimilar networks. This example illustrates how the ecological extinction-colonization dynamics may be linked with the evolutionary dynamics of life history traits in metapopulations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

However, communities occupying patchy environments typically exhibit non-random distributions in which local assemblages of species-poor patches are nested subsets of assemblages occupying more species-rich patches. Nestedness of local communities implies interspecific differences in sensitivity to patchiness. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain interspecific variation in responses to patchiness within a community, including differences in (1) colonization ability, (2) extinction proneness, (3) tolerance to disturbance, (4) sociality and (5) level of adaptation to prevailing environmental conditions. We used data on North American mammals to compare the performance of these 'ecological' hypotheses and the 'physical landscape' hypothesis. We then compared the best of these models against models that scaled landscape structure to ecologically relevant attributes of individual species. Location North America. Methods We analysed data on prevalence (i.e. proportion of patches occupied in a network of patches) and occupancy for 137 species of non-volant mammals and twenty networks consisting of four to seventy-five patches. Insular and terrestrial networks exhibited significantly different mean levels of prevalence and occupancy and thus were analysed separately. Indicator variables at ordinal and family levels were included in models to correct for effects caused by phylogeny. Akaike's information criterion was used in conjunction with ordinary least squares and logistic regression to compare hypotheses. Results A patch network's physical structure, indexed using patch area and isolation, received the greatest support among models predicting the prevalence of species on insular networks. Niche breadth (diet and habitat) received the greatest support for predicting prevalence of species occupying terrestrial networks. For both insular and terrestrial systems, physical features (patch area and isolation) received greater support than any of the ecological hypotheses for predicting species occupancy of individual patches. For terrestrial systems, scaling patch area by its suitability to a focal species and by individual area requirements of the species, and scaling patch isolation by species-specific dispersal ability and niche breadth, resulted in models of patch occupancy that were superior to models relying solely on physical landscape features. For all selected models, unexplained levels of variation were high. Main conclusions Stochasticity dominated the systems we studied, indicating that random events are probably quite important in shaping local communities. With respect to deterministic factors, our results suggest that forces affecting species prevalence and occupancy may differ between insular and terrestrial systems. Physical features of insular systems appeared to swamp ecological differences among species in determining prevalence and occupancy, whereas species with broad niches were disproportionately represented in terrestrial networks. We hypothesize that differential extinction over long time periods in highly variable networks has driven nestedness of mammalian communities on islands, whereas differential colonization over shorter time-scales in more homogeneous networks probably governed the local structure of terrestrial communities. Our results also demonstrate that integration of a species' ecological traits with physical features of a patch network is superior to reliance on either factor separately when attempting to predict the species' probability of patch occupancy in terrestrial systems.",,,,"Swihart, Robert K/D-2787-2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-0270,1365-2699,,,,AUG,2003,30,8,,,,,1259,1279,,10.1046/j.1365-2699.2003.00925.x,,,,,,,WOS:000184391000012,,,,,,

Events such as hurricanes, oil spills, disease outbreaks, hypoxic events, harmful algal blooms, and coral bleaching can cause massive mortality and dramatic habitat effects on local or even regional scales. Although designers of marine reserves might assume low risk from such events over the short term, catastrophes are quite probable over the long term and must be considered for successful implementation of reserves. A simple way to increase performance of a reserve network is to incorporate into the reserve design a mechanism for calculating how much additional area would be required to buffer the reserve against effects of catastrophes. In this paper, we develop a method to determine this insurance factor: a multiplier to calculate the additional reserve area necessary to ensure that functional goals of reserves will be met within a given catastrophe regime. We document and analyze the characteristics of two relatively well-studied types of disturbances: oil spills and hurricanes. We examine historical data to characterize catastrophe regimes within. which reserves must function and use these regimes to illustrate the application of the insurance factor. This tool can be applied to any reserve design for which goals are defined by a quantifiable measure, such as a fraction of shoreline, that is necessary to accomplish a particular function.

Second, wood is being placed in locations where channel form and hydraulics favor stability and where wood is-likely to accumulate. Third, there is an increased emphasis on passive recruitment of wood from natural source areas (instead of active placement) where the likelihood that it will enter streams through channel migration, windthrow, and landslides is high. Fourth, restoration targets for wood loads are incorporating landscape-scale objectives; thus, managing wood to emulate the spatial and temporal variability produced by natural disturbances is replacing fixed prescriptions for wood in individual reaches.

Populations of plants and animals need minimum biotopes for their ontogeny; for assuring their survival they depend on a minimum of connected suitable areas. Specific traits of forest types are based upon different disturbance regimes, ranging from small-scale internal processes (e.g. regeneration, growth, senescence, mortality, gap dynamics) generating normal forest cycles (i.e. regular sequences, e.g. regeneration, optimum, decay phases) to potentially chaotic and large-scale, frequently external, disturbances, e.g. fire, landslides, or beetle attacks. Forest protection may meet the needs of these very different demands by varied protected area networks going from small (> 100 ha), medium (1000 ha) to large-scale reserves (National Parks, several thousands of ha). According to this triple protection concept not only graduated threshold numbers, but also threshold sizes and threshold areas for forest protection must be defined.

Learning for life relies on an opening of the vocation of traditional universities and on the creation of a European university. Sharing resources in a competitive environment is one response given by British universities in the framework of a Discipline Network in Coastal Sciences and Management in 1996-2000. Networking is truly the key to a fast evolving teaching and learning context, notably in relation to ever developing information and communication technologies. The dissemination of scientific information is primordial in this context; a case study relating to the European project Marine biodiversity in Europe (BIOMARE) demonstrates the need for an elaborated strategy leading to socio-economic considerations.

A review of literature,REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Waterbird hunting is a widespread human activity over wetlands of the Eurasian continent. It has two components that can influence the population dynamics of migratory species : mortality and disturbance. Disturbance is the focus of an increasing number of detailed studies, using both experimental and theoretical approaches. They are synthesized herein. Disturbance is considered important when induced changes influence the fitness of the individuals of a species (decrease in survival or breeding success). Studies show that disturbance almost always change the geographical distribution of birds, conducting to an under-exploitation of food resources available in hunting areas. Disturbance can also favour an increase in the turnover rate of individuals on their migratory stopover. These changes in bird distribution, although precisely quantified at a local scale, have an unknown impact on the population size of the concerned species. The wide distribution of several of these species ranging over several continents makes the precise evaluation of this impact difficult. Disturbance changes behaviour either by increasing time spent in activities more costly than those done without disturbance or by decreasing time spent gaining energy. Estimation or simulation of these lost can reach 25% of the daily energy expenses. Facing disturbance, birds can develop several physiological adaptations, for instance an increased food intake, an increased efficiency of energy assimilation or an augmentation of corticosterone secretion stimulating food searching. The direct evaluation of the energy balance of these adaptations has not been made yet and it can be acknowledged that they allow birds to maintain energy gains similar to those obtained without disturbance. However, the long-term cost of this compensation is high. A recent study of the Greater Snow Goose Anser caerulescens atlantica on their spring stopover in Canada indicates that hunting disturbance makes geese use lower quality habitats, decreases their body condition (fat and protein) when they depart to the breeding sites and decreases their breeding success relative to individuals that have not experienced hunting. Uncertainties remain, for instance at the species level (few studies on waders), but all authors that emphasized them also agree to acknowledge that protection measures must be taken to counter-balance the effects of hunting disturbance. They recommend the increase of protected areas (hunt-free areas), the elaboration of a network of reserves and the establishment of non hunted zones around existing reserves to reduce to the minimum the negative effects of disturbance on birds that use these reserves. The implementation of these management actions must favour the widening of the distribution of these populations and facilitate the local and regional increase of their numbers. These protection measures are positive responses to the recommendations of the European Union birds and habitats directives.",,,,"Bechet, Arnaud/AAA-4398-2021","Bechet, Arnaud/0000-0002-0330-6342",,,,,,,,,,,,0249-7395,,,,,,2003,58,4,,,,,435,449,,,,,,,,,WOS:000188302900006,,,,,,

If environmental factors generally exhibit high levels of spatial autocorrelation. them may be playing a more important role in synchronizing animal populations than sometimes recognized. Here I examine this issue by analyzing spatial autocorrelation in annual rainfall and mean annual temperatures from sites throughout the world using the database maintained by the Global Historical Climatology Network. Both annual precipitation and mean annual temperatures exhibit high synchrony declining with distance and are statistically significant over large distance, often on a continental scale. In general, synchrony was slightly higher in annual precipitation at short distances, but greater in mean annual temperatures at long distances, No latitudinal gradient in synchrony of either variable was detected, The high overall synchrony observed in these environmental variables combined with a pattern of decline with distance similar to that observed in many animal populations suggest that the Moran effect can potentially play an important role in driving synchrony in a wide variety of ecological phenomena regardless of scale.",,,,"Koenig, Walter D/A-5509-2009","Koenig, Walter/0000-0001-6207-1427",,,,,,,,,,,,0906-7590,,,,,JUN,2002,25,3,,,,,283,288,,10.1034/j.1600-0587.2002.250304.x,,,,,,,WOS:000175943800004,,,,,,
J,"Duarte, CM",,,,"Duarte, CM",,,The future of seagrass meadows,ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION,,,,,,,,,,,,"Seagrasses cover about 0.1-0.2% of the global ocean, and develop highly productive ecosystems which fulfil a key role in the coastal ecosystem. Widespread seagrass loss results from direct human impacts, including mechanical damage (by dredging, fishing, and anchoring), eutrophication, aquaculture, siltation, effects of coastal constructions, and food web alterations; and indirect human impacts, including negative effects of climate change (erosion by rising sea level, increased storms, increased ultraviolet irradiance), as well as from natural causes, such as cyclones and floods. The present review summarizes such threats and trends and considers likely changes to the 2025 time horizon. Present losses are expected to accelerate, particularly in South-east Asia and the Caribbean, as human pressure on the coastal zone grows. Positive human effects include increased legislation to protect seagrass, increased protection of coastal ecosystems, and enhanced efforts to monitor and restore the marine ecosystem. However, these positive effects are unlikely to balance the negative impacts, which are expected to be particularly prominent in developing tropical regions, where the capacity to implement conservation policies is limited. Uncertainties as to the present loss rate, derived from the paucity of coherent monitoring programmes, and the present inability to formulate reliable predictions as to the future rate of loss, represent a major barrier to the formulation of global conservation policies. Three key actions are needed to ensure the effective conservation of seagrass ecosystems: (1) the development of a coherent worldwide monitoring network, (2) the development of quantitative models predicting the responses of seagrasses to disturbance, and (3) the education of the public on the functions of seagrass meadows and the impacts of human activity.",,,,"Duarte, Carlos M/A-7670-2013","Duarte, Carlos M/0000-0002-1213-1361",,,,,,,,,,,,0376-8929,1469-4387,,,,JUN,2002,29,2,,,,,192,206,,10.1017/S0376892902000127,,,,,,,WOS:000178121600005,,,,,,

Also, along each transect temperature co-varies with precipitation and photosynthetically active radiation, which are also variable among the transects.

NA allows one to study the system at different scales: At the level of bilateral interactions, input-output structure matrices are calculated to look at the direct and indirect effects that one flow has on another: at the functional level, the food web is mapped into a concatenated trophic chain, and till simple, directed biogeochemical cycles are identified and separated froth the supporting dissipative flows; and at the system's level global variables describe the state of development of the total network. The systems in question are the Everglades graminoid marsh and the adjacent cypress swamp. The graminoid marsh is essentially a two-dimensional system, with reduced diversity of primary producers. and a more focussed dependency of higher trophic levels on one particular primary producer. the periphyton. Although the cypress swamp system contains most of the same flora and fauna as the graminoids, it extends into a third dimension, and contains additional forms of terrestrial vegetation that increase the diversity of primary production, and thereby the resilience of the ecosystem. The importance of detritus to both systems is marked, although recycling within detritus is far more important in the graminoids than in the cypress. The linkages to higher trophic levels are relatively fewer in the graminoids. and the diversity of interactions between the detritus and higher trophic levels is much higher in the cypress. Overall, the presence of a third dimension imparts diversity and resilience to the cypress system, although the faster turnover rates of the graminoids make them more productive.

The sea star Meyenaster gelatinosus and the crabs Cancer polyodon, C. porteri and Paraxanthus barbiger were found to be the most prominent predators in the benthic system.

The highest total biomass and system throughput (33579.3 t/km(2)/year) was calculated for the sand-gravel habitat. The sand habitat had a negative net system production due to the amount of primary production imported from deeper waters to satisfy the food requirements of the large beach clam (Mulinia sp.) populations. The mean trophic level of the fishery varied between 2.06 (sand-gravel) and 3.92 (sand) reflecting the fact that the fishery concentrates on primary producers (i.e. algae and filter feeding), and on top predators (i.e. snails and crabs). Fishery is strongest in sand-gravel habitat, where annual catches amount to 122.05 g/m(2). Low values of the relative Ascendency (A/C) (from 27.4 to 32.7%) suggest that the systems analysed are immature and highly resistant to external perturbations. Manipulations of the input data for the exploited species suggest that seagrass and sand-gravel habitats have a potential for a similar to 3 times higher than the present production of scallops and the red algae Chondrocanthus chamissoi.

Turnover rate is known to depend on ecological factors, such as population size and connectivity, but it may also be influenced by the phenotypic and genotypic composition of populations. The Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) in Finland uses two host-plant species that vary in their relative abundances among distinct habitat patches (dry meadows) in a large network of 1,700 patches. We found no effect of host species use on local extinction. In contrast, population establishment was strongly influenced by the match between the host species composition of an empty habitat patch and the relative host use by larvae in previous years in the habitat patches that were well connected to the target patch. This colonization effect could be due to spatially variable plant acceptability or resistance or to spatially variable insect oviposition preference or larval performance. We show that spatial variation in adult oviposition preference occurs at the relevant spatial scale and that the other possible causes of the colonization effect can be discounted. We conclude that the colonization effect is generated by host preference influencing the movement patterns of ovipositing females. Migrant females with dissimilar host preferences have different perceptions of relative patch quality, which influences their likelihood of colonizing patches with particular host composition.",,,,"singer, michael c/I-6225-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,,,,,OCT,2001,158,4,,,,,341,353,,10.1086/321985,,,,,,,WOS:000171003600002,18707331,,,,,

However. it has also been suggested that metapopulation theory would not be applicable to species with long generations compared to those with short ones. In this paper, we review how and on what empirical ground metapopulation terminology liar, been applied to insects, small mammals and large mammals, The review showed that the metapopulation term sometimes was used for population networks which only fulfilled the broadest possible definition of a metapopulation, i.e. they were subpopulations connected by migrating individuals. We argue that the metapopulation concept should be reserved for networks that also show some kind of metapopulation dynamics. Otherwise it applies to almost all populations and loses its substance. We found much empirical support for metapopulation dynamics in both insects and small mammals, but not in large mammals. A me possible reason is the methods used to confirm the existence of metapopulation dynamics, For insects and small mammals, the common approach is to study population turnover through patch occupancy data. Such data is difficult to obtain for large mammals, since longer temporal scales need to be covered to record extinctions and colonizations. Still, many populations of large mammals are exposed to habitat fragmentation and the resulting subpopulations sometimes have high risks of extinction. If there is migration between the subpopulations, the metapopulation framework could provide valuable information on their population dynamics. We suggest that a metapopulation approach can be interesting for populations of large mammals. when there are discrete breeding subpopulations and when these subpopulations have different growth rates and demographic fates. Thus, a comparison of the subpopulations' demographic fates, rather than subpopulation turnover, can be a feasible alternative for studies of metapopulation dynamics in large mammals.",,,,"Elmhagen, Bodil/M-4444-2014; Angerbjorn, Anders/A-5982-2013","Elmhagen, Bodil/0000-0001-5496-4727; Angerbjorn, Anders/0000-0001-5535-9086",,,,,,,,,,,,0030-1299,1600-0706,,,,JUL,2001,94,1,,,,,89,100,,10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.11316.x,,,,,,,WOS:000170481600008,,,,,,

The four species showed contrasting spatial distributions despite the fact that they feed on the same host plant. Information on dispersal rates and population turnover suggest that each species is likely to exhibit metapopulation dynamics, but with different relative contributions of local and regional processes. Detailed analyses of habitat requirements suggest that habitat networks were species-specific, and their degree of occupancy a function of the number of patches in the system. These results do not support the idea that patchiness promotes regional coexistence through multispecies metapopulation dynamics.

Despite apparently little change in the natural disturbance regime, there is increasing concern that forest management activities related mainly to timber harvest and to the extensive network of roads constructed to support timber harvest, fire control, and recreation since the late 1800s have altered disturbance regimes and landscape structure. We investigated the magnitude of change in landscape structure resulting from roads and logging since the onset of timber harvest activities in 1950. We found limited evidence for significant impacts in our study area when all lands within the landscape were considered. The relatively minor changes we observed reflected the vast buffering capacity of the large proportion of lands managed for purposes other than timber (e.g., wilderness). Significant changes in landscape structure and fragmentation of mature forest were, however, evident on lands designated as suitable timberlands. Roughly half of the mature coniferous forest was converted to young stands; mean patch size and core area declined by 40% and 25%, respectively, and contrast-weighted edge density increased 2- to 3-fold. Overall, roads had a greater impact on landscape structure than logging in our study area. Indeed, the 3-fold increase in road density between 1950-1993 accounted for most of the changes in landscape configuration associated with mean patch size, edge density, and core area. The extent of area evaluated and the period over which change was evaluated had a large impact on the magnitude of change detected and our conclusions regarding the ecological significance of those changes. Specifically, the cumulative impact on landscape structure was negligible over a 10-year period, but was notable over a 40-year period. In addition, the magnitude of change in landscape structure between 1950-1993 varied as a function of landscape extent. At the scale of the 228 000 ha landscape, change in landscape structure was trivial, suggesting that the landscape was capable of fully incorporating the disturbances with minimal impact. However, at intermediate scales of 1000-10 000 ha landscapes, change in landscape structure was quite evident, suggesting that there may be an optimal range of scales for detecting changes in landscape structure within the study area.",,,,"Romme, William H./C-7317-2016",,,,,,,,,,,,,0921-2973,,,,,MAY,2001,16,4,,,,,327,349,,10.1023/A:1011185409347,,,,,,,WOS:000169516300004,,,,,,

The relationships between species assemblages and 20 environmental variables were investigated; including climate, topography, vegetation, landscape attributes, and land-use. Detrended correspondence analysis, canonical correspondence analysis, and hierarchical classification suggested that the major gradients of bird species variation are primarily related to climatic variables such as growing season temperature and seasonality of precipitation, reflecting the strong;east-west gradient in oceanicity in KwaZulu-Natal, and water balance, reflecting a strong north-south gradient in aridity. Hierarchical classification was applied to the ordination data and revealed five representative types of bird communities. Four of the five bird communities and 37 species are under-represented in the existing reserve system, and the environmental processes required for long-term maintenance of birds have not been adequately sampled, showing that additional reserves are needed to ensure a more functional representative system.

We sought to demonstrate that this situation occurs for Reed Warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) in a riverine, mainly agricultural landscape in the Netherlands. We collected data on occurrence and habitat features in a large number of mostly small marshlands. We used a stochastic model to simulate the population dynamics in a metapopulation with sinks and sources. A statistical analysis of the field data, using regression techniques with occupation probability and abundance index as dependent variables, showed that habitat quality was less favourable in small habitat patches (e.g., ditches with reeds) than in larger patches (large, heterogeneous marshlands). The spatial cohesion of the landscape also played an important role: abundance of breeding Reed Warblers in regions with low spatial cohesion was low. Local extinctions and recolonizations occurred and their rates depended on the spatial parameters of the patch. This supports the hypothesis that metapopulation theory is applicable here. The results of the modeling study demonstrated that, besides the trivial dependence of sinks on sources, a larger amount of sink area and increased exchange of individuals increased the stability of source patches. This was shown not only by the larger size of the source population but also by increased resilience after a catastrophe. The area of the sink seemed less important than its distance to the source. The simulation indicated an optimal area of a few hectares (compared to a 10-ha area of the source) and a maximum distance of 2-5 km from the source. In creating sustainable landscapes, for example, by setting up an ecological network consisting of a limited number of high-quality patches, these small and seemingly insignificant habitat patches could play an important role and should be taken into consideration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0888-8892,1523-1739,,,,DEC,2000,14,6,,,,,1881,1892,,10.1111/j.1523-1739.2000.99022.x,,,,,,,WOS:000166035800037,,,,,,

Although we think that the establishment of any conservation policies along the vast coastline of Chile must be based on a multitude of approaches and considerations, scientific, biological, and ecological principles should guide much of these efforts. In this paper, we attempt to present a general overview of the current knowledge about the ecology and biogeography of nearshore systems in Chile. Based on the most relevant existing information, our goals are to: 1) Identify major biogeographic and ecological features of nearshore ecosystems, and the obvious gaps in information, 2) identify the most harmful human activities impacting the structure and dynamics of these systems, and 3) suggest the possible use of indicators to assess the conservational status of different environments along the coast. This overview shows, on one side, the geographic areas of deficitary knowledge on nearshore environments that are critical for future marine conservation and management plans, and on the other, the availability of high quality information for other geographic areas along the coast. Regarding the taxonomy and large-scale patterns of species distribution, important gaps in information were detected, however no big changes in the total number of species are expected in the future. There are few large-scale patterns of species distribution are reported in the literature, and in this contribution, but more work needs to be done, particularly for some taxa, to identify areas of high species diversity as well as areas which possess unique characteristics in terms of ecosystem processes (e.g., particular disturbance and upwelling regimes in coastal marine ecosystems) and species (e.g., endemic and keystone species). For most marine invertebrates and macroalgae, hotspots in species diversity are present in southern Chile. New studies addressing the causal factors generating these large-scale patterns of species distribution are also needed; information about coastal oceanography and larval supply is still poor. This information crucial for the design of a marine reserve network. The information available on community structure and ecosystem functioning, especially highlighting the effect of human impact, comes from very few geographic regions. More information about community structure for other areas of the coast is required, particularly considering the strong differences in temperature, circulation patterns, habitat heterogeneity, species composition, as well as of upwelling and El Nino effects along the 4,000 km of coastline.

It analyzes the role of EME in coastal management and conservation. The historical development of strategies for managing single or multispecies fisheries are reviewed. The published results show overexploitation and depletion of more than 60% of the fish stocks and a lack of connection between the management of fisheries and results derived from experimental marine ecology. This is mainly due to: (a) the different temporal and spatial scale at which most marine ecologists and fishery managers operate; (b) the lack of long-term fishery monitoring and adaptive techniques for management; and (c) limitations in the design of experiments on fisheries. Large-scale oceanic perturbations, due to combinations of excessive resource exploitation and environmental variability coupled with present trends in management approaches are discussed. Modern approaches and tools for management of fisheries, such as Adaptive Management (AM), Territorial User Rights in Fisheries (TURFs), Individual Transferrable Quotas and Non-Transferrable Quotas (ITQs, INTQs) are discussed in the context of small-scale fisheries and EME, Published views on limits of applied ecological research with regards to management of fisheries are discussed. Linkages between EME, marine conservation and the establishment of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) and experimental exclusions of humans are highlighted. Results derived from MPAs, such as: (a) species or community trophic cascades, and (b) the role of key-stone species and species interaction strengths, are discussed. It is concluded that the role of EME in conservation has been greater than has been the case in management of fisheries. The potential to link EME, conservation and the management of fisheries is exemplified through the proposed establishment in Chile of a connected network of Scientific Reserves, MPAs and TURFs sites. The final conclusion is that to cross-fertilize EME, conservation and management, there are three main challenges: (1) to end the traditional view of approaching the management of fisheries and marine conservation as contradictory/antagonizing issues; (2) to improve communications between experimental marine ecology and the management of fisheries through the implementation of experimentation and adaptive management; (3) to improve linkages between marine conservation, the management of fisheries and social sciences.

Within this context, we propose the use of a graph-theoretic index (i.e., the Harary index) as a measure of landscape connectivity. Results derived from the analysis of the vegetation map of Palmarola (central Italy) show that, from a statistical and ecological viewpoint, the Harary index may be a better measure of landscape connectivity than more traditional indices derived from transportation geography.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1585-8553,1588-2756,,,,JUN,2000,1,1,,,,,89,94,,10.1556/ComEc.1.2000.1.12,,,,,,,WOS:000558874600012,,,,,,

Thus, land use and land management increasingly represent a fundamental source of change in the global environment. Despite their global importance, however, many decisions about the management and use of land are made with scant attention to ecological impacts. Thus, ecologists' knowledge of the functioning of Earth's ecosystems is needed to broaden the scientific basis of decisions on land use and management. In response to this need, the Ecological Society of America established a committee to examine the ways that land-use decisions are made and the ways that ecologists could help inform those decisions. This paper reports the scientific findings of that committee. Five principles of ecological science have particular implications for land use and can assure that fundamental processes of Earth's ecosystems are sustained. These ecological principles deal with time, species, place, disturbance, and the landscape. The recognition that ecological processes occur within a temporal setting and change over time is fundamental to analyzing the effects of land use. In addition, individual species and networks of interacting species have strong and far-reaching effects on ecological processes. Furthermore, each sire or region has a unique set of organisms and abiotic conditions influencing and constraining ecological processes. Disturbances are important and ubiquitous ecological events whose effects may strongly influence population, community, and ecosystem dynamics. Finally, the size, shape, and spatial relationships of habitat patches on the landscape affect the structure and function of ecosystems. The responses of the land to changes in use and management by people depend on expressions of these fundamental principles in nature. These principles dictate several guidelines for land use. The guidelines give practical rules of thumb for incorporating ecological principles into land-use decision making. These guidelines suggest that land managers should: (1) examine impacts of local decisions in a regional context, (2) plan for long-term change and unexpected events, (3) preserve rare landscape elements and associated species, (4) avoid land uses that deplete natural resources, (5) retain large contiguous or connected areas that contain critical habitats, (6) minimize the introduction and spread of nonnative species, (7) avoid or compensate for the effects of development on ecological processes, and (8) implement land-use and management practices that are compatible with the natural potential of the area. Decision makers and citizens are encouraged to consider these guidelines and to include ecological perspectives in choices on how land is used and managed. The guidelines suggest actions required to develop the science needed by land managers.",,,,"Hobbs, Tom/C-5263-2016; Dale, Virginia H/B-6023-2009; Naiman, Robert J/K-3113-2012; Dale, Virginia H/ABI-6672-2020; Turner, Monica G/B-2099-2010; Huntly, Nancy/A-9329-2010","Dale, Virginia H/0000-0002-4123-7202; Valone, Thomas/0000-0002-7657-3126; Travis, William/0000-0002-9197-1317; Huntly, Nancy/0000-0001-6051-6365",,,,,,,,,,,,1051-0761,,,,,JUN,2000,10,3,,,,,639,670,,,,,,,,,WOS:000087506600001,,,,,,

It is therefore an ideal model species for studying the colonization history of central European freshwater systems, in particular with respect to the possible influences of the Pleistocene glaciation cycles. We sampled Cottus populations across most of its distribution range, with a special emphasis on southern Germany where the major European drainage systems are in closest contact. Mitochondrial d-loop sequencing of more than 400 specimens and phylogenetic network analysis allowed us to draw a detailed picture of the colonization of Europe by C. gobio. Moreover, the molecular distances between the haplotypes enabled us to infer an approximate time frame for the origin of the various populations. The founder population of C. gobio stems apparently from the Paratethys and invaded Europe in the Pliocene. From there, the first colonization into central Europe occurred via the ancient lower Danube, with a separate colonization of the eastern European territories. During the late Pliocene, one of the central European populations must have reached the North Sea in a second step after which it then started to colonize the Atlantic drainages via coastal lines. Accordingly, we found very distinct populations in the upper and lower Rhine, which can be explained by the fact that the lower Rhine was disconnected from the upper Rhine until approximate to 1 million years ago (Ma). More closely related, but still distinct, populations were found in the Elbe, the Main and the upper Danube, all presumably of Pleistocene origin. Intriguingly, they have largely maintained their population identity, despite the strong disturbance caused by the glaciation cycles in these areas. On the other hand, a mixing of populations during postglacial recolonization could be detected in the lower Rhine and its tributaries. However, the general pattern that emerges from our analysis suggests that the glaciation cycles did not have a major impact on the general population structure of C. gobio in central Europe.",,,,"Tautz, Diethard/D-4304-2011; Nolte, Arne/I-4661-2017; Tautz, Diethard/H-8436-2014","Tautz, Diethard/0000-0002-0460-5344",,,,,,,,,,,,0962-1083,,,,,JUN,2000,9,6,,,,,709,722,,10.1046/j.1365-294x.2000.00912.x,,,,,,,WOS:000087845300007,10849287,,,,,

At the landscape scale, certain definable geometric interactions involving peak flows (floods) and debris flows (rapid movements of soil, sediment, and large wood down steep stream channels) are influences by the arrangement of the road network relative to the stream network. Although disturbance patches are created by peak-flow and debris-flow disturbances in mountain landscapes without roads, roads can alter the landscape distributions of the starting and stopping points of debris flows, and they can alter the balance between the intensity of flood peaks and the stream network's resistance to change. We examined this conceptual model of interactions between road networks and stream networks based on observations from a number of studies in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregan (U.S.A.). Road networks appear to affect floods and debris flows and thus modify disturbance patch dynamics in stream and riparian networks in mountain landscapes. We speculate that these changes may influence the rates and patterns of survival and recovery of disturbed patches in stream networks, affecting ecosystem resilience, and we outline an approach for detecting such effects based on a patch dynamics perspective. A field sampling scheme for detecting the magnitude of various road effects on stream and riparian ecology could involve (1) landscape stratification of inherent stream network susceptibility to floods or debris flows, (2) overlay of road and stream networks and creation of areas with various densities of road-stream crossings, and (3) designations of expected high- and low-impact stream segments based on numbers of upstream road-stream crossings where sampling of selected biological variables would be conducted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0888-8892,1523-1739,,,,FEB,2000,14,1,,,,,76,85,,10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99083.x,,,,,,,WOS:000085366700012,,,,,,

Here, we use data from the Common Birds Census in Britain as an exemplar data set to determine guidelines for the selection of reserve networks which are more robust to temporal turnover in features. The extinction patterns found over the 1981-1991 interval suggest that two such guidelines are to represent species in the best sites where they occur (higher local abundance) and to give priority to the rarer species. We tested five reserve selection strategies, one which finds the minimum representation set and others which incorporate the first or both guidelines proposed. Strategies were tested in terms of their efficiency (inversely related to the total area selected) and effectiveness (inversely related to the percentage of species lost) using data on eight pairs of ten-year intervals. The minimum set strategy was always the most efficient, but suffered higher species loss than the others, suggesting that there is a trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness.

J,"Barnes, RFW",,,,"Barnes, RFW",,,Is there a future for elephants in West Africa?,MAMMAL REVIEW,,,,,,,,,,,,"The elephants of West Africa have experienced a long history of human disturbance. Before 1800 they were much affected by the precolonial empires of the savanna and Sahelian zones, the trans-Saharan trade routes, and the coastal trade established by the Europeans. During the 19th century, the increasing demand for ivory from Europe and North America, the European penetration of the region, and the evolution of breech-loading rifles devastated the remaining elephants. The elephant population of West Africa collapsed before the outbreak of World War I because of intense hunting for ivory. This collapse pre-empted the decline that would have occurred anyway due to the rapid growth of the human population and consequent loss of habitat. Elephants now find themselves in about 70 small isolated populations that cover only 5% of the region. These fragments are very vulnerable - whether in the acid lands or the humid forests - to poaching and general human disturbance. There are few data on numbers; most of the population estimates are guesses. Two-thirds of the populations are thought to consist of fewer than 200 animals and therefore have a low probability of surviving the next century. As more habitat is lost to human activities, West African elephants will soon remain only in protected areas. But many parks and reserves are managed poorly and cannot offer effective protection; they do not guarantee a future for elephants. In addition, their crop-raiding habit makes elephants unpopular in rural communities surrounding protected areas. Human populations are expected to continue growing and resources for conservation are scarce. The future of West African elephants lies in a small network of well-protected areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0305-1838,,,,,SEP,1999,29,3,,,,,175,199,,10.1046/j.1365-2907.1999.00044.x,,,,,,,WOS:000082778700002,,,,,,

Analyses of gene flow or genetic distances failed to reveal a significant relationship with geographical distance, probably because of the complexity of environmental heterogeneity. However, matrix comparisons between genetic distances and connectivity networks among adjacent colonies (Gabriel-connected graph) yielded a significant correlation in every case, indicating a 'step-by-step' relationship between neighbouring localities. Moreover, most of the allozymes were spatially structured and showed (i) a gradual isolation of colonies with increasing geographical distances, and (ii), for some correlogram profiles, a circular gradient illustrating a multidirectional colonization of the village.

In the arid Negev Desert highlands of southern Israel, porcupines excavate and consume subterranean organs of 18 species of geophytes and hemicryptophytes in a variety of habitats. Their foraging generates a network of direct and indirect impacts on ecological processes. Porcupine digs varied in size according to depth of forage and substrate, and new digs averaged about 8 cm in depth, and 400 cm(2) and 940 cm(3) in surface area and volume, respectively. Digging rates also differed among habitats. In hilly watersheds, highest digging rates were in soil belts supporting the greatest cover of shrubs and geophytes. Dig densities peaked at > 1 dig m(-2), impacting up to 4% of soil surfaces. Digs are temporary soil pockets (longevities of < 2 to > 10 years) that trap soil, water, organic matter, and seeds. As highly productive microhabitats compared to surrounding soil matrix, they promote the germination and growth of annual plants including some porcupine forage species. Loose soil excavated by porcupines enhances soil erosion and transport, and may substantially enhance ecosystem flows of water, soil, and nutrients. Porcupine digging may help to maintain bare rock outcrops in Negev watersheds, thereby promoting large runoff flows that produce mesic patches and plant habitats. Runoff dynamics have greatly influenced past and present human exploitation of Negev landscapes. Recent experiments indicate that porcupine digs have important properties as small-scale landscape disturbances, and as sources and sinks of critical environmental resources. Additional research is needed to better define and predict porcupine digging impacts at several ecological levels, and as a basis for realistic management of Negev habitats and landscapes.

We analyze the possible causes of this decline using a;spatially realistic metapopulation model, the incidence function model. The pika metapopulation is the best-known mammalian example of a classical metapopulation with significant population turnover, and it satisfies closely the assumptions of the incidence function model, which was parameterized with data on patch occupancy. The model-predicted incidences of patch occupancy are consistent with observed incidences, and the model predicts well the observed turnover rate between four metapopulation censuses. According to model predictions, the part of the metapopulation where the decline has been observed is relatively unstable and prone to large oscillations in patch occupancy, whereas the other part of the metapopulation is predicted to be persistent. These results demonstrate how extinction-colonization dynamics may produce spatially correlated patterns of patch occupancy without any spatially correlated processes in local dynamics or extinction rate. The unstable part of the metapopulation gives an empirical example of multiple quasi equilibria in metapopulation dynamics.

In the absence of complete species inventories, however, area selection must employ surrogate data such as the distribution of plant or vertebrate species. The degree to which the use of these taxa results in a network of sites with maximum complementarity for others depends on levels of assemblage fidelity among taxa. Assemblage fidelity is defined here as the degree to which assemblages from different phylogenic groups co-occur in space and time. We examined the spatial fidelity of ground-active invertebrate (ants and several beetle families: Carabidae, Scarabaeidae, Pselaphidae), vascular plant, and vertebrate assemblages (birds, small mammals, frogs, and reptiles) at 56 sites in a range of eastern Australian forest types. We used unlogged (n = 32) and logged (n = 24) forest sites. Assemblage fidelity was assessed by ordination and Mantel correlation, and patterns of species richness and species turnover that helped explain the findings were analyzed by simple correlation, cluster analysis, and two indices of beta diversity. Our analyses revealed general assemblage fidelity among plant, vertebrate, and invertebrate assemblages, and results were consistent in both unlogged and logged forest. In several forest types, however, fidelity among invertebrates and plants was low due to high invertebrate turnover. Overall levels of species turnover were much higher for vascular plants and invertebrates than for vertebrates. Species richness patterns at individual sites were generally uncorrelated among taxa. Our findings suggest that (1) the exclusion of invertebrates from biodiversity surveys cannot be justified on the assumption that plant and vertebrate assemblages act as surrogates for invertebrate species-level biodiversity or on the basis of cost-efficiency; (2) both spatial fidelity and species turnover are useful for evaluating the role of selected taxa as surrogates for the species-level biodiversity of others; (3) the selection of sites for in situ biodiversity conservation should consider taxa that exhibit high levels of species turnover; and (4) the inclusion of invertebrates in biodiversity surveys may offer considerable cost savings and be more representative of species biodiversity than conventional plant and vertebrate surveys.",,,,"York, Alan/M-2443-2015","York, Alan/0000-0003-3161-4075",,,,,,,,,,,,0888-8892,,,,,AUG,1998,12,4,,,,,822,835,,10.1046/j.1523-1739.1998.97075.x,,,,,,,WOS:000075179800015,,,,,,

Levels and annual patterns of stream NO3- concentrations and intra-annual seasonal patterns characteristic of latter phases of stages 1 and 2 of watershed N saturation were found for low-elevation and high-elevation clear-cut watersheds, respectively, and were related to the dynamics of microbial transformations of N and vegetation uptake.

Detection distances were correlated with visibility but were substantially longer than the average distances at which most animals were disturbed. Most deer were detected without causing prior disturbance. 5. Densities were estimated with a coefficient of variation ranging from 10.2-28.4%. Precision depended on sampling effort and sample sizes obtained. 6. A Monte Carlo simulation revealed a quadratic relationship between accuracy and visibility, with accuracy increasing with average visibility and a tendency for deer to select more open habitats within a forest. Under conditions that are likely to be typical of temperate forests (<40% thicket and neutral selection, or <70% thicket if thicket is avoided), accuracy was generally good and changed relatively little in relation to visibility and habitat selection. 7. Likely sources of bias as well as alternatives to thermal imaging are discussed. It is concluded that the method would be suitable for estimating ungulate densities in forests with an adequate network of tracks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,,,,,OCT,1997,34,5,,,,,1273,1286,,10.2307/2405237,,,,,,,WOS:A1997YD84700013,,,,,,

Nature conservation practice in Central Europe has long been defensive, focusing on the protection of nature in reserves, on the one hand, and on the preservation of particular species, on the other. However, about two-thirds of plant and animal species in Central Europe belong to agro-ecosystems and are hence dependent on human land-uses. Biodiversity strategies have thus to be incorporated into agro-ecosystem development considerations. Results from a test study are presented to show how quantitative targets for nature conservation planning, in a fine-grained landscape of individual farming, can be developed for this purpose. Documentation on large vertebrates in Europe clearly demonstrates that there is a connection with the coarse-grained agronomy structures of the former Eastern Bloc countries, where these large vertebrates are still abundant, whereas these latter are rare, endangered or already extinct in European Union (EU) countries. There is some evidence that, on the large contiguous tracts of agricultural lands of the former Eastern Bloc countries, there is only sporadic disturbance owing to farming activities (pulse disturbance) whereas, in most of the EU 'amenity' small-scale landscapes, activities on the land create a pressing disturbance for wildlife. Thus, large-scale farming is essential for the maintenance of the more conspicuous large vertebrates. This approach towards nature conservation may be described as site-oriented land-use separation. In this respect, the 'new' Europe offers a tremendous opportunity for research networks, within which the different structures of agro-ecosystems may be compared with each other (e.g. Poland, with its agro-industrial, private and mixed systems, or South Moravia, with intensity rings around villages, or even on a continental scale). There is a pressing need for this type of comparative research for new nature conservation strategies, to steer fundamental changes in agricultural landscapes by the new Community Agricultural Policies.",,,,,"Pauleit, Stephan/0000-0002-0056-6720",,,,,,,,,,,,0169-2046,,,,,JUN,1997,37,1-2,,,,,73,84,,10.1016/S0169-2046(96)00371-4,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XJ29700009,,,,,,
J,"Phillips, OL",,,,"Phillips, OL",,,The changing ecology of tropical forests,BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION,,,,,,,,,,,,"The threat to tropical forests is often gauged in terms of deforestation rates and the total area remaining. Recently, however, there has been a growing realization that forest can appear intact on a satellite image yet be biologically degraded or vulnerable to degradation. The array of direct threats to humid tropical forest biodiversity, in addition to deforestation, includes: selective extraction of plants; selective extraction of animals, biological invasion; fragmentation; climate change; changing atmospheric composition; and increasing tree turnover rates. The threats are linked to one another by a poorly understood network of causality and feedback effects. Moreover, their potential impacts on forest biodiversity are hard to assess because each threat is as likely to precipitate indirect effects as direct effects, and because several threats are likely to interact synergistically with one another. In spite of the uncertainties, it is clear that the biological health of tropical forests can become seriously degraded as a result of these threats, and it is unlikely that any tropical forest will escape significant ecological changes. Some groups of plants and animals are likely to benefit at the expense of others. Species diversity is expected to decline as a consequence of the changes in forest ecology. In the 21st century scientists and conservationists will be increasingly challenged to monitor, understand, prevent and head off these threats.",,,,"Phillips, Oliver L/A-1523-2011","Phillips, Oliver L/0000-0002-8993-6168",,,,,,,,,,,,0960-3115,,,,,FEB,1997,6,2,,,,,291,311,,10.1023/A:1018352405482,,,,,,,WOS:A1997WP89200008,,,,,,

In this paper we use statistical relationships derived from European long-term experiments to explore the potential for carbon sequestration in soils in the European Union. We examine five scenarios, namely (a) the amendment of arable soils with animal manure, (b) the amendment of arable soils with sewage sludge, (c) the incorporation of cereal straw into the soils in which it was grown, (d) the afforestation of surplus arable land through natural woodland regeneration, and (e) extensification of agriculture through ley-arable farming. Our calculations suggest only limited potential to increase soil carbon stocks over the next century by addition of animal manure, sewage sludge or straw (< 15 Tg C y(-1)), but greater potential through extensification of agriculture (approximate to 40 Tg C y(-1)) or through the afforestation of surplus arable land (approximate to 50 Tg C y(-1)). We estimate that extensification could increase the total soil carbon stock of the European Union by 17%. Afforestation of 30% of present arable land would increase soil carbon stocks by about 8% over a century and would substitute up to 30 Tg C y(-1) of fossil fuel carbon if the wood were used as biofuel. However, even the afforestation scenario, with the greatest potential for carbon mitigation, can sequester only 0.8% of annual global anthropogenic CO2-carbon. Our figures suggest that, although efforts in temperate agriculture can contribute to global carbon mitigation, the potential is small compared to that available through reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions by halting tropical and sub-tropical deforestation or by reducing fossil fuel burning.",,,,"Smith, Jo U/F-7763-2012; Smith, Pete/G-1041-2010; Glendining, Margaret/I-1942-2019","Smith, Jo U/0000-0001-6984-6766; Smith, Pete/0000-0002-3784-1124; Glendining, Margaret/0000-0002-6466-4629",,,,,,,,,,,,1354-1013,,,,,FEB,1997,3,1,,,,,67,79,,10.1046/j.1365-2486.1997.00055.x,,,,,,,WOS:A1997WG66100008,,,,,,

Based on studies of effects of hunting disturbance on local waterbird distribution and abundance, freedom from such disturbance is concluded to be an important part of waterbird management on nature conservation areas. Measures to mitigate the effects of disturbance from hunting are reviewed. These include complete removal of hunting in refuges, as well as spatial and temporal regulation of hunting activity in reserve areas outwith hunting-free refuges. 2. Disturbance-free refuge design should take account of the ecological requirements of all species using a site and the functional units required to meet all daily activities, especially primary feeding and roosting areas used by waterbirds. Refuge size and shape must ensure birds are free from the effects of external disturbance. The most effective are of regular shape, maximum practicable size, and as a minimum should have a diameter of three times the escape flight distance of the most sensitive species present. 3. Zoning in non-refuge areas can increase local bird numbers by restricting disturbance to regular predictable stimuli to which habituation is more likely. Mobile hunting activity close to roosting and/or feeding areas is more disturbing than hunting from fixed points or where birds are shot moving between such areas. Intermittent hunting is not an effective means of minimizing disturbance, but where implemented rest periods between hunting events should be considered in weeks rather than days. 4. Most studies of mitigation techniques to minimize hunting disturbance have been descriptive and retrospective. Manipulative studies testing specific hypotheses are essential to create a sound scientific base for management. 5. Management of hunting activity should take place within a broader management planning framework that identifies ideal and operational objectives in the management of the site, including feedback monitoring to determine the effectiveness of management prescriptions. 6. We recommend that local site management planning should be integrated internationally, especially in the planning of refuge networks along migration corridors. Management actions in one part of a flyway may affect the ability of areas elsewhere to meet obligations to biodiversity conservation and maintenance of range under international law. In populations that are limited by winter resources, creation of a refuge network may offer a mechanism to enhance population size, but more large scale density dependence studies are required to confirm this.",,,,"Madsen, Jesper/J-7853-2013; Fox, Anthony D/I-7465-2013","Madsen, Jesper/0000-0003-3246-0215; ",,,,,,,,,,,,0021-8901,,,,,FEB,1997,34,1,,,,,1,13,,10.2307/2404842,,,,,,,WOS:A1997WX89800001,,,,,,

The colony is a scene for both cooperation and conflicts, and the conceptual framework for the evolution of social life and colony organization is provided by the kin selection theory. Variable molecular markers make it possible to dissect kinship within colonies, identifying patrilines and matrilines and estimating genetic relatednesses. Such markers have been used to test hypotheses on social conflicts between queens and workers (split sex ratio hypothesis), among workers (worker policing hypothesis), and among reproductive females (skew hypothesis). The data from several species of ants, bees, and wasps indicate that workers can obtain information on the genetic heterogeneity of their colonies and use that information to manipulate reproductive decisions. The social structure of colonies and the mode of colony founding affect the population-wide dispersal of sexuals. Populations with multi-queen colonial networks have limited dispersal; females stay in their natal colonies, and mating flights can be restricted. As a result, coexisting queens tend to be related to each other, maintaining the genetic integrity of colonies, and populations become spatially differentiated to an extent that can lead even to socially driven speciation.",,,,"Pamilo, Pekka/C-6907-2011; Seppa, Perttu/A-9900-2011","Seppa, Perttu/0000-0001-5393-6943",,,,,,,,,,,,0066-4162,,,,,,1997,28,,,,,,1,25,,10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.28.1.1,,,,,,,WOS:000070961400001,,,,,,

During this period, data were collected regularly on breeding success and nest site use and availability. Feeding habitat use and prey availability have also been assessed during a series of breeding seasons. We review some of the information collected during these long-term studies, and we appraise how this information contributes to understanding population regulation, assessing vulnerability factors, and setting conservation priorities. A minimum of 25 years of population monitoring appears to be necessary to witness 1 or more episodes of climate perturbations and to begin evaluating their effects on a population, though some questions e.g., those relating to breeding biology, may be answered during shorter periods. The appropriate spatial scale also depends on the question asked. The Camargue forms an ideal spatial unit for the study of breeding biology and population dynamics, i.e., a group of colonies that constitutes a discrete, relatively isolated population. The size of the latter allows assessment of numbers of breeding and wintering birds, of climatic conditions, of reproductive success, mortality and dispersal rates based on sightings of marked birds. However, for migrant species an assessment of the conditions in overwintering areas also is necessary. Conservation efforts have focused so far mainly on colony site protection. In Italy, this has led to the establishment of a network of nature reserves for colonially breeding Ardeidae. These measures have been successful, but a number of vulnerability factors exist which are more difficult to deal with. The largest heron population in northwest Italy depends for its food on ricefields and is therefore vulnerable to changing practices in rice cultivation. According to recent analyses environmental contaminant concentrations are not considered at present a serious problem in Italy. In the Camargue, management of freshwater marshes for hunting purposes and harvesting of reed (Phragmites australis) also destroy many of the Purple Heron's potential nesting sites.",,,,,"FASOLA, MAURO/0000-0002-7366-5893",,,,,,,,,,,,0738-6028,,,,,,1997,20,2,,,,,298,305,,10.2307/1521697,,,,,,,WOS:A1997XR83700015,,,,,,

We studied the variation in bird abundance in 13 small remnants (range 0.03-6.71 ha) of shrubland isolated in farmland by distances of 70-600 m from the nearest native vegetation, a road verge. Overall, 31 species were recorded in the remnants and nearby road verges, and species richness varied from 7 to 15 at individual sites. Regression analysis showed that the structural attributes of verges and the number of birds found in verges were more often significant predictors of variation in the number of individuals of the most common 19 species censused in remnants than were the structural attributes in the remnants themselves. The diversity of all bird species and the richness of species dependent on native vegetation decreased significantly with the distance of remnants from road verges. For a group of 10 species of small passerines, species richness, species turnover, and variation in the number of individuals between consecutive censuses all were negatively related to the distance between remnants and road verges. For five of these 10 species, there were fewer individuals in remnants than in adjacent road verges when the distance between them exceeded 110 m. However, for less-isolated remnants (less than or equal to 110 m), only one species showed a significant difference in abundance. It is concluded that these small shrubland remnants are primarily used by birds moving to and from adjacent areas of native vegetation, in this case road verges. The value of small remnants of vegetation as parts of the conservation network decreases with their isolation, and is strongly linked to the use of road verges by the shrubland bird community.",,,,"Fortin, Daniel/ABG-3554-2020",,,,,,,,,,,,,1035-3712,,,,,,1997,24,6,,,,,679,689,,10.1071/WR96081,,,,,,,WOS:000071013100004,,,,,,
J,"Chapin, FS; Torn, MS; Tateno, M",,,,"Chapin, FS; Torn, MS; Tateno, M",,,Principles of ecosystem sustainability,AMERICAN NATURALIST,,,,,,,,,,,,"Many natural ecosystems are self-sustaining, maintaining a characteristic mosaic of vegetation types for hundreds to thousands of years. In this article we present a new framework for defining the conditions that sustain natural ecosystems and apply these principles to sustainability of managed ecosystems. A sustainable ecosystem is one that, over the normal cycle of disturbance events, maintains its characteristic diversity of major functional groups, productivity, and rates of biogeochemical cycling. These traits are determined by a set of four ''interactive controls'' (climate, soil resource supply, major functional groups of organisms, and disturbance regime) that both govern and respond to ecosystem processes. Ecosystems cannot be sustained unless the interactive controls oscillate within stable bounds, This occurs when negative feedbacks constrain changes in these controls. For example, negative feedbacks associated with food availability and predation often constrain changes in the population size of a species. Linkages among ecosystems in a landscape can contribute to sustainability by creating or extending the feedback network beyond a single patch. The sustainability of managed systems can be increased by maintaining interactive controls so that they form negative feedbacks within ecosystems and by using laws and regulations to create negative feedbacks between ecosystems and human activities, such as between ocean ecosystems and marine fisheries. Degraded ecosystems can be restored through practices that enhance positive feedbacks to bring the ecosystem to a state where the interactive controls are commensurate with desired ecosystem characteristics. The possible combinations of interactive controls that govern ecosystem traits are limited by the environment, constraining the extent to which ecosystems can be managed sustainably for human purposes.",,,,"Chapin, F Stuart/AAZ-3931-2020; Torn, Margaret S/D-2305-2015","Chapin, F Stuart/0000-0002-2558-9910; Torn, Margaret S/0000-0002-8174-0099",,,,,,,,,,,,0003-0147,1537-5323,,,,DEC,1996,148,6,,,,,1016,1037,,10.1086/285969,,,,,,,WOS:A1996VV53400004,,,,,,

Assemblages of epilithic diatoms, macrophytes, benthic macroinvertebrates and fish were monitored over a 5-year period (1988-92) in ten lakes and nine streams in the U.K., as part of the U.K. Acid Waters Monitoring Network. All organisms were categorized according to their functional or morphological characteristics and integrated to describe the food web at each site. In general, the flora and fauna of all sites were typical of oligotrophic, softwater systems subject to various degrees of acidification. 2. Salmonids were the only fish caught at any site and brown trout were the dominant species. With only 5 years of data it was not possible to test for directional changes in fish populations at each site. Among sites, fish density was positively associated with pH, and this did not vary between lake outflows and streams or between fish of different age class (0 +, greater than or equal to 1 +). Condition factor, reflecting fish health, was not associated with pH among sites, but was negatively associated with fish density and, on average, was higher for fish in streams than those in lake outflows. 3. Variability in the diatom, macrophyte and invertebrate data sets were quantified in three ways using multivariate techniques: species turnover or replacement (temporal variation due to directional change), persistence (the reciprocal of between-year variability) and within-year variability (heterogeneity between sample replicates). For all groups, turnover was relatively low and persistence was high. The least persistent macrophyte assemblages occurred in stream sites and this may reflect high inter-annual variation in the cover of filamentous algae which are prone to scouring. Within-year variability was higher than turnover or between-year variability for the diatoms and invertebrates, and highest values were recorded for lake invertebrates. 4. Redundancy analysis, RDA was used to test the diatom, macrophyte, invertebrate and food web data for evidence of directional changes over time and its significance was assessed using Monte Carlo permutation tests. These tests appeared robust to temporal and spatial variability in the data set. Significant trends could be identified in some data sets despite considerable between-replicate and non-linear between-year variability. 5. Significant linear trends in at least one biological group were found at eight lake and seven stream sites. Only one lake and one stream had significant trends in all four groups. These trends represent changes in the flora and/or fauna, but they can be interpreted in several different ways. Only six sites showed trends that were consistent with our knowledge of species' responses to water chemistry: three indicated increased acidity and three indicated decreased acidity. At only one site were the biological results consistent with observed chemical changes and there was disagreement at the other five.

Water transfer to reservoirs reduces stream flow downstream of the extraction point, and surface flows may disappear in affected reaches during the dry season. The ecological effects of periodic dewatering on aquatic insects were investigated in Tai Po Kau Forest Stream, Hong Kong, where water extraction at a weir gives rise to intermittent flow immediately downstream of a well studied perennial stream section. Benthic samples were taken from the intermittent reach on 48 occasions over a two year period encompassing two dry seasons. Trends in total population densities were unclear, with considerable fluctuations over the study period. In contrast, species richness declined markedly after surface flow disappeared. reaching the lowest values at the end of both dry seasons. A rapid increase accompanied flow resumption on the onset of the summer monsoon, and maximum wet season values were up to five times greater than species richness during the dry season. Dry season declines in Ephemeroptera and Trichoptera were accompanied by a dramatic increase in Coleoptera (Elmidae and especially Helodidae). The situation was reversed during the wet season when Trichoptera (especially Cheumatopsyche and Chimarra) and Ephemeroptera (Leptophlebiidae, Baetidae and Heptageniidae) were numerous. Community structure in the intermittent reach recovered quickly from the dewatering disturbance. due largely to recolonization by drifting animals. At the scale investigated, the community was resilient to disturbance because a source of mobile colonists was available upstream. However, if dewatering affects reaches far downstream, the presence of suitable colonists in upstream reaches cannot be guaranteed, and recovery from disturbance will be delayed. Lowland streams in Hong Kong are often polluted and host to exotic species: in such circumstances the effects of water transfers are exacerbated and recolonization is hindered.",,,,"Dudgeon, David/A-2733-2010",,,,,,,,,,,,,0886-9375,,,,,DEC,1992,7,4,,,,,369,377,,10.1002/rrr.3450070407,,,,,,,WOS:A1992KC99700006,,,,,,
