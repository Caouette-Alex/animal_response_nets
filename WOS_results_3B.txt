Iss. SI	1338-1346	1338	1346	English						In the western Mediterranean region of Catalonia (NE Spain), during the last 20 years of the 20th century, the range of many forest bird species has expanded. Our objective was to characterize the roles of (a) spatial population processes (related to dispersal), (b) changes in forest structure (due to forest maturation and management), and (c) landscape composition (resulting from afforestation and fires) in the range expansion of these bird species at the landscape scale (10 x 10 km). After correcting for the differences in sampling effort, colonizations appeared to be more likely near areas in which the species had been present in the 1980s. Patterns of the range expansion were also strongly associated with forest maturation, which seems to affect the spatial arrangement of birds at multiple scales. Changes in forest landscape composition due to afforestation and fires were minor determinants of range changes, and forest management did not seem to prevent range expansion at the spatial scale studied. Colonization events appeared to be driven primarily by landscape changes occurring in nearby localities rather than within the colonized locations themselves, presumably because of source-sink dynamics and connectivity patterns. Our results showed that in Catalonia, at a landscape scale, the impact of forest management on forest bird communities is much smaller than the impact of the widespread maturation of forests following a large-scale decline in traditional uses.

Thus, it would be expected that the extinction of local populations and the attendant loss of immigrants to surrounding populations would reduce synchrony. We tested this hypothesis through a large-scale experiment, simulation of the experimental system and general models. Experimental removal of two adjacent subpopulations of the Rocky Mountain Apollo butterfly, Parnassius smintheus within a network consisting of 15 other local populations resulted in a decrease in immigration to surrounding populations that was proportional to their connectivity to the removal populations. These populations also showed a significant increase in synchrony during population removal. The spatial extent of the synchrony showed good agreement with the predicted loss of immigrants owing to the removals. Simulation of the Parnassius system showed a similar short-term result and also indicated that permanent loss of populations produces structural changes increasing synchrony. General models indicate that an increase in synchrony following extinction occurs when populations undergoing extinction have different carrying capacities than surrounding populations. The result is not owing to biased migration per se, but rather is because of the number of immigrants relative to the carrying capacity. Synchrony following extinction should be most common for patchy populations, but can occur in any situation where carrying capacities differ. Overall, our results indicate that local extinction can create a positive feedback for extinction risk, increasing the probability of extinction for population networks by synchronizing their dynamics.

Proceedings of the Royal Society Biological Sciences Series B		2010	FEB 22 2010	277	1681	625-632	625	632	English						Response delays to predator attack may be adaptive, suggesting that latency to respond does not always reflect predator detection time, but can be a decision based on starvation-predation risk trade-offs. In birds, some anti-predator behaviours have been shown to be correlated with personality traits such as activity level and exploration. Here, we tested for a correlation between exploration behaviour and response latency time to a simulated fish predator attack in a fish species, juvenile convict cichlids (Amatitlania nigrofasciata). Individual focal fish were subjected to a standardized attack by a robotic fish predator while foraging, and separately given two repeated trials of exploration of a novel environment. We found a strong positive correlation between exploration and time taken to respond to the predator model. Fish that were fast to explore the novel environment were slower to respond to the predator. Our study therefore provides some of the first experimental evidence for a link between exploration behaviour and predator-escape behaviour. We suggest that different behavioural types may differ in how they partition their attention between foraging and anti-predator vigilance.

The ontogeny of these social traits is poorly understood. We examined whether increasing exposure to more complex social environments could hone competitive skills and ultimately increase reproductive success in adult brown-headed cowbirds, Molothrus ater. We created two types of flocks ('Dynamic' and 'Stable') that differed in social complexity. In Dynamic flocks, birds were regularly exchanged across groups, whereas in 'Stable' flocks, the composition of birds remained static throughout a year. Social networking analyses revealed that males in the Dynamic flocks had larger and more variable singing networks during the manipulations than did the males in the Stable flocks. When we put males from the two conditions together into new environments with unfamiliar females, the Dynamic-condition males had greater mating success. Our results establish a link between social competence and reproductive success and suggest that social skills are extremely flexible characteristics, even in adulthood.

Conservation Biology		2010	FEB 2010	24	1	171-181	171	181	English						Security infrastructure along international boundaries threatens to degrade connectivity for wildlife. To explore potential effects of a fence under construction along the U.S.-Mexico border on wildlife, we assessed movement behavior of two species with different life histories whose regional persistence may depend on transboundary movements. We used radiotelemetry to assess how vegetation and landscape structure affect flight and natal dispersal behaviors of Ferruginous Pygmy-Owls (Glaucidium brasilianum), and satellite telemetry, gene-flow estimates, and least-cost path models to assess movement behavior and interpopulation connectivity of desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis mexicana). Flight height of Pygmy-Owls averaged only 1.4 m (SE 0.1) above ground, and only 23% of flights exceeded 4 m. Juvenile Pygmy-Owls dispersed at slower speeds, changed direction more, and had lower colonization success in landscapes with larger vegetation openings or higher levels of disturbance (p <= 0.047), which suggests large vegetation gaps coupled with tall fences may limit transboundary movements. Female bighorn sheep crossed valleys up to 4.9 km wide, and microsatellite analyses indicated relatively high levels of gene flow and migration (95% CI for F-ST = 0.010-0.115, Nm = 1.9-24.8, M = 10.4-15.4) between populations divided by an 11-km valley. Models of gene flow based on regional topography and movement barriers suggested that nine populations of bighorn sheep in northwestern Sonora are linked by dispersal with those in neighboring Arizona. Disruption of transboundary movement corridors by impermeable fencing would isolate some populations on the Arizona side. Connectivity for other species with similar movement abilities and spatial distributions may be affected by border development, yet mitigation strategies could address needs of wildlife and humans.

Because of its contiguous distribution and extended breeding season this species might be expected to show a phylogeographic pattern of isolation by distance rather than divergent geographical lineages. To investigate population structure and make inferences about physical processes that have influenced gene flow in this species, two mitochondrial genes (ND2 and 16S) were sequenced for 64 frogs from across the distribution of the species. Phylogenetic analyses (parsimony and Bayesian) revealed two well-supported clades partitioning the range of this taxon, with one clade restricted to the northeast (summer rainfall) and the other restricted to the south (winter and aseasonal rainfall). The magnitude of sequence divergence between these clades is higher than expected, and is typical of levels of sequence divergence found among closely related species of pyxicephalid frogs. Phylogeographic analyses of sequence networks and spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) revealed additional geographical structure within each of these lineages. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of climatic transitions as barriers to gene flow and as potential agents for vicariant speciation.

Yet the concept of co-management is broad, and our knowledge about how different kinds of management structures affect the ability to deal with challenges pertinent to the commons is limited. One of these challenges is to foster an adaptive management process, i.e., a process in which rules are continuously revised and changed according to what is known about the ecological system. We aim to address the relationship between different kinds of co-management structures and adaptive management. To this end, we conducted a comparative case study of two Fishery Conservation Areas in Sweden. The concept of networks and the formal method of social network analysis are applied as theoretical and methodological devices. Building on previous research, we propose that adaptive management processes occur in co-management networks consisting of a heterogeneous set of actors that are centrally and densely integrated. Networks of this kind are believed to promote a management process in which actors with disparate perspectives and resources formulate a common view regarding the condition of the ecosystem, the basic problem to be solved, and what measures to adopt. The empirical findings support the existence of such a relationship. Nonetheless, the restricted empirical material, an inability to control for hidden variables, and a lack of success in determining causality among variables are all factors that call for more research.

In addition, in recent years, many proteins were identified with a role in the dynamics of the mitochondrial network. Using advanced imaging and an increasing number of cytological techniques, we have begun to realize that an important aspect to mtDNA maintenance., in both health and disease, is its organization within the dynamic mitochondrial network in discrete protein-DNA complexes usually termed nucleoids. Here, I review recent developments in the study of nucleoid dynamics and proteins. I will discuss the implications of the organization of mtDNA in nucleoids in light of DNA replication, repair, gene expression, segregation, and inheritance.

Marine Ecology Progress Series		2010		403		193-203	193	203	English						Fish spawning aggregations (FSA) are generally spatially and temporally predictable, making them particularly vulnerable to fishing, which is capable of rapidly removing a significant proportion of the aggregated adults and reducing egg production. These effects may cause the loss of the aggregation altogether. In the Northern Territory (NT), Australia, repeated fishing of known aggregations of the tropical sciaenid species, the blackspotted croaker Protonibea diacanthus, is probably unsustainable, particularly given this species decline elsewhere. Acoustic monitoring was used to examine the temporal and spatial movement patterns and site fidelity of P. diacanthus in the NT. Fish were only detected at their respective aggregations, providing no evidence of large-scale movements between FSA. There was evidence for behavioural polymorphism in the aggregations, and fish monitored for >= 1 yr showed decreased presence during cooler months and increased presence during warmer months when peak spawning occurs. The tidal cycle significantly influenced the detection of tagged fish, with detections peaking on running tides, the peak period for catching P. diacanthus, suggesting that this is when they feed. This study has provided important information on the connectivity and dynamics of P. diacanthus aggregations in the NT, including crucial information for implementing appropriate management strategies for this vulnerable species. There appears to be little interchange of adult P. diacanthus at the spatial scale examined, which suggests that the separate FSA examined support separate adult populations. The presence of seemingly separate spawning populations of P. diacanthus has significant implications for their management, with the potential for each aggregation to be vulnerable to localised depletion.

In this study, we use social network analysis to examine the relationship between primate group size, total brain size, neocortex ratio and several social network metrics concerned with network cohesion. Using female grooming networks from a number of Old World monkey species, we found that neocortex size was a better predictor of network characteristics than endocranial volumes. We further found that when we controlled for group size, neocortex ratio was negatively correlated with network density, connectivity, relative clan size and proportional clan membership, while there was no effect of neocortex ratio on change in connectivity following the removal of the most central female in the network. Thus, in species with larger neocortex ratios, females generally live in more fragmented networks, belong to smaller grooming clans and are members of relatively fewer clans despite living in a closely bonded group. However, even though groups are more fragmented to begin with among species with larger neocortices, the removal of the most central individual does cause groups to fall apart, suggesting that social complexity may ultimately involve the management of highly fragmented social groups while at the same time maintaining overall social cohesion. These results emphasize a need for more detailed brain data on a wider sample of primate species.	Dunbar, R. I.

Models were developed according to eel size-class and various different management strategies to improve accessibility, taking into account: (i) all the migration barriers from the tidal limit to different upstream limits (downstream-upstream strategy), (ii) all the migration barriers with a given degree of passability (migration barrier passability class strategy), (iii) all the migration barriers in a given sub-catchment area (sub-catchment strategy) and (iv) all the migration barriers in the entire Loire catchment (global strategy). Eel were actually found to occur in the Loire at about 50% of the sites sampled. The improvement of habitat accessibility by removing all obstacles to colonisation or installing fish passes, for example (global strategy), would lead to eels being found throughout the whole river. If this management strategy is impossible because the high cost, two others, also producing significant eel continental colonisation must be implemented. Either all barriers from the tidal limit with medium passability and/or migration barriers in the sub-catchment area which is closest to the sea and least accessible must be managed. In both cases, the area significantly exploited by eels and the probability that this species will be present will be doubled. However, these results can only be counted on if the fluvial recruitment increases significantly.

PLoS One		2009	NOV 18 2009	4	11	Article No.: e7873	e7873		English						Determining the structure of ectoparasite-host networks will enable disease ecologists to better understand and predict the spread of vector-borne diseases. If these networks have consistent properties, then studying the structure of well-understood networks could lead to extrapolation of these properties to others, including those that support emerging pathogens. Borrowing a quantitative measure of network structure from studies of mutualistic relationships between plants and their pollinators, we analyzed 29 ectoparasite-vertebrate host networks-including three derived from molecular bloodmeal analysis of mosquito feeding patterns-using measures of nestedness to identify non-random interactions among species. We found significant nestedness in ectoparasite-vertebrate host lists for habitats ranging from tropical rainforests to polar environments. These networks showed non-random patterns of nesting, and did not differ significantly from published estimates of nestedness from mutualistic networks. Mutualistic and antagonistic networks appear to be organized similarly, with generalized ectoparasites interacting with hosts that attract many ectoparasites and more specialized ectoparasites usually interacting with these same "generalized'' hosts. This finding has implications for understanding the network dynamics of vector-born pathogens. We suggest that nestedness (rather than random ectoparasite-host associations) can allow rapid transfer of pathogens throughout a network, and expand upon such concepts as the dilution effect, bridge vectors, and host switching in the context of nested ectoparasite-vertebrate host networks.

Adherens junctions play an especially prominent role in development because they link the adhesive function of cadherin-catenin protein complexes to the dynamic forces of the actin cytoskeleton, which helps to orchestrate a spatially confined and very dynamic assembly of intercellular connections. Intriguingly, in addition to maintaining intercellular adhesion, cadherin-catenin proteins are linked to several major developmental signaling pathways crucial for normal morphogenesis. In this article we will highlight the key genetic studies that uncovered the role of cadherin-catenin proteins in vertebrate development and discuss the potential role of these proteins as molecular biosensors of external cellular microenvironment that may spatially confine signaling molecules and polarity cues to orchestrate cellular behavior throughout the complex process of normal morphogenesis.

They spread westwards to Siberia and eastwards to the North American arctic and Greenland. The distribution of rock ptarmigan has been affected by glaciations restricting it to geographically limited refugia. Today the species has a circumpolar distribution in arctic tundra and alpine habitats, with up to 30 subspecies recognised based on morphological characters. We sequenced the mitochondrial control region for 72 individuals and genotyped 69 individuals for 12 microsatellite loci to investigate neutral genetic variation within and among five rock ptarmigan populations, Greenland, Iceland, Scandinavia, Svalbard and Taimyr. Genetic structure among the studied samples was high, overall F-ST estimated from microsatellite loci was 0.18 and only one out of 16 mtDNA haplotypes was found in more than one population. Genetic variation (h, pi, H-e, allelic richness) was slightly lower in the Svalbard population than in other populations, suggesting a low effective population size, possibly due to isolation following colonisation. An unrooted network and a phylogenetic tree showed that the Scandinavian population has diverged from the other populations by at least ten mutational steps, probably due to independent colonisation of Europe and subsequent long-term isolation, and rules out Scandinavia as a source for colonisation of Svalbard. Alignment with partial control region sequences from other studies showed that the haplotype that was central in our network and found on Svalbard and in Taimyr, most likely corresponds to a haplotype found in Siberia, Alaska and the Canadian Arctic, but not in Greenland, Scandinavia and Iceland. This suggests an eastern origin of rock ptarmigan in Svalbard, although this question cannot be settled conclusively.

SI	429-441	429	441	English						Vertebrate animals exhibit a spectacular diversity of social behaviors, yet a variety of basic social behavior processes are essential to all species. These include social signaling; discrimination of conspecifics and sexual partners; appetitive and consummatory sexual behaviors; aggression and dominance behaviors; and parental behaviors (the latter with rare exceptions). These behaviors are of fundamental importance and are regulated by an evolutionarily conserved, core social behavior network (SBN) of the limbic fore-brain and midbrain. The SBN encodes social information in a highly dynamic, distributed manner, such that behavior is most strongly linked to the pattern of neural activity across the SBN, not the activity of single loci. Thus, shifts in the relative weighting of activity across SBN nodes can conceivably produce almost limitless variation in behavior, including diversity across species (as weighting is modified through evolution), across behavioral contexts (as weights change temporally) and across behavioral phenotypes (as weighting is specified through heritable and developmental processes). Individual neural loci may also express diverse relationships to behavior, depending upon temporal variations in their functional connectivity to other brain regions ("neural context"). We here review the basic properties of the SBN and show how behavioral variation relates to functional connectivity of the network, and discuss ways in which neuroendocrine factors adjust network activity to produce behavioral diversity. In addition to the actions of steroid hormones on SBN state, we examine the temporally plastic and evolutionarily labile properties of the nonapeptides (the vasopressin-and oxytocin-like neuropeptides), and show how variations in nonapeptide signaling within the SBN serve to promote behavioral diversity across social contexts, seasons, phenotypes and species. Although this diversity is daunting in its complexity, the search for common "organizing principles" has become increasingly fruitful. We focus on multiple aspects of behavior, including sexual behavior, aggression and affiliation, and in each of these areas, we show how broadly relevant insights have been obtained through the examination of behavioral diversity in a wide range of vertebrate taxa.

Separate experiments showed that access to nectar flowers significantly increased female reproductive output, but not lifespan. Despite the effects on immigration and reproductive output, local population growth rates also showed no relationship to nectar flower density. Our results indicate that habitat quality can be important for immigration in spatially structured populations; however, effects of habitat quality may not necessarily translate into higher abundance or population growth. Additionally, habitat quality should not be considered independently from habitat isolation, particularly if it directly affects dispersal. Preserving or augmenting habitat quality will do little to bolster immigration or colonization without adequate connectivity.

A continuous characteristic frequency tone modulated by repeating pieces of low-frequency noises was used as a stimulus. This function was calculated as the correlation between the firing discharges evoked by different repeating pieces of the low-frequency noise. This approach allows one to exclude the influence of refractoriness and also considerably increases the repres. A comparison of the shiffled autocorrelation function with the conventional autocorrelation function allows one to estimate the temporal dynamics of changes in the postspike excitability of the neuron. An analysis of several examples demonstrates the possibility of facilitation just after the period of absolute refractoriness in some tonic units. Neurons demonstrating only a phasic response to the onset of unmodulated voice-frequency pieces were capable to selectively respond to special moments of noise amplitude modulation. These cells demonstrate an extremely high synchronism of reaction. In the cochlear nucleus of the frog, we described a neuron characterized by the internal periodicity of firing, which is not connected with the dynamics of arriving stimuli.	Bibikov, N.

Colonisation is a critical ecological process influencing both population and community level dynamics by connecting spatially discrete habitat patches. How communities respond to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances, furthermore, requires a basic understanding of how any environmental change modifies colonisation rates. For example, disturbance-induced shifts in the quantity of forest cover surrounding aquatic habitats have been associated with the distribution and abundance of numerous aquatic taxa. However, the mechanisms generating these broad and repeatable field patterns are unclear.2. Such patterns of diversity could result from differential spatial mortality post colonisation, or from colonisation alone if species select sites non-randomly along canopy coverage gradients. We examined the colonisation/oviposition dynamics of aquatic beetles in experimental ponds placed under both open and closed forest canopies.3. Canopy coverage imposed a substantial behavioural filter on the colonisation and reproduction of aquatic beetles representing multiple trophic levels, and resulted in significantly higher abundance, richness, and oviposition activity in open canopy ponds. These patterns strengthened overtime; although early in the experiment, the most abundant beetle had similar abundance in open and closed ponds. However, its abundance subsequently declined and then most other species heavily colonised open canopy ponds.4. The primary response of many aquatic species to disturbances that generate canopy coverage gradients surrounding aquatic ecosystems is behavioural. The magnitude of the colonisation responses reported here rivals, if not exceeds, those produced by predators, suggesting that aquatic landscapes are behaviourally assessed and partitioned across multiple environmental gradients. The community level structure produced solely by selective colonisation, is predicted to strongly modify how patch area and isolation affect colonisation rates and the degree to which communities are linked by the flux of individuals and species.

However, very little is known about how pathogen pressure has affected the molecular evolution of genes involved in their innate immune system. We have studied the sequence evolution of several immune genes in ants and honeybees. The results show high rates of evolution in both ants and honeybees as measured by the ratio of amino acid changes to silent nucleotide changes, the ratio being clearly higher than in Drosophila immune genes or in nonimmunity genes of bees. This conforms to our expectations based on high pathogen pressure in social insects. The codon-based likelihood method found clear evidence of positive selection only in one ant gene, even though positive selection has earlier been found in both ant and termite immune genes. There is now indication that selection on the amino acid composition of the immune-related genes has been an important part in the fight against pathogens by social insects. However, we cannot distinguish in all the cases whether the high observed d(N)/d(S) ratio results from positive selection within a restricted part of the studied genes or from relaxation of purifying selection associated with effective measures of behaviorally based colony-level defenses.

At the heart of this conflict in a number of taxa is male harassment of females for mating opportunities and female strategies to avoid this harassment. One neglected consequence that may result from sexual harassment is the disruption of important social associations. Here, we experimentally manipulate the degree of sexual harassment that wild female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) experience by establishing replicated, semi-natural pools with different population sex ratios. We quantify the effects of sexual harassment on female social structure and the development of social recognition among females. When exposed to sexual harassment, we found that females had more disparate social networks with limited repeated interactions when compared to females that did not experience male harassment. Furthermore, females that did not experience harassment developed social recognition with familiar individuals over an 8-day period, whereas females that experienced harassment did not, an effect we suggest is due to disruption of association patterns. These results show that social network structure and social recognition can be affected by sexual harassment, an effect that will be relevant across taxonomic groups and that we predict will have fitness consequences for females.

The local correlation coefficients show a species-specific multi-scaling behaviour: close to random correlations on the scale of a few base pairs, a first maximum from 40 to 3,400 bp (for Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanogaster divided in two submaxima), and often a region of one or more second maxima from 10(5) to 3 x 10(5) bp. Within this multi-scaling behaviour, an additional fine-structure is present and attributable to codon usage in all except the human sequences, where it is related to nucleosomal binding. Computer-generated random sequences assuming a block organization of genomes, the codon usage, and nucleosomal binding explain these results. Mutation by sequence reshuffling destroyed all correlations. Thus, the stability of correlations seems to be evolutionarily tightly controlled and connected to the spatial genome organization, especially on large scales. In summary, genomes show a complex sequential organization related closely to their three-dimensional organization.

Oecologia (Berlin)		2009	JUL 2009	160	4	697-706	697	706	English						This study characterizes the structure of a plant-pollinator network in a temperate rain forest of Chilo, Island, southern Chile, where woody species are strongly dependent on biotic pollinators, and analyzes its robustness to the loss of participating species. Degree distribution, nestedness, and expected species persistence were evaluated. In addition, we assessed the roles of predefined subsets of plants (classified by life forms) and pollinators (grouped by taxonomic orders) in the network's structure and dynamics. For this, we simulated the complete removal of each plant and pollinator subset and analyzed the resultant connectivity patterns, as well as the expected long-term species losses by running a stochastic model. Finally, we evaluated the sensitivity of the network structure to the loss of single species in order to identify potential targets for conservation. Our results show that the plant-pollinator network of this Chilean temperate rain forest exhibits a nested structure of interactions, with a degree distribution best described by a power law model. Model simulations revealed the importance of trees and hymenopterans as pivotal groups that maintain the core structure of the pollination network and guarantee overall species persistence. The hymenopterans Bombus dahlbomii and Diphaglossa gayi, the shrubs Tepualia stipularis and Ugni molinae, the vines Mitraria coccinea and Asteranthera ovata, and the entire set of tree species exerted a disproportionately large influence on the preservation of network structure and should be considered as focal species for conservation programs given current threats from selective logging and habitat loss.

(ruan@math.miami.edu)									Journal of Theoretical Biology		2009	JUN 21 2009	258	4	550-560	550	560	English						With the recent resurgence of vector-borne diseases due to urbanization and development there is an urgent need to understand the dynamics of vector-borne diseases in rapidly changing urban environments. For example, many empirical studies have produced the disturbing finding that diseases continue to persist in modern city centers with zero or low rates of transmission. We develop spatial models of vector-borne disease dynamics on a network of patches to examine how the movement of humans in heterogeneous environments affects transmission. We show that the movement of humans between patches is sufficient to maintain disease persistence in patches with zero transmission. We construct two classes of models using different approaches: (i) Lagrangian models that mimic human commuting behavior and (ii) Eulerian models that mimic human migration. We determine the basic reproduction number R-0 for both modeling approaches. We show that for both approaches that if the disease-free equilibrium is stable (R-0 < 1) then it is globally stable and if the disease-free equilibrium is unstable (R-0 > 1) then there exists a unique positive (endemic) equilibrium that is globally stable among positive solutions. Finally, we prove in general that Lagrangian and Eulerian modeling approaches are not equivalent. The modeling approaches presented provide a framework to explore spatial vector-borne disease dynamics and control in heterogeneous environments. As an example, we consider two patches in which the disease dies out in both patches when there is no movement between them. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the disease becomes endemic in both patches when humans move between the two patches. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Drawing on research in seven coastal fishing communities in Loreto, Baja California Sur, Mexico, we examine the effect of resource scarcity on the bonding, bridging, and linking social-capital patterns of fishers' information-sharing networks. We found that: (1) fishers' information sharing is activated in response to varying ecological conditions; (2) resource scarcity is an ambiguous indicator of the extent to which fishers share information on the abundance and location of fish within and between communities; (3) information sharing is based on trust and occurs through kinship, friendship, and acquaintance social relations; (4) friendship ties play a key and flexible role in fishers' social networks within and between communities; (5) overall, the composition of fishers' social networks follows a friendship>kinship>acquaintance order of importance; and (6) the function of social ties, internal conflict, and settlement histories moderate the effects of resource scarcity on fishers' social capital. We conclude by arguing that the livelihoods of fishers from Loreto have adaptive capacity for dealing with fish fluctuations but little or no proactive resilience to address resource- management issues.

It has attracted particular attention by those attempting to unravel social structure in fission-fusion populations. It is clear that the social network approach offers some exciting opportunities for gaining new insights into social systems. However, some of the practices which are currently being used in the animal social networks literature are at worst questionable and at best over-enthusiastic. We highlight some of the areas of method, analysis and interpretation in which greater care may be needed in order to ensure that the biology we extract from our networks is robust. In particular, we suggest that more attention should be given to whether relational data are representative, the potential effect of observational errors and the choice and use of statistical tests. The importance of replication and manipulation must not be forgotten, and the interpretation of results requires care.

The structure of this interaction network is therefore crucial to our understanding of colony organization and functioning. In this paper, I study the properties of the interaction network in the colonies of the social wasp Ropalidia marginata. I find that the network is characterized by a uniform connectivity among individuals with increasing heterogeneity as colonies become larger. Important network parameters are found to be correlated with colony size and I investigate how this is reflected in the organization of work in colonies of different sizes. Finally, I test the resilience of these interaction networks by experimental removal of individuals from the colony and discuss the structural properties of the network that are related to resilience in a social network.

Ecological Research		2009	MAY 2009	24	3	505-519	505	519	English						Key elements of the rapidly expanding field of ecosystem-based management include: (a) understanding connections among social and ecological systems and (b) developing analytical approaches to inform the necessary trade-offs among ecosystem services and human activities in coastal and marine areas. To address these needs, we investigate the impacts of multiple economic sectors on the marine ecosystem and dependent human community in the Gulf of California with an ecological-economic model. We focus on the spotted rose snapper (Lutjanus guttatus), an economically important species targeted concurrently by the nearshore artisanal fleet, the sportfishing fleet, and by the industrial shrimp fleet as bycatch. Economic returns to the local community are driven by the artisanal fishery catch and the number of tourists who engage in the sportsfishery, and these variables are in turn impacted by fish abundance. We find that the coexistence of the two sectors (and production of both seafood and tourism services) creates stability in key elements of the coupled systems. When the coupled systems are perturbed by changes in exploitation and climate variability, the artisanal fishery responds more rapidly and to a greater degree than the sportsfishery to shifts in the fish population. Our results suggest that vital components of coupled systems may well respond differently to climate variability or other perturbations, and that management strategies should be developed with this in mind. Models like ours can facilitate the development and testing of hypotheses about the form and strength of interactions between ecosystems, services, and the human communities that rely on them.

Analysis of the spatial structure of critical habitats and how it affects endemic species in this region is essential baseline information for biodiversity monitoring and management. We quantified and evaluated the spatial structure and connectivity of depression forests on Mona Island and their potential impact on Mona Island rock iguana habitat, as a framework to assess spatial distribution, connectivity, and the issue of scale in small and widely dispersed habitats. Using IKONOS imagery, we mapped and delineated depression forests at four different scales (minimum mapping units: < 100, 100, 500, and 1,000 m), and calculated landscape metrics describing their spatial structure, and connectivity, for each map resolution. Our approach resulted in a more detailed map than previously described maps, providing better information on habitat connectivity for iguanas. The comparison of the island landscape mapped at different scales provided evidence on how changing scales affect the output of spatial metrics and may have a significant impact when planning decisions and assigning conservation priorities. It also highlighted the importance of adequate ecological scales when addressing landscape management and conservation priorities. The analysis of landscapes at multiple scales provided a mechanism to evaluate the role of patch detection and its effect on the interpretation of connectivity and spatial structure of suitable areas for species with small and widely dispersed habitats. These methodologies can be applied other species, in different environments, with similar limitations related to connectivity and habitat availability.

In sensorimotor tasks resembling navigational performance, the serial order of objects is intimately connected with spatial order. Mammals and birds develop episodic(like) memory in serial spatio-temporal tasks, and the honeybee learns spatio-temporal order when navigating between the nest and a food source. Here I examine the structure of the bees' memory for a combined spatio-temporal task. I ask whether discrimination and generalization are based solely on simple forms of stimulus-reward learning or whether they require sequential configurations. Animals were trained to fly either left or right in a continuous T-maze. The correct choice was signaled by the sequence of colors (blue, yellow) at four positions in the access arm. If only one of the possible 4 signals is shown (either blue or yellow), the rank order of position salience is 1, 2 and 3 (numbered from T-junction). No learning is found if the signal appears at position 4. If two signals are shown, differences at positions 1 and 2 are learned best, those at position 3 at a low level, and those at position 4 not at all. If three or more signals are shown these results are corroborated. This salience rank order again appeared in transfer tests, but additional configural phenomena emerged. Most of the results can be explained with a simple model based on the assumption that the four positions are equipped with different salience scores and that these add up independently. However, deviations from the model are interpreted by assuming stimulus configuration of sequential patterns. It is concluded that, under the conditions chosen, bees rely most strongly on memories developed during simple forms of associative reward learning, but memories of configural serial patterns contribute, too.

All three variables were significantly related to species richness and explained 61% of the variance in a data set from 55 limnologically similar lakes in northern Wisconsin. We developed additional ANCOVA models to assess the relative effects of these three variables on four functional species groups, including gamefish, riverine, tolerant, and intolerant species. The number of gamefish species was greater in lakes with riparian development than in undeveloped lakes; this is probably related to introductions by management agencies and anglers. Connectivity increased the number of riverine species and intolerant species. Intolerant species may be more abundant because connecting streams provide colonization routes and decrease time between periodic extirpation and recolonization events. In addition, flowing water connections may provide a refuge from winter hypoxia and decrease extirpation rates of intolerant A species. Tolerant fishes were ubiquitous on the landscape and unaffected by the measured variables. Because simple landscape variables can dominate assemblage dynamics of small takes, and human-mediated introductions can increase species richness at low and moderate levels of disturbance, the use of fish as biological indicators for small lake assessment is not practical.

(lwbotsford@ucdavis.edu) ; Brumbaugh, Daniel R.; Grimes, Churchill; Kellner, Julie B.; Largier, John; O'Farrell, Michael R.; Ralston, Stephen; Soulanille, Elaine; Wespestad, Vidar									Reviews in Fish Biology and Fisheries		2009	MAR 2009	19	1	69-95	69	95	English						A substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties.

Diane; Berger, Jonathan; Alverdy, John; O'Keefe, James; Bassler, Bonnie; Rinker-Schaeffer, Carrie (crinkers@uchicago.edu)									Clinical & Experimental Metastasis		2009	JAN 2009	26	1	67-76	67	76	English						The biochemical and biological mechanisms metastatic cancer cells use to function as communities and thwart internal and external growth control mechanisms remain undefined. In this work, we present the hypothesis that cancer cells may use a Quorum-Sensing mechanism to regulate multicellular functions and control steps in metastatic colonization. Quorum sensing is a bacterial cell-cell communication process used to track increasing cell-population density and, in response to changes in cell number, coordinate gene expression and behavior on a community-wide scale. Important parallels between the behavior of societies of bacterial cells and societies of malignant cancer cells exist in the bacterial literature. Of relevance to metastasis is the finding that pathogenic bacteria use quorum sensing to determine when their population numbers are high enough to collectively form biofilms in or on host organisms. Biofilms are complex, heterogeneous communities of bacterial cells encased within an extracellular matrix attached to a solid surface. Biofilms exacerbate disease and are refractory to a battery of therapies. We suggest that the quorum-sensing-controlled bacterial biofilm formation process closely parallels the steps in metastatic colonization. Cells migrate toward/on target surfaces (organ-specific homing), show cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions (tumor cell-stromal cell crosstalk), remain subclinical until they can mount an effective attack (dormancy), form complex structures with channels for nutrient flow (vascularized lesions), and contain resistant cells which can cause disease recurrence (persistors). Using ovarian cancer as an example, we present data supporting the connection between metastatic colonization and quorum sensing and discuss the implications for understanding and controlling metastasis formation.

Tellervo									Microbial Pathogenesis		2009	JAN 2009	46	1	21-27	21	27	English						Four different colony morphologies were produced by Flavobacterium columnare strains on Shieh agar plate cultures: rhizoid and flat (type 1), non-rhizoid and hard (type 2), round and soft (type 3), and irregularly shaped and soft (type 4). Colonies produced on AO agar differed from these to some extent. The colony types formed on Shieh agar were studied according to molecular characteristics [Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP), Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis (ARISA), and whole cell protein SDS-PAGE profiles], virulence on rainbow trout fingerlings, and adhesion on polystyrene and fish gills. There were no molecular differences between colony types within one strain. Type 2 was the most adherent on polystyrene, but type 1 was the most virulent. Adhesion of F. columnare strains used in this study was not connected to virulence. From fish infected with colony type 1, three colony types (types 1, 2 and 4) were isolated. Contrary to previous studies, our results suggest that strong adhesion capacity may not be the main virulence factor of F. columnare. Colony morphology change might be caused by phase variation, and different colony types isolated from infected fish may indicate different roles of the colony morphologies in the infection process of columnaris disease.

Pathogens have evolved strategies to breach structural barriers and avoid or counter preformed and induced chemical defenses of their host plants. Plants have evolved sensitive mechanisms to perceive bioagressors and innate immune responses are activated when plants encounter non-adapted microbes, virulent microbes and insects, or when plants engage in a gene-for-gene resistance response. The earliest events in innate immunity are triggered by the perception of the mechanical and chemical signals associated with injury and highly conserved molecules called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which signal the presence of a nonself organism (i.e., a microbial or animal aggressor). Using mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, PAMP-triggered immunity integrates with the salicylic acid (SA)-, jasmonic acid (JA)-, and ethylene (ET)-regulated defense pathways. This complex and dynamic network provides effective, inducible defenses to resist pathogens and herbivores. Consistent with the defense arms race of plants and pathogens, these intruders attempt to derail defenses by the strategic deployment of virulence factors or effectors. In this chapter, the similarities and distinctions of the adaptive defense strategies used by pathogens and insect herbivores to recover nutrients and promote their establishment and proliferation on host plants will be emphasized. The role of PAMPs and the distinctive chemical nature of herbivore elicitors and effectors in plant-herbivore interactions are discussed.

Data were gathered with pitfall traps in 1998 and explored by ordination and grouping methods. Our analysis revealed that the presence of xerothermic spider species was limited to scarcely covered, less dynamic gravel banks. Riparian spider species were found on frequently flooded as well as on rather elevated and high gravel banks, while riparian carabid beetles were dominant on all sampled banks. The level of flooding disturbance, the vegetation density and the presence of silt appeared to be the most important environmental determinants of spider and carabid beetle assemblage structure. Consequently, local environmental factors influence species occurrence patterns in a similar way for the two investigated arthropod groups. Nevertheless, distinct ecological groups are differently ordered along the prime environmental gradients. Nature management should therefore consider the conservation, restoration and connectivity of both dynamic and more elevated banks in order to obtain a high degree of local and regional heterogeneity throughout the river system.

Climate change has been inducing range shifts for many species as they follow their suitable climate space and further shifts are projected. Whether species will be able to colonize regions where climate conditions become suitable, so-called 'new climate space', depends on species traits and habitat fragmentation.2. By combining bioclimate envelope models with dispersal models, we identified areas where the spatial cohesion of the ecosystem pattern is expected to be insufficient to allow colonization of new climate space.3. For each of three ecosystem types, three species were selected that showed a shift in suitable climate space and differed in habitat fragmentation sensitivity.4. For the 2020 and 2050 time slices, the amount of climatically suitable habitat in northwest Europe diminished for all studied species. Additionally, significant portions of new suitable habitat could not be colonized because of isolation. Together, this will result in a decline in the amount of suitable habitat protected in Natura 2000 sites.5. We develop several adaptation strategies to combat this problem: (i) link isolated habitat that is within a new suitable climate zone to the nearest climate-proof network; (ii) increase colonizing capacity in the overlap zone, the part of a network that remains suitable in successive time frames; (iii) optimize sustainable networks in climate refugia, the part of a species' range where the climate remains stable.6. Synthesis and applications. Following the method described in this study, we can identify those sites across Europe where ecosystem patterns are not cohesive enough to accommodate species' responses to climate change. The best locations for climate corridors where improving connectivity is most urgent and potential gain is highest can then be pinpointed.

(dmaney@emory.edu) ; Goode, Christopher T.; Lange, Henry S.; Sanford, Sara E.; Solomon, Benjamin L.									Journal of Comparative Neurology		2008	NOV 10 2008	511	2	173-186	173	186	English						Social behaviors such as courtship, parenting, and aggression depend primarily on two factors: a social signal to trigger the behavior, and a hormonal milieu that facilitates or permits it. Gonadal steroids may alter the valence or perceived context of the signal so that the same pheromone, vocalization, or visual display may elicit very different responses depending on the receiver's plasma hormone level. The neural processes underlying this phenomenon, however, are not well understood. Here, we describe bow hormones modulate neural responses to social signals in female white-throated sparrows listening to recordings of male song. While manipulating levels of the ovarian steroid estradiol, we mapped and quantified sound-induced expression of the immediate early gene egr-1 in nine brain regions that constitute a social behavior network in vertebrates. In most regions of interest, hearing male song induced more expression than hearing tones or silence, and this selectivity for song was seen only in birds with estradiol levels typical of the breeding season. In females with regressed ovaries and no exogenous estradiol, neural responses were selective for song over tones only in the lateral portion of the ventromedial hypothalamus, not in the rest of the network. Because the effects of hormone treatment on neural responses are not identical in each region, the overall pattern of activation across the network changes with estradiol level and thus with season and breeding context. Our results demonstrate a possible mechanism by which gonadal steroids may alter the processing of social signals and affect social decision-making. J. Comp. Neurol. 511:173-186, 2008.

Although theoretical models of transmission dynamics have placed an overwhelming emphasis on the importance of understanding the network structure in a social group, empirical data regarding such contact structures are rare. In this paper, I analyze the network structure and the correlated transmission dynamics within a honeybee colony as determined by food transfer interactions and the changes produced in it by an experimental manipulation. The study demonstrates that widespread transmission in the colony is correlated to a lower clustering coefficient and higher robustness of the social network. I also show that the social network in the colony is determined by the spatial distribution of various age classes, and the resulting organizational structure provides some amount of immunity to the young individuals. The results of this study demonstrates how, using the honeybee colony as a model system, concepts in network theory can be combined with those in behavioral ecology to gain a better understanding of social transmission processes, especially those related to disease dynamics.

Understanding the relation between the structure and the function for such systems is a considerable challenge. We need tools to identify key points of regulation, illuminate such issues as robustness and control and aid in the design of experiments. Here, I tackle this by developing new techniques for sensitivity analysis. In particular, I show how to globally analyse the sensitivity of a complex system by means of two new graphical objects: the sensitivity heat map and the parameter sensitivity spectrum. The approach to sensitivity analysis is global in the sense that it studies the variation in the whole of the model's solution rather than focusing on output variables one at a time, as in classical sensitivity analysis. This viewpoint relies on the discovery of local geometric rigidity for such systems, the mathematical insight that makes a practicable approach to such problems feasible for highly complex systems. In addition, we demonstrate a new summation theorem that substantially generalizes previous results for oscillatory and other dynamical phenomena. This theorem can be interpreted as a mathematical law stating the need for a balance between fragility and robustness in such systems.	Rand, D.

Animal cardiovascular and respiratory systems, and plant vasculature, are branching trees whose architecture is thought to determine universal scaling laws in these organisms. In contrast, the transport systems of many multi-cellular fungi do not fit into this conceptual framework, as they have evolved to explore a patchy environment in search of new resources, rather than ramify through a three-dimensional organism. These fungi grow as a foraging mycelium, formed by the branching and fusion of threadlike hyphae, that gives rise to a complex network. To function efficiently, the mycelial network must both transport nutrients between spatially separated source and sink regions and also maintain its integrity in the face of continuous attack by mycophagous insects or random damage. Here we review the development of novel imaging approaches and software tools that we have used to characterise nutrient transport and network formation in foraging mycelia over a range of spatial scales. On a millimetre scale, we have used a combination of time-lapse confocal imaging and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching to quantify the rate of diffusive transport through the unique vacuole system in individual hyphae. These data then form the basis of a simulation model to predict the impact of such diffusion-based movement on a scale of several millimetres. On a centimetre scale, we have used novel photon-counting scintillation imaging techniques to visualize radiolabel movement in small microcosms. This approach has revealed novel N-transport phenomena, including rapid, preferential N-resource allocation to C-rich sinks, induction of simultaneous bi-directional transport, abrupt switching between different pre-existing transport routes, and a strong pulsatile component to transport in some species. Analysis of the pulsatile transport component using Fourier techniques shows that as the colony forms, it self-organizes into well demarcated domains that are identifiable by differences in the phase relationship of the pulses. On the centimetre to metre scale, we have begun to use techniques borrowed from graph theory to characterize the development and dynamics of the network, and used these abstracted network models to predict the transport characteristics, resilience, and cost of the network.

Molecular Ecology		2008	AUG 2008	17	15	3496-3505	3496	3505	English						Gene flow in riverine species is constrained by the dendritic (branching) structure of the river network. Spatial genetic structure (SGS) of freshwater insects is particularly influenced by catchment characteristics and land use in the surroundings of the river. Gene flow also depends on the life cycle of organisms. Aquatic larvae mainly drift downstream whereas flying adults can disperse actively overland and along watercourses. In-stream movements can generate isolation by distance (IBD) at a local scale and differentiation between subcatchments. However, these patterns can be disrupted by overland dispersal. We studied SGS across the Loire River in the damselfly Calopteryx splendens which is able to disperse along and between watercourses. Our sampling design allowed us to test for overland dispersal effects on genetic differentiation between watercourses. Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers revealed high genetic differentiation at the catchment scale but the genetic structure did not reflect the geographical structure of sampling sites. We observed IBD patterns when considering the distance following the watercourse but also the Euclidean distance, i.e. the shortest distance, between pairs of sites. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis of overland dispersal between watercourses. From a conservation perspective, attention should be paid to the actual pathways of gene flow across complex landscapes such as river networks.

In Mycobacterium tuberculosis EthR binds to a specific operator (O-ethR) thereby repressing ethA and preventing EthA-catalyzed conversion of the prodrug ethionamide, which increases the resistance of the pathogen to this last-line-of-defense treatment. We have designed a synthetic mammalian gene circuit that senses the EthR-O-ethR interaction in human cells and produces a quantitative reporter gene expression readout. Challenging of the synthetic network with compounds of a rationally designed chemical library revealed 2-phenylethyl-butyrate as a nontoxic substance that abolished EthR's repressor function inside human cells, in mice, and within M. tuberculosis where it triggered derepression of ethA and increased the sensitivity of this pathogen to ethionamide. The discovery of antituberculosis compounds by using synthetic mammalian gene circuits may establish a new line of defense against multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis.

Studies on tropical birds, which tend to experience ecological conditions that diverge from those of higher latitude birds, have been invaluable in showcasing such variation. Here we review recent advances in tropical avian field endocrinology, focusing on male circulating testosterone concentrations during the breeding season. We summarize the evidence for a decrease in male circulating testosterone concentrations from high towards low latitudes. We revisit both established and recently proposed ecological hypotheses that attempt to explain the existence of this pattern, as well as the variation in testosterone concentrations and dynamics within tropical populations of birds. We highlight additional social and life history variables that may need to be considered if we aim at gaining an integrated understanding of the ultimate factors that influence the relationship between hormonal signals and behavioral traits in natural populations, Understanding the ecological factors that influence circulating hormone concentrations will be an important first step in our understanding of the evolutionary processes that are at the basis of variations in hormone-behavior connections. Such findings should be supplemented by studies on functional aspects of the testosterone signal at the organismal and cellular level. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Some core components of the mitochondrial fission/fusion machinery, including the dynamin-like GTPases Drp1, Mitofusin, Opa1, and the Drp1-interacting protein Fis1, have been identified. How the fission and fusion processes are regulated under normal conditions and the extent to which defects in mitochondrial fission/fusion are involved in various disease conditions are poorly understood. Mitochondrial malfunction tends to cause diseases with brain and skeletal muscle manifestations and has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Whether abnormal mitochondrial fission or fusion plays a role in PD pathogenesis has not been shown. Here, we show that Pink1, a mitochondria-targeted Ser/Thr kinase linked to familial PID, genetically interacts with the mitochondrial fission/fusion machinery and modulates mitochondrial dynamics. Genetic manipulations that promote mitochondrial fission suppress Drosophila Pink1 mutant phenotypes in indirect flight muscle and dopamine neurons, whereas decreased fission has opposite effects. In Drosophila and mammalian cells, overexpression of Pink1 promotes mitochondrial fission, whereas inhibition of Pink1 leads to excessive fusion. Our genetic interaction results suggest that Fis1 may act in-between Pink1 and Drp1 in controlling mitochondrial fission. These results reveal a cell biological role for Pink1 and establish mitochondrial fission/fusion as a paradigm for PID research. Compounds that modulate mitochondrial fission/fusion could have therapeutic value in PD intervention.

Theoretical Population Biology		2008	MAY 2008	73	3	383-394	383	394	English						Models of infectious diseases are characterized by a phase transition between extinction and persistence. A challenge in contemporary epidemiology is to understand how the geometry of a host's interaction network influences disease dynamics close to the critical point of such a transition. Here we address this challenge with the help of moment closures. Traditional moment closures, however, do not provide satisfactory predictions close to such critical points. We therefore introduce a new method for incorporating longer-range correlations into existing closures. Our method is technically simple, remains computationally tractable and significantly improves the approximation's performance. Our extended closures thus provide an innovative tool for quantifying the influence of interaction networks on spatially or socially structured disease dynamics. In particular, we examine the effects of a network's clustering coefficient, as well as of new geometrical measures, such as a network's square clustering coefficients. We compare the relative performance of different closures from the literature, with or without our long-range extension. In this way, we demonstrate that the normalized version of the Bethe approximation - extended to incorporate long-range correlations according to our method - is an especially good candidate for studying influences of network structure. Our numerical results highlight the importance of the clustering coefficient and the square clustering coefficient for predicting disease dynamics at low and intermediate values of transmission rate, and demonstrate the significance of path redundancy for disease persistence.

This study was conducted to determine the utility of social network analysis for deciphering patterns of aggression and wounding in rhesus macaques. Over 37,000 observations of affiliative, submissive and aggressive activities were collected over a 3-year period on similar to 1300 rhesus macaques housed in 13.2 ha enclosures. Data also were analyzed on management factors such as age/sex composition and matriline configuration that might promote or reduce aggression in rhesus macaques. Results suggest that social network measures such as subordination degree (social power), displacement fragmentation and groom reciprocity within social groups were not only significantly associated with rates of contact aggression and wounding but with the occurrence of severe aggressive outbreaks, known as cage wars. In addition, groups with a lower proportion of adult females and a more uniform distribution in the number of individuals across matrilines exhibited higher social power and lower fragmentation. These data indicate that by manipulating group composition and matriline configuration of social groups to promote social cohesion and stability, behavioral managers may be able to reduce the level of aggression and aggression-based morbidity and mortality. These data also show that social network measures are valuable predictors of deleterious aggression and even cage wars indicating that such measures could be used to longitudinally track changes in social dynamics to detect significant instabilities, allowing managers to prevent severe outbreaks before they occur in populations of rhesus macaques and perhaps other non-human primate species.

Antibody staining reveals the distribution of at least ten different populations of glycinergic and GABAergic neurons in the CNS. Single neuron recording and marker injections have been used to study the roles and anatomy of three types of inhibitory neuron in the swimming behaviour of the tadpole. Spinal commissural interneurons control alternation of the two sides by producing glycinergic reciprocal inhibition. By interacting with the special membrane properties of excitatory interneurons they also contribute to rhythm generation through post-inhibitory rebound. Spinal ascending interneurons produce recurrent glycinergic inhibition of sensory pathways that gates reflex responses during swimming. In addition their inhibition also limits firing in CPG neurons during swimming. Midhindbrain reticulospinal neurons are excited by pressure to the head and produce powerful GABAergic inhibition that stops swimming when the tadpole swims into solid objects. They may also produce tonic inhibition while the tadpole is at rest that reduces spontaneous swimming and responsiveness of the tadpole, keeping it still so it is not noticed by predators.

On a local scale, disease tends to increase the interactions among patches on a landscape, particularly through changes in the frequency and severity of disturbances and increases in the vulnerability of ecosystems to fundamental changes in state in response to such disturbances. In addition, human activities that alter landscape structure or connectivity often increase the likelihood of disease epidemics or landscape sensitivity to disease. In contrast, on global and regional scales, disease tends to reduce landscape connectivity because the social response to these ecological changes is often to restrict trade and migration. Both the increase in connectivity on the local scale and the decrease in connectivity on regional to global scales can profoundly affect ecosystem structure and functioning.Resilience theory addresses the factors that make systems either resilient or vulnerable to radical changes in state by considering interactions between the ecological and social components of systems. This provides a framework for predicting the regional impacts of disease and reducing their social consequences. Resilience is facilitated by fostering cultural and ecological legacies that provide seeds for recovery; by maintaining biological, social, institutional, and economic diversity, which increases the options for alternative pathways of recovery; and by fostering learning and innovation, which reduces the potential impacts of disease and increases the likelihood of favorable social change.

Although comprising only a small fraction of the total area, semi-natural elements provide habitat for most of the landscape biodiversity. Agricultural intensification has increasingly fragmented semi-natural elements and species numbers are in decline. Insights into the effects of landscape structure on species' distributions within and among semi-natural habitats are needed to conserve biodiversity in agricultural landscapes more effectively. We investigated the landscape- and habitat-specific diversity partitions of wild bees, true bugs, and carabid beetles in two differently structured agricultural landscapes in Switzerland. In each landscape, we partitioned the total species diversity (gamma) into its additive components within (alpha(P)) and among patches (beta(P)) and among habitats (beta(H)). In the landscape characterized by a patchy, isolated distribution of habitat elements, among-patch diversity (beta(P)) explained 44% of the total species richness (gamma) and was significantly higher than expected under a random distribution of samples among habitat patches; in the landscape with higher habitat connectivity, among-patch diversity (beta(P)) comprised 32% of the total species richness (gamma) and did not differ from the random expectation. Habitat-specific within-patch contributions to species richness were similarly low across habitat types (alpha(P) = 23-24%) in the patchy landscape, whereas in the more connected landscape within-patch partitions tended to be higher and differed among habitat types (alpha(P) = 22-38%). Functionally different groups of bees, true bugs, and carabids also responded differently to landscape structure in a manner that was consistent with known differences in resource specialization and dispersal ability. Differences in diversity partitions among landscapes and taxa indicate the need for flexible conservation strategies. Conservation of habitat-specific diversity may require more habitat patches in landscapes that have lower habitat connectivity and low within-patch diversity (alpha(P)) than in landscapes with higher within-patch diversity (alpha(P)).

In this chapter, we highlight the key abiotic and community-level interactions that determine odonate community structure. We focus on three important life-history-based issues central to odonate communities: habitat access, response to risk during the larval stage, and emergence and reproduction. We approach each issue by considering relevant ecological theory and identify and review empirical studies with odonates that address hypotheses raised by theoretical studies. For habitat access, a dominant role is played by hydroperiod, because it underlies the transition from mainly invertebrate predators to insectivorous fish predators and imposes a significant abiotic constraint on larval development. Habitat access may be strongly influenced by dispersal behaviour, which in turn may be related to the degree of habitat specialization, but few studies have been able to connect dispersal behaviour with predation and larval performance. As larvae, odonates must respond to risk imposed by predators. The types of predators present, such as fish, other odonate species, and conspecifics, strongly influence the level of risk. Consequently, we focus on the primary ecological interactions that occur within odonate communities, including intraguild predation, interference competition, and cannibalism, which seem to play a more important role in structuring odonate communities than exploitative competition. In most cases body size, which is affected by the relative growth and phenology of species in the community, strongly impacts the direction and intensity of these ecological interactions. Finally, we consider how the adult stage may be affected by the larval stage and how it may affect the community interactions at the larval stage. The role of adults in odonate community ecology has received much less attention than that of larvae. However, larval interactions can influence the body size and emergence time of adults, which may have a direct impact on adult fitness. Furthermore, interactions among heterospecific adults, which are driven primarily by constraints imposed by their mating and sensory systems, may affect the relative spatial and temporal distribution of sympatric species. Although numerous short-term studies at relatively small spatial scales have been conducted with odonate larvae, we still know very little about the relative impacts of competition, cannibalism, and predation on odonate population dynamics and community structure in natural systems. Long-term studies at multiple life-history stages and levels of organization are required to generate a more complete understanding of odonate communities, and of ecological communities in general.

It is important to understand what motivates and constrains people's fishing participation. In 2005, we mailed surveys to 900 male and 900 female residents of the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota (USA) metropolitan area to determine attitudes and beliefs about outdoor recreation and fishing. Based on Survey responses from 39.3% of the sample, we examined factors that motivate and constrain fishing among urban and suburban residents. Five factors motivated outdoor recreation: (a) achievement, (b) appreciation, (c) personal development, (d) affiliation, and (e) health. Appreciation and health were the most important motivators for outdoor recreation. Fishing was seen as a way to satisfy appreciation and affiliation motivations, and less likely to satisfy other motivations. Seven factors constrained outdoor recreation: (a) costs/regulations/crowding, (b) discomfort/dislike, (c) concerns about safety or discrimination, (d) planning required, (e) physical ability, (0 access, and (g) family/work commitments. Family/work commitments and cost most limited outdoor recreation. Constraints related to family/work commitments, cost, and lack of interest most limited fishing participation. We examined how perceived benefits and constraints predicted intention to fish. About 55% of respondents indicated that they would likely fish in the future, and about 50% of respondents said that they would likely fish in Minnesota in the next year. Appreciation, affiliation, and health motivations and constraints related to discomfort, discrimination/safety, and physical ability predicted future fishing. About 27% of respondents indicated that fishing was a "favorite" activity. Appreciation, comfort, and reduced access to angling opportunities predicted whether fishing was a favorite activity. We suggest that managers emphasize the multiple benefits of fishing including nature appreciation, social connection, and stress reduction, and develop programs and facilities to address discomfort and discrimination associated with fishing.

Animal Behaviour		2007	NOV 2007	74	Part 5	1493-1503	1493	1503	English						Studies of interference competition among foraging animals generally assume that variation in the spatial distribution of food can be neglected. This assumption may be problematic as resource defence experiments suggest that such variation is of the essence in some interference mechanisms. Interpretation of the results of field experiments on this topic, however, is hard because most studies used univariate statistics to analyse multivariate data. Because in free-living foragers interference and patch selection are connected behaviours, treatment effects on these responses are best studied simultaneously, through multivariate analyses. We performed a field experiment in which we provided wild ruddy turnstones, Arenaria interpres, with experimental plots that varied in the distance between a fixed number of so-called food pits, and, using multivariate statistics, we studied effects on the combination of the turnstones' behaviour and abundance. We found that when food pits were more spaced out, turnstones were present in higher numbers, while interacting less with each other. Nevertheless, turnstones spent about the same amount of time digging for food, our measure of intake rate, at each interpit distance. These findings imply that to reliably predict the combination of the number, intake rate and aggression of turnstones, the spatial distribution of food has to be known. We would not have reached this conclusion if we had used univariate statistics.

Whereas traditional epidemiological models typically assume no social structure, network theory suggests that an individual's location in the network determines its risk of infection. Empirical, especially experimental, studies of disease spread on networks are lacking, however, largely due to a shortage of amenable study systems. We used automated video-tracking to quantify networks of physical contact among individuals within colonies of the social bumble bee Bombus impatiens. We explored the effects of network structure on pathogen transmission in naturally and artificially infected hives. We show for the first time that contact network structure determines the spread of a contagious pathogen (Crithidia bombi) in social insect colonies. Differences in rates of infection among colonies resulted largely from differences in network density among hives. Within colonies, a bee's rate of contact with infected nestmates emerged as the only significant predictor of infection risk. The activity of bees, in terms of their movement rates and division of labour (e.g., brood care, nest care, foraging), did not influence risk of infection. Our results suggest that contact networks may have an important influence on the transmission of pathogens in social insects and, possibly, other social animals.

In this paper, we describe in a quantitative manner the maturation of behavioral patterns. Early movements are locally restricted "twitches" of the body wall, involving single segments or parts of segments. These twitches occur at a low frequency and have low amplitude, reflecting weak muscle contractions. Towards later stages twitches increase in frequency and amplitude and become integrated into coordinated movements of multiple segments. Most noticeable among these is the peristaltic wave of longitudinal segmental contractions by which the larva moves forward or backward. Besides becoming more complex as development proceeds, embryonic movements also acquire a pronounced rhythm. Thus, late embryonic movements occur in bursts, with phases of frequent movement separated by phases of no movement at all; early movements show no such periodicity. These data will serve as a baseline for future studies that address the function of embryonic lethal genes controlling neuronal connectivity and larval behavior. We have analyzed behavioral abnormalities in two embryonic lethal mutations with severe neural defects, tailless (tll) which lacks the protocerebrum, and glial cells missing (gcm), in which glial cells are absent. Our results reveal prominent alterations in embryonic motility for both of these mutations, indicating that the protocerebrum and glial cells play a crucial role in the neural mechanism controlling larval movement in Drosophila.

Developmental Neurobiology		2007	SEP 15 2007	67	11	1407-1418	1407	1418	English						In some songbirds perturbing auditory feedback can promote changes in song structure well beyond the end of song learning. One factor that may drive vocal change in such deafened birds is the ongoing addition of new vocal-motor neurons into the song system. Without auditory feedback to guide their incorporation, the addition of these new neurons could disrupt the established song pattern. To assess this hypothesis, the authors determined if neuronal recruitment into the vocal motor nucleus HVC is affected by neural signals that influence vocal change in adult deafened birds. Such signals appear to be conveyed via LMAN, a nucleus in the anterior forebrain that is necessary for vocal change after deafening. Here the authors tested whether LMAN lesions might restrict song degradation after deafening by reducing the addition or survival of new HVC neurons that would otherwise corrupt the ongoing song pattern. Using [3 H]thymidine autoradiography to identify neurons generated in adult zebra finches, it was shown here that LMAN lesions do not reduce the number or percent of new HVC neurons surviving for either several weeks or months after [3 H]thymidine labeling. However, the authors confirmed previous reports that LMAN lesions restrict vocal change after deafening. These data suggest that neurons incorporated into the adult HVC may form behaviorally adaptive connections without requiring auditory feedback, and that any role such neurons may play in promoting vocal change after adult deafening requires anterior forebrain pathway output.

Insectes Sociaux		2007	AUG 2007	54	3	225-233	225	233	English						Complex recognition systems underlie the social organization of many organisms. In social insects the acceptance of other individuals as nestmates can involve a variety of different cues, but the relative importance of these cues can change in relation to the fitness costs of accepting or rejecting other individuals. In this study we investigate the mechanisms that underlie recognition behaviour in Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). Introduced populations of Argentine ants are characterized by a social structure known as unicoloniality where intraspecific aggression is absent over large distances resulting in the formation of expansive supercolonies. Recent research has identified sites where multiple, mutually aggressive supercolonies co-occur allowing an examination of Argentine ant behaviour at territorial boundaries. We found that workers from different supercolonies always interact aggressively with one another, but that neighbours from different colonies (i.e., workers from nests located in the immediate vicinity of territory borders) consistently exhibited higher levels of aggression compared to those displayed by non-neighbours from different colonies (i.e., workers from nests located far enough away from a territory border so that interactions are unlikely). This difference in the level of aggression displayed between neighbours and between non-neighbours from different supercolonies cannot be explained by differences in relatedness or genetic similarity. Instead our findings suggest that direct contact between mutually antagonistic colonies is sufficient to elevate aggression. A laboratory experiment in which we manipulated the extent to which colonies with no prior history of contact could interact with one another, revealed that aggression increased after colonies were permitted to interact, but dropped after connections between colonies were severed. Moreover, the mere presence of an aggressive supercolony was sufficient to elicit elevated aggression. Overall these patterns are opposite to the "dear enemy" phenomenon and could be the result of the intense territorial aggression exhibited by established supercolonies of this species.	Thomas, M.

Although Antp expression repressed hth as predicted, contrary to expectations, hth did not show increased repression at higher Antp doses, whereas salm, a gene downstream of hth, did show such a dose response. Loss of hth allowed antenna-to-leg transformations but the relative timing of proximal-distal transformations was reversed, relative to transformations induced by ectopic Antp. Finally, overexpression of Hth was only partially able to rescue transformations induced by ectopic Amp. These results indicate that there may be additional molecules involved in antenna/leg identity and that spatial, temporal and dosage relationships are more subtle than suspected and must be part of a robust understanding of molecular network behaviour involved in determining appendage identity in Drosophila melanogaster.

Tree shrew optic nerves, aged 4 weeks to 5 years, were wax or cryoembedded for analysis of overall morphology and cellular (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and extracellular matrix (Collagen types I, III, IV, V, VI; fibronectin; and elastin) immunolocalization studies. In addition, transmission and scanning electron microscopy were performed. In vivo optic disc imaging was performed by HRT2 and fundus camera photography.RESULTS. The optic nerve of the tree shrew comprised regions comparable to the human prelaminar and lamina cribrosa (LC) in the optic nerve head and the retrolaminar region, immediately posterior. The multilayered connective tissue plates of tree shrew LC stretched across the optic nerve canal at the level of the sclera and consisted of collagen types I, III, IV, V, and VI; elastin; and fibronectin. Significant age-related alterations in connective tissue components were indicated. Connective tissue was present in the central retinal vessel sheaths and was identified as longitudinally oriented Collagen fibrils in the retrolaminar optic nerve. GFAP immunofluorescence indicated a high concentration of astrocytic processes in the LC. Myelination of axons was evident in the retrolaminar optic nerve. Ultrastructural studies supponed the structural organization and spatial distribution of connective tissue.CONCLUSIONS. In contrast to many rodent models of glaucoma, since the tree shrew optic nerve resembles that in humans, especially at the LC, the tree shrew offers an ideal opportunity to investigate glaucoma pathophysiology in a subprimate model.

In the designs, selections are made sequentially with a mixture distribution based on an active set that changes as the sampling progresses, using network or spatial relationships as well as sample values. The new designs have certain advantages compared with previously existing adaptive and link-tracing designs, including control over sample sizes and of the proportion of effort allocated to adaptive selections. Efficient inference involves averaging over sample paths consistent with the minimal sufficient statistic. A Markov chain resampling method makes the inference computationally feasible. The designs are evaluated in network and spatial settings using two empirical populations: a hidden human population at high risk for HIV/AIDS and an unevenly distributed bird population.

Drawing upon examples in the literature and from our experience, we developed conceptual models and used simple bivariate plots to visualize human impacts and restoration efforts in terms of connectivity and flow dynamics. Human-induced changes in longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity are often accompanied by changes in flow dynamics, but in our experience restoration efforts to date have more often restored connectivity than flow dynamics. Restoration actions have included removing dams to restore fish passage, reconnecting flow through artificially cut-off side channels, setting back or breaching levees, and removing fine sediment deposits that block vertical exchange with the bed, thereby partially restoring hydrologic connectivity, i.e., longitudinal, lateral, or vertical. Restorations have less commonly affected flow dynamics, presumably because of the social and economic importance of water diversions or flood control. Thus, as illustrated in these bivariate plots, the trajectories of ecological restoration are rarely parallel with degradation trajectories because restoration is politically and economically easier along some axes more than others.

However, deliberate and open communication cannot adequately address silent conflict. This begs two questions. First, how is the existence of covert communication and silent conflict to be recognized and addressed? Second, how are the wider social relations and traditions that encompass communication and conflict to be described and explained? These questions revolve around communicative power. Communication of environmental knowledge is deeply embedded in social power structures, with direct implications for participatory resource planning and implementation. Ethnographic research conducted at a failed community-managed fish farming project in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia shows that a culture of harmony and respect for authority can silence environmental conflict in the hierarchical "community." Three propositions are offered. First, communication amnesia and exclusion jeopardize participation. Second, cultures of harmony and silent conflict shape planning processes and outcomes. Third, the weak use manipulation and communication strategy to acquire a "voice" while preserving harmony. These propositions address five unresolved issues in participatory resource management: analysis of groups, contextuality, social relationships, nonparticipants, and informal communication. Power, tradition, and social networks affect the valuing of knowledge relative to the power of different individuals and institutions to communicate priorities, values, and needs. These factors are critical to the inclusion of both participants and nonparticipants.

Theory predicts that natural selection should favour females that are able to correctly assess the risk of predation and then use that information to avoid high-risk oviposition sites to reduce the risk of offspring predation. Despite the potential significance of such behaviour on individual fitness, population dynamics and community structure, relatively few studies of oviposition behaviour connected to the risk of predation have been carried out.2. However, some recent studies suggest that oviposition site selection in response to risk of predation may be a common phenomenon, at least among amphibians and mosquitoes. A vast majority of previous studies have, however, neglected to investigate how the offspring are affected, in terms of fitness related parameters, by the maternal oviposition site choice.3. In an outdoor artificial pond experiment we tested the oviposition site selection of female aquatic beetles (Hydroporus spp.) in relation to the presence or absence of a predatory fish (Perca fluviatilis). In addition, we monitored how the oviposition site selection affected the behaviour, growth and food resource of the progeny.4. We show that free-flying females of the aquatic beetles Hydroporus incognitus and H. nigrita prefer to oviposit in waters without fish compared with waters with fish. Larval activity of Hydroporus spp. was unaffected by fish presence. Our results indicate that beetle larvae from females that do lay eggs in waters with fish show increased growth compared with larvae in waters without fish. We explain this difference in growth by a higher per-capita food supply in the presence of a fish predator. This finding may have important implications for our understanding of how the variance of oviposition site selection in a population is sustained.

Neuronal networks, which contribute to these processes, have been extensively characterized on various levels of analysis, and imaging techniques allow monitoring of both gross brain activity as well as functional changes in defined brain areas during the time course of memory formation. New techniques developed in honeybees and fruit flies even allow for manipulation of neuronal networks and molecular cascades in a short temporal domain while a living animal under observation acquires new associative memories. These advantages make honeybees and flies ideal organisms to study transient molecular events underlying dynamic memory processing in vivo. In this review we will focus on the temporal features of molecular processes in learning and memory formation, summarize recent knowledge and present an outlook on future developments.

(r-ismagilov@uchicago.edu)									Lab on a Chip		2006	FEB 2006	6	2	185-190	185	190	English						This paper characterizes a microfluidic platform that differentially controls the temperature of each half of a living Drosophila melanogaster fruitfly embryo in space and time (E. M. Lucchetta, J. H. Lee, L. A. Fu, N. H. Patel and R. F. Ismagilov, Nature, 2005, 434, 1134-1138). This platform relies on laminar flow of two streams of liquid with different temperature, and on rapid prototyping in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Here, we characterized fluid flow and heat transport in this platform both experimentally and by numerical simulation, and estimated the temperature distribution around and within the embryo by numerical simulation, to identify the conditions for creating a sharper temperature difference (temperature step) over the embryo. Embryos were removed from the device and immunostained histochemically for detection of Paired protein. Biochemical processes are sensitive to small differences in environmental temperature. The microfluidic platform characterized here could prove useful in understanding dynamics of biochemical networks as they respond to changes in temperature.

(fwhite@mit.edu)									Molecular Systems Biology		2006		2		Article No.: 54	54		English						Although human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression is implicated in tumor progression for a variety of cancer types, how it dysregulates signaling networks governing cell behavioral functions is poorly understood. To address this problem, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to analyze dynamic effects of HER2 overexpression on phosphotyrosine signaling in human mammary epithelial cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or heregulin (HRG). Data generated from this analysis reveal that EGF stimulation of HER2-overexpressing cells activates multiple signaling pathways to stimulate migration, whereas HRG stimulation of these cells results in amplification of a specific subset of the migration signaling network. Self-organizing map analysis of the phosphoproteomic data set permitted elucidation of network modules differentially regulated in HER2-overexpressing cells in comparison with parental cells for EGF and HRG treatment. Partial least-squares regression analysis of the same data set identified quantitative combinations of signals within the networks that strongly correlate with cell proliferation and migration measured under the same battery of conditions. Combining these modeling approaches enabled association of epidermal growth factor receptor family dimerization to activation of specific phosphorylation sites, which appear to most critically regulate proliferation and/or migration.

Wetlands		2005	DEC 2005	25	4	821-831	821	831	English						About 190,000 ha of higher-elevation marl prairies flank either side of Shark River Slough in the southern Everglades. Water levels typically drop below the ground surface each year in this landscape. Consequently, peat soil accretion is inhibited, and substrates consist either of calcitic marl produced by algal periphyton mats or exposed limestone bedrock. The southern marl prairies support complex mosaics of wet prairie, sawgrass sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), tree islands, and tropical hammock communities and a high diversity of plant species. However, relatively short hydroperiods and annual dry downs provide stressful conditions for aquatic fauna, affecting survival in the dry season when surface water is absent. Here, we present a conceptual ecological model developed for this landscape through scientific concensus, use of empirical data, and modeling. The two major societal drivers affecting the southern marl prairies are water management practices and agricultural and urban development. These drivers lead to five groups of ecosystem stressors: loss of spatial extent and connectivity, shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity, extended hydroperiod and drying pattern reversals, introduction and spread of non-native trees, and introduction and spread of non-native fishes. Major ecological attributes include periphyton mats, plant species diversity and community mosaic, Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna prey base, American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), and wading bird early dry season foraging. Water management and development are hypothesized to have a negative effect on the ecological attributes of the southern marl prairies in the following ways. Periphyton mats have decreased in cover in areas where hydroperiod has been significantly reduced and changed in community composition due to inverse responses to increased nutrient availability. Plant species diversity and community mosaics have changed due to shifting gradients to more terrestrial or more aquatic communities, displacement of native communities by non-natives, expansion of woody plants, high-intensity dry season fires, tree-island burnout, and reduced microtopography resulting from alligator population decline. Cape Sable seaside sparrow populations are threatened by nest destruction resulting from extended hydroperiods, drying pattern reversals, and high intensity dry season fires, as well as by the expansion of woody plants into graminoid wetland habitats. Populations of marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna that constitute the aquatic prey base for higher vertebrates have decreased in density and changed in species composition and size structure due to loss of wetland spatial extent, shortened hydroperiod, increased drought severity, loss of aquatic drought refugia in solution holes and alligator holes, and spread of exotic fishes. American alligator populations have declined in the Rocky Glades, and alligator holes have filled with sediment, as a result of shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity. Habitat options for wading birds to forage during the early dry season and during unusually wet years have been reduced due to loss of spatial extent and shortened hydroperiod.

The fact that all living primates typically live in social networks makes it highly likely that the last common ancestor of living primates already lived in social networks, and that sociality formed an integral part of the adaptive nature of primate origins. A characterization of primate sociality within the wider mammalian context is therefore essential to further our understanding of the adaptive nature of primate origins. Here we determine correlates of sociality and nonsociality in rodents as a model to infer causes of sociality in primates. We found sociality to be most strongly associated with large-bodied arboreal species that include a significant portion of fruit in their diet. Fruits and other plant products, such as flowers, seeds, and young leaves, are patchily distributed in time and space and are therefore difficult to find. These food resources are, however, predictable and dependable when their location is known. Hence, membership in a social unit can maximize food exploitation if information on feeding sites is shared. Whether sociality evolved in the primate stem lineage or whether it was already present earlier in the evolution of Euarchontoglires remains uncertain, although tentative evidence points to the former scenario. In either case, frugivory is likely to have played an important role in maintaining the presence of a social lifestyle throughout primate evolution.

The dingy skipper butterfly (Erynnis tages) is a regionally rare declining species in Britain. In the Creuddyn Peninsula (North Wales), it inhabits patches of its host plant, Lotus corniculatus L., growing in lightly grazed areas in sheltered microhabitats, and its regional distribution is dominated by metapopulation processes. In this area, 16 (61%) out of 2620 ha of dingy skipper habitat are located in reserves. The remaining unprotected habitat is mostly located in wasteland areas vulnerable to urban development Using a metapopulation model, the incidence function model, I evaluated the extent to which the persistence of the dingy skipper in the landscape could be guaranteed with the existing reserve network. According to model projections, the dynamics within the reserve system were relatively stable when the unprotected habitat remained, with a maximum of 4% simulation replicates going extinct in a 100-year time frame. When unprotected habitat was completely removed, however, the dynamics in the reserve network became markedly unstable, with an increased extinction risk ranging from 15 to 36%. We calculated a relatively simple measure of "patch importance, " the colonization potential, for each patch. The incidence function model predicted that for low and medium levels of regional stochasticity (a value from 0 to 0.2), protecting only a relatively small number (four to six) of large and well-connected patches (high colonization potential) in addition to the existing reserves would be enough to decrease notably the extinction risk of the dingy skipper metapopulation. The number of patches needed to be increased (11 patches) for high levels of regional stochasticity (sigma = 0.3). My results suggest that long-term persistence of a regionally rare butterfly in a reserve network may depend on the presence of unprotected habitat. For a more realistic estimate of the efficiency of,reserves for protecting rare species, conservation biologists should consider incorporating metapopulation dynamics in their evaluations of persistence in existing reserves.

(i.m.stanford@aston.ac.uk)									Journal of Physiology (Oxford)		2005	SEP 15 2005	567	3	977-987	977	987	English						In accordance with its central role in basal ganglia circuitry, changes in the rate of action potential firing and pattern of activity in the globus pallidus (GP)-subthalamic nucleus (STN) network are apparent in movement disorders. In this study we have developed a mouse brain slice preparation that maintains the functional connectivity between the GP and STN in order to assess its role in shaping and modulating bursting activity promoted by pharmacological manipulations. Fibre-tract tracing studies indicated that a parasagittal slice cut 20 deg to the midline best preserved connectivity between the GP and the STN. IPSCs and EPSCs elicited by electrical stimulation confirmed connectivity from GP to STN in 44/59 slices and from STN to GP in 22/33 slices, respectively. In control slices, 74/76 (97%) of STN cells fired tonically at a rate of 10.3 +/- 1.3Hz. This rate and pattern of single spiking activity was unaffected by bath application of the GABA(A) antagonist picrotoxin (50 mu m, n = 9) or the glutamate receptor antagonist (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2, 3-dione (CNQX) 10 mu m, n = 8). Bursting activity in STN neurones could be induced pharmacologically by application of NMDA alone (20 mu m, 3/18 cells, 17%) but was more robust if NMDA was applied in conjunction with apamin (20-100 nM, 34/77 cells, 44%). Once again, neither picrotoxin (50 mu m, n = 5) nor CNQX (10 mu m, n = 5) had any effect on the frequency or pattern of the STN neurone activity while paired STN and GP recordings of tonic and bursting activity show no evidence of coherent activity. Thus, in a mouse brain slice preparation where functional GP-STN connectivity is preserved, no regenerative synaptically mediated activity indicative of a dynamic network is evident, either in the resting state or when. neuronal bursting in both the GP and STN is generated by application of NMDA/apamin. This difference from the brain in Parkinson's disease may be attributed either to insufficient preservation of cortico-striato-pallidal or cortico-subthalamic circuitry, and/or an essential requirement for adaptive changes resulting from dopamine depletion for the expression of network activity within this tissue complex.

(fedigan@ucalgary.ca)									American Journal of Physical Anthropology		2005	AUG 2005	127	4	481-491	481	491	English						Interpopulation variability in patterns of food processing, similar to what is described as "traditional" or "cultural" variation in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), was identified in white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus). However, recent comparisons of food processing in capuchins were conducted only at the population level, with relatively little attention given to variability among groups, age/sex classes, or individuals. This paper examines variability in the processing of specific food types within the context of various social networks (i.e., patterns of association, rank, and kinship) among free-ranging Cebus capucinus at Santa Rosa National Park in Costa Rica. We collected data on two groups of white-faced capuchins in 2001, identifying rates of "food interest" for each individual, as well as forms of processing for specific food types. Juveniles exhibited the most interest in the food-processing behavior of other group members, and food interest was directed most frequently toward adult females. We identified distinctive processing techniques for several food items (Luehea candida pods, Sloanea terniflora fruits, and caterpillars) that facilitated comparisons among individuals within groups. Food-processing techniques for Sloanea fruit and caterpillars appeared to vary independently of the social networks examined in this study. However, we found evidence that variation in Luehea candida processing is to some degree linked to both patterns of association and social rank. The potential influence of these variables on observed food processing patterns warrants further scrutiny. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Fear learning is reflected in a change of autonomic and somatic responses, such as heart rate and freezing, elicited by a neutral stimulus that has been previously paired with a painful one. Manipulation of the vermis affects these responses, and its reversible inactivation during the consolidation period impairs fear memory. The neural correlate of cerebellar involvement in fear consolidation is provided by a behaviorally induced long-term increase of synaptic efficacy between parallel fibers and a Purkinje cell. Similar synaptic changes after fear conditioning are well documented in the amygdala and hippocampus, providing a link between emotional experiences and changes in neural activity. In addition, in hotfoot mice, with a primary deficiency of parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapse, short- and long-term fear memories are affected. All these data support the idea that the cerebellum participates in fear learning. The functional interconnection of the vermis with hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus suggests a more complex role of the cerebellum as part of an integrated network regulating emotional behavior.

(carla.grashof@wur.nl) ; van Langevelde, Frank									Landscape Ecology		2005	MAY 2005	20	4	417-439	417	439	English						Many semi-natural landscape elements, the so-called green veining, are disappearing from the intensively used agricultural landscapes of Europe. In order to develop or restore biodiversity in these networks, it is necessary to quantify the relation between biodiversity and amount, spatial arrangement and management intensity of green veining elements. In this review, we investigate whether biodiversity increases with the amount of green veining in an agricultural landscape following the species-area relationship, and whether a certain level of biodiversity can be reached at lower densities of green veining if green veining elements are better connected (higher spatial connectivity) or if they are managed less intensively (lower management intensity). We reviewed studies on aboveground biodiversity in green veining structures in 39 scientific papers on field and experimental studies within Europe. More of these studies focussed on management intensity than on amount or spatial configuration of green veining. Also more studies focussed on the spatial scale of individual landscape elements than on the farm or landscape scale, which may be caused by the large number of studies focussing on plant or invertebrate species. Species living at larger spatial scales, e.g. mammals and birds were not often studied at the level of green veining elements as they also use agricultural fields as part of their habitat. We could not verify the species-area relation for green veining, nor the effect of amount, spatial configuration or management intensity on this relation, because only few studies quantified the found effects and no studies were found on the effect of management intensity or spatial configuration on the species-area curve in green veining. We addressed the most important challenges for future field and model research in order to fill the identified gaps in knowledge.

Profound heterogeneity at clinical and neuropathological levels suggests distinct subpopulations of SLE patients and multiple mechanisms in the pathogenesis of aberrant behavior. Using inbred mice prone to SLE-like condition, we presently examine whether subpopulations of diseased mice can be identified on the basis of their behavioral performance.Methods: Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to classify 105 MRL-lpr males into clusters. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and discriminant function analysis were used to detect overall differences and identify discriminative variables.Results: Cluster 1 was characterized by blunted responsiveness to palatable stimulation, as well as increased spleen mass and serum levels of interleukin-1. Cluster 2 comprised of animals with reduced ambulation speed and enlarged spleen. Mice from cluster 3 showed profound dilatation of brain ventricles, reduced brain mass, impaired nutrition and performance in task reflective of emotional reactivity.Conclusions: Present results suggest that systemic autoimmunity compromises brain function via non-Mendelian mechanisms. Although neuroactive cytokines may impair reward systems, brain atrophy seems to underlie deficits in ingestive behavior and emotional reactivity. This study supports the hypothesis that multiple neuroimmunological pathways are involved in the etiology Of aberrant behavior during SLE-like disease.

To our knowledge this is the first study to provide replication of social networks and therefore probably the first that allows general conclusions to be drawn. The social networks were all found to have a non-random structure and exhibited 'social cliquishness'. A number of factors were observed to contribute to this structuring. Firstly, social network structure was influenced by body length and shoaling tendency, with individuals interacting more frequently with conspecifics of similar body length and shoaling tendency. Secondly, individuals with many social contacts were found to interact with each other more often than with other conspecifics, a phenomenon known as a 'positive degree correlation'. Finally, repeated interactions between pairs of individuals occurred within the networks more often than expected by random interactions. The observed network structures will have ecological and evolutionary implications. For example, the occurrence of positive degree correlations suggests the possibility that pathogens and information (that are socially transmitted) could spread very fast within the populations. Furthermore, the occurrence of repeated interactions between pairs of individuals fulfils an important pre-requisite for the evolution of reciprocal altruism.	Croft, D.

For example, in the Drosophila embryo, maternal morphogen gradients establish gap gene expression domain patterning along the anterior-posterior axis, through linkage with an elaborate gene network. To understand the evolution and behaviour of such systems better, it is important to establish the minimal determinants required for patterning. We have therefore engineered artificial transcription-translation networks that generate simple patterns, crudely analogous to the Drosophila gap gene system. The Drosophila syncytium was modelled using DNA-coated paramagnetic beads fixed by magnets in an artificial chamber, forming a gene expression network. Transient expression domain patterns were generated using various levels of network connectivity. Generally, adding more transcription repression interactions increased the "sharpness'' of the pattern while reducing overall expression levels. An accompanying computer model for our system allowed us to search for parameter sets compatible with patterning. While it is clear that the Drosophila embryo is far more complex than our simplified model, several features of interest emerge. For example, the model suggests that simple diffusion may be too rapid for Drosophila-scale patterning, implying that sublocalisation, or "trapping,'' is required. Second, we find that for pattern formation to occur under the conditions of our in vitro reaction-diffusion system, the activator molecules must propagate faster than the inhibitors. Third, adding controlled protease degradation to the system stabilizes pattern formation over time. We have reconstituted transcriptional pattern formation from purified substances, including phage RNA polymerases, ribonucleotides, and an eukaryotic translation extract. We anticipate that the system described here will be generally applicable to the study of any biological network with a spatial component.

During the early development, it behaves first as an inhibitor and later as an activator of translation. In mammals, its closest homologue is CPEB1 for which two isoforms, short and long, have been described. Here we describe an additional isoform with a different RNA recognition motif, which is differentially expressed in the brain and ovary. We show that all CPEB1 isoforms are found associated with two previously described cytoplasmic structures, stress granules and dcp1 bodies. This association requires the RNA binding ability of the protein, whereas the Aurora A phosphorylation site is dispensable. Interestingly, the rck/p54 DEAD box protein, which is known as a CPEB partner in Xenopus and clam, and as a component of dcp1 bodies in mammals, is also present in stress granules. Both stress granules and dcp1 bodies are involved in mRNA storage and/or degradation, although so far no link has been made between the two, in terms of neither morphology nor protein content. Here we show that transient CPEB1 expression induces the assembly of stress granules, which in turn recruit dcp1 bodies. This dynamic connection between the two structures sheds new light on the compartmentalization of mRNA metabolism in the cytoplasm.

Our technique requires isolating a colony's adult bee population in a detachable box prior to powdered sugar application. We designed a detachable 'bee box' that connects to the colony's entrance and is capable of holding the adult bee population. By applying a bee repellent, Bee Go (R), to a colony, we forced adult bees into the bee box where they were subsequently dusted with 225 g of powdered sugar. Adult honey bee populations treated in this manner dropped 76.7 +/- 3.6% (n = 28) of their mites.

(mscooper@u.washington.edu)									Zebrafish		2005		2	1	7-18	7	18	English						Similar to chick, mouse, and Xenopus, a number of intercellular signaling pathways are required for zebrafish segmentation. However, the spatial scales over which these signaling pathways operate in zebrafish remain largely unknown. During zebrafish segmentation, waves of her1 transcription (a) initiate within the tailbud region, (b) propagate anteriorly through presomitic mesoderm (PSM), and (c) terminate in the anlage of newly-forming somites. These observations raise the question of whether the tailbud region serves as a "pacemaker" or "organizing center" for the initiation of propagating her1 expression waves. Microsurgical manipulations reveal that the anteriorly waves of her1 transcription are not perturbed by removal of the zebrafish tailbud. Furthermore, expression patterns of deltaD, paraxial protocadherin C (papc), and myoD within recently formed somites also appear to be relatively unperturbed by either removal of the tailbud, or by removal of lateral plate mesoderm. Although dynamic gene networks rapidly specify mesenchymal or epithelial cellular identities within forming somites, this specification is plastic. Time-lapse analysis has shown that the cellular progeny of mitotically-active epithelial border cells within newly formed somites can adopt different cellular identities than their precursor cells. Overall, these results indicate that sustained long-range intercellular communication with the tailbud, anterior somites, or lateral plate mesoderm is not necessary for segmentation or somitogenesis to proceed within the PSM. The basic segmentation and somitogenesis processes in zebrafish presomitic mesoderm appear to be largely regionally autonomous and governed by local morphogenetic cell behaviors.

(Carolyn.Price@uc.edu)									Molecular and Cellular Biology		2004	November 2004	24	22	9802-9812	9802	9812	English	print					Tankyrases are novel poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases that have SAM and ankyrin protein-interaction domains. They are found at telomeres, centrosomes, nuclear pores, and Golgi vesicles and have been shown to participate in telomere length regulation. Their other function(s) are unknown, and it has been difficult to envision a common role at such diverse cellular locations. We have shown that tankyrase I polymerizes through its sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain to assemble large protein complexes. In vitro polymerization is reversible and still allows interaction with ankyrin-domain binding proteins. Polymerization can also occur in vivo, with SAM-dependent association of overexpressed tankyrase leading to formation of large tankyrase-containing vesicles, disruption of Golgi structure, and inhibition of apical secretion. Finally, tankyrase polymers are dissociated efficiently by poly(ADP-ribosy)lation. This disassembly is prevented by mutation of the PARP domain. Our findings indicate that tankyrase 1 has the unique capacity to promote both assembly and disassembly of large protein complexes. Thus, tankyrases appear to be master scaffolding proteins that regulate the formation of dynamic protein networks at different cellular locations. This implies a common scaffolding function for tankyrases at each location, with specific tankyrase interaction partners conferring location-specific roles to each network e.g., telomere compaction or regulation of vesicle trafficking.

Home to vast numbers of waterfowls, fish, and plants, the SSP is globally significant for biodiversity conservation. The loss and fragmentation of wetlands as a result agricultural development over 50 years has impacted wetland communities and their biodiversity. We used GIS to inventory large-scale land-use changes from 1950 to 2000, together with other statistical data. We found that 73.6% of the wetlands were lost due to agricultural development. Consequences of these land-use changes included: i) a rapid decline in waterfowl and plant species with the loss and fragmentation of natural wetlands and wetland ecosystem degradation; ii) greater variation in wetland water levels as the result of land-use changes over the years; N) disruption of the dynamic river-floodplain connection by construction of drainage ditches and levees; and iv) a decrease in floodplain area that caused increased flooding peak flows and runoff. Here we show how these changes affect wetland biodiversity and impact important wetland species.

The effects of conversion degree on the formation of free fatty acids and diacyglycerols, solid fat content, crystallization behavior, microstructure, and crystal network were investigated, and the enzymatically interesterified products were compared with a chemically interesterified product. Formation of free fatty acids and diacyglycerols increased slightly with increasing conversion degree. The solid fat content was higher at 10 and 20degreeC and lower at 30, 35, and 40degreeC with increasing conversion degree. Increased conversion degree from the blend to products, measured by X-ray with addition of 50% of rapeseed oil for dilution, caused the content of beta to decrease from 100% to 33%, and 30% and eventually to pure beta' crystal. However, double chain packing was observed for both the blend and products. Isothermal crystallization kinetics was characterized by the Fisher-Turnbull model. The highest free energy was observed for the blend. A small deformation with oscillation tests shows a significant difference between the blend and interesterified products. The differences of microstructure between the blend, different conversion degree, and chemical randomized product were observed.

Biotechnology and Bioengineering		2004	May 5, 2004	86	3	277-290	277	290	English	print					The state-of-the-art understanding of activated sludge processes as summarized in activated sludge models (ASMs) predicts an instantaneous increase in the biomass activity (which is measured, e.g., by the corresponding respiration rate OUR, NUR, etc.) under sudden substrate concentration changes. Experimental data (e.g., short-term batch respiration experiments under aerobic or anoxic conditions) collected for the calibration of the dynamic models (ASMs) often exhibit a transient phenomenon while attaining maximum activity, which cannot be explained by the current understanding of the activated sludge process. That transient phenomenon exhibits itself immediately upon addition of a substrate source to an endogenously respiring activated sludge sample and it usually takes a few minutes until the activated sludge reaches its maximum possible rate under given environmental conditions. This discrepancy between the state-of-the-art model and the experimental data is addressed in detail in this investigation. It is shown that the discrepancy is not caused by an error in the experimental set-up/data but it is rather due to model inadequacy. Among the hypotheses proposed, it appears that this transient response of the activated sludge most likely results from the sequence of intracellular reactions involved in substrate degradation by the activated sludge. Results from studies performed elsewhere with pure cultures (S. cerevisae and E. coli) support the hypothesis. The transient phenomenon can be described by a dynamic metabolic network model or by a simple first-order model, as adopted in this study. The transient phenomenon occurring in short-term batch respiration experiments is shown to interfere severely with parameter estimation if not modeled properly (2.8%, 11.5%, and 16.8% relative errors (average of three experiments) on YH, mumaxH, and KS, respectively). Proper modeling of this transient phenomenon whose time constant is on the order of minutes (1 to 3 min) is expected to contribute fundamentally to a better understanding and modeling of Orbal, carousel, and SBR-type treatment plants with fast-alternating process conditions, although such studies are beyond the scope of this report.

Haynes, Kyle J. (khayne4@lsu.edu) ; Cronin, James T.									Ecology (Washington D C)		2003	November 2003	84	11	2856-2866	2856	2866	English	print					To date, there is a lack of well-controlled field experiments that disentangle the effects of the intervening matrix from other landscape variables (e.g., patch geography or quality) that might influence animal dispersal among patches. We performed a field experiment to investigate how the movement of a delphacid planthopper (Prokelisia crocea) among discrete patches of prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata) is affected by the composition of the matrix (mudflat, native nonhost grasses, and the introduced grass smooth brome (Bromus inermis)). Within each matrix type, marked planthoppers were released onto experimental cordgrass patches that were made identical in size, isolation, and host plant quality. We found that the emigration rate (planthoppers lost per patch per day) was 1,3 times higher for patches embedded in the two nonhost grass matrix types than for patches in mudflat. The rate of immigration (immigrants per patch per day) into patches isolated by 3 m was 5.4 times higher in the brome than in the mudflat matrix. Patches in the native grass matrix had intermediate immigration rates. In addition, a survey of planthopper distributions in nature revealed that both the within- and among-patch distributions of the planthopper were related to the composition of the matrix. Within patches, individuals accumulated against mudflat edges (relative to patch interiors) but not against nonhost grass edges. Among patches, incidence and density increased with the proportion of the matrix composed of open mud. The matrix was equal to that of patch geography (size and isolation) in its ability to explain the distribution of the planthopper. We suggest that the low permeability of the mudflat relative to a nonhost grass edge may explain these planthopper distributional patterns. Also, because natural cordgrass patches in mudflat were richer in nutrients than those in nonhost grasses, planthoppers may have been more likely to remain and build up densities on the former patches. We predict that the displacement of native matrix types by invasive brome will result in increased connectivity and greater spatial synchrony in densities of planthoppers among cordgrass patches.

Zhang De-Xing (dxzhang@panda.ioz.ac.cn) ; Yan Lu-Na; Kang Le; Ji Ya-Jie									Acta Zoologica Sinica		2003	Oct. 2003	49	5	675-681	675	681	Chinese	print					The migratory locusts have perhaps been the most important agricultural pest in China since the earliest historical time. Traditionally, locust populations in China have been classified into three subspecies based mostly on morphological differences, viz: the oriental migratory locust (Locusta migratoria manilensis), the Asiatic migratory locust (Locusta migratoria migratoria) and the Tibetan migratory locust (Locusta migratoria tibetensis). Morphological characters (as well as other characters such as generation number) are, however, not always reliable particularly for widely distributed organisms such as Locusta, since they can be much affected by regional climatic and ecological variation in addition to genetic difference. Significant overlaps, for example, of morphometric values between locusts from different groups have well been observed. Also, the central area of the Huabei plain has been considered to be the ancestral area of the migratory locusts in China, in connection with the dynamics of river development and the formation of delta and alluvial fans. However, the impact of some major historical climatic events such as the last glaciation has not been considered in such analyses. Therefore, the validity of the aforementioned conclusions and opinions on the classification and population evolution of the migratory locusts in China are questionable and deserves further examination. Here we give our unorthodox views on these issues prompted by data from molecular population genetic study, and suggest some major revisions. This also implies that the migratory locusts have a great potential to colonize further north in North China following the global warming crisis, for it appears that the only limiting factor for their northward dispersal up to the latitude 46degreeN is winter temperature and not photoperiod or genetic background.

Amaral, D. G. (dgamaral@ucdavis.edu) ; Bauman, M. D.; Schumann, C. Mills									Genes Brain and Behavior		2003	October 2003	2	5	295-302	295	302	English	print					Brothers (1990) has proposed that the amygdala is an important component of the neural network that underlies social behavior. Kemper and Bauman (1993) identified neuropathology in the amygdala of the postmortem autistic brain. These findings, along with recent functional neuroimaging data, have led Baron-Cohen et al. (2000) to propose that dysfunction of the amygdala may be responsible, in part, for the impairment of social behavior that is a hallmark feature of autism. Recent data from studies in our laboratory on the effects of amygdala lesions in the adult and infant macaque monkey do not support a fundamental role for the amygdala in social behavior. If the amygdala is not essential for the component processes of social behavior, as seems to be case in both non-human primates and selected patients with bilateral amygdala damage, then it is unlikely to be the primary substrate for the impaired social behavior of autism. However, damage to the amygdala does have an effect on a monkey's response to normally fear-inducing stimuli, such as snakes, and removes a natural reluctance to engage novel conspecifics in social interactions. These findings lead to the conclusion that an important role for the amygdala is in the detection of threats and mobilizing an appropriate behavioral response, part of which is fear. Interestingly, an important comorbid feature of autism is anxiety (Muris et al, 1998). If the amygdala is pathological in subjects with autism, it may contribute to their abnormal fears and increased anxiety rather than their abnormal social behavior.	Amaral, D.

Physical, biological, and social systems interacted in complex ways to affect coastal communities. For this integrated case study, we examine linkages between atmospheric conditions (including the North Atlantic Oscillation), ocean circulation, ecosystem conditions, fishery activities, and the livelihoods and population changes of two West Greenland towns: Sisimiut, south of Disko Bay, and Paamiut, on the southwest coast. Sisimiut prospered as a fishing center through the cod-to-shrimp transition. Paamiut, more specialized in cod fishing, declined. Their stories suggest two general propositions about the human dimensions of climatic change. First, socially important environmental changes result not simply from climatic change, but from interactions between climate, ecosystem, and resource usage. Second, environmental changes affect people differentially and through interactions with social factors. Social networks and cohesion (social capital) are important, in addition to skills (human capital), investments (physical capital), and alternative resources (natural capital): all shape how the benefits and costs are distributed.

American Journal of Gastroenterology		2003	August 2003	98	8	1838-1843	1838	1843	English	print					OBJECTIVES: In the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), both increased visceral sensitivity and altered colonic motility seem to play a role. The aim of this study was to quantify the temporal relationship between pain episodes and the occurrence of high amplitude propagated pressure waves (HAPPWs). METHODS: A total of 11 IBS patients with the nonconstipation predominant pattern of IBS and 10 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers were studied. On day 1, a solid state manometric catheter was positioned in the left colon and connected to a data logger. The subjects then went home. Thereafter they pressed a button on the data logger at the beginning and end of each pain episode. The 24-h manometric signal recorded on day 2 was divided into consecutive 5-min periods. These periods were evaluated for the occurrence of pain and HAPPWs. Fisher's exact test was applied to calculate the probability that HAPPWs and pain episodes were unrelated. The symptom association probability (SAP) was calculated as (1.0-P)X100%. A SAP of >95% was considered to indicate that the observed association did not occur by chance. RESULTS: In four of seven patients with pain on day 2, the SAP was >95%. HAPPWs that were related to pain originated at a more proximal level (p=0.026) and occurred earlier (p=0.007) than HAPPWs that were not related to pain. The duration of a pain period was correlated with the number of pain-related HAPPWs in that period (r=0.906, p=0.013). Two of the 10 healthy subjects experienced pain, and these pain episodes were not associated with HAPPWs. CONCLUSION: Using objective analysis techniques, an association between pain episodes and HAPPWs was found in nonconstipated IBS patients with pain. HAPPWs that are associated with pain are only slightly different from HAPPWs not associated with pain.	Smout, A. J. P.

Drought is a natural disturbance of aquatic ecosystems and can be a major factor in structuring aquatic communities. For individuals, populations and communities to persist in disturbed environments, they must have refuge from disturbance or disturbance must be minimal. Refugia convey spatial and temporal resistance or resilience in the face of disturbance, but the role of refugia in aquatic systems remains poorly understood. 2. We review available literature on aquatic refugia for fishes in order to synthesise current knowledge and provide suggestions for needed research. Our objectives were to clarify definitions of disturbance and refugia in the context of drought in aquatic systems, review how refuge habitats influence fish community structure, and consider the potential impact of refugia on fish population and community dynamics during drought. 3. Droughts cause a decrease in surface area/volume and an increase in extremes of physical and chemical water quality parameters. These conditions are linked with biotic interactions that structure the community of fishes residing in low-flow or dry season refugia by increasing mortality rates, decreasing birth rates and/or increasing migration rates. Many aquatic organisms seek refuge from disturbance and/or have adaptations (e.g. physiological tolerance) that provide refuge. 4. Drought in aquatic systems leads to shifts in refugia spacing and connectance at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Refuge size, disturbance intensity, and mobility of organisms is predicted to play a large role in population persistence. We expect that refuge habitats will experience net immigration during drying and net emigration after rewetting, with the opposite occurring in surrounding habitat patches. Population dynamics of fishes using refugia during drought are best modelled by modified source-sink dynamics, but dynamics are likely to change with spatial scale.

Using an innovative approach to identify interneuron inputs onto motorneuron populations in a neonatal rodent spinal cord preparation, we have investigated the network responsible for left-right coordination of the hindlimbs. We demonstrate how commissural interneurons (CINs), whose axons traverse the midline to innervate contralateral neurons, are organized such that distinct flexor and extensor centers in the rostral lumbar spinal cord define activity in both flexor and extensor caudal motor pools. In addition, the nature of some connections are reconfigured on switching from rest to locomotion via a mechanism that might be associated with synaptic plasticity in the spinal cord. These results from identified pattern-generating interneurons demonstrate how interneuron populations create an effective network to underlie behavior in mammals.

The results demonstrated that cardiac ganglia in all investigated species are embedded in epicardial fat. They formed plexo-ganglionic structures. Each of them composed of many ganglia (from seven up to 36) different in size and shape, and interconnected by fascicles of nerve fibres. Comparative analysis showed that the density of neural network and cell aggregations was different in individual species. The richest plexo-ganglionic structure was in pigeon. It was organized in three plexo-ganglia with an average of 30 ganglia. The largest one was located along the anterior interventricular sulcus. The cardiac ganglia of investigated mammals were localized mainly on the epicardium of atria; in Egyptian spiny mouse and chinchilla laniger on the ventral surface of right atrium, but in midday gerbil on the dorsal surface of left atrium. Moreover, in midday gerbil and Egyptian spiny mouse the little plexo-ganglionic structure on the ventricle were noticed. Additionally, in midday gerbil the single nerve cells might be observed between cardiac muscle of atria. It can be said that, the strongly developed cardiac plexus in pigeon is probably connected with his behaviour and functional properties of the heart. The arrangement of neurones in cardiac ganglia of all examined mammals was uniform over the whole surface of the sections, while in the pigeon, neurones were located mainly in the peripheral part of the ganglion.

Compte, Albert (acompte@umh.es) ; Sanchez-Vives, Maria V.; McCormick, David A.; Wang, Xiao-Jing									Journal of Neurophysiology (Bethesda)		2003	May 2003	89	5	2707-2725	2707	2725	English	print					Slow oscillatory activity (<1 Hz) is observed in vivo in the cortex during slow-wave sleep or under anesthesia and in vitro when the bath solution is chosen to more closely mimic cerebrospinal fluid. Here we present a biophysical network model for the slow oscillations observed in vitro that reproduces the single neuron behaviors and collective network firing patterns in control as well as under pharmacological manipulations. The membrane potential of a neuron oscillates slowly (at <1 Hz) between a down state and an up state; the up state is maintained by strong recurrent excitation balanced by inhibition, and the transition to the down state is due to a slow adaptation current (Na+-dependent K+ current). Consistent with in vivo data, the input resistance of a model neuron, on average, is the largest at the end of the down state and the smallest during the initial phase of the up state. An activity wave is initiated by spontaneous spike discharges in a minority of neurons, and propagates across the network at a speed of 3-8 mm/s in control and 20-50 mm/s with inhibition block. Our work suggests that long-range excitatory patchy connections contribute significantly to this wave propagation. Finally, we show with this model that various known physiological effects of neuromodulation can switch the network to tonic firing, thus simulating a transition to the waking state.

Jordano, Pedro (jordano@cica.es) ; Bascompte, Jordi; Olesen, Jens M.									Ecology Letters		2003	January 2003	6	1	69-81	69	81	English	print					Plant-animal mutualistic networks are interaction webs consisting of two sets of entities, plant and animal species, whose evolutionary dynamics are deeply influenced by the outcomes of the interactions, yielding a diverse array of coevolutionary processes. These networks are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant-pollinator and 24 plant-frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant-animal mutualistic networks (65.6%) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2%) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant-animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs.

The spike time shift as a function of the time of the perturbation is called Phase Reset Curve (PRC). PRCs can be either strictly positive (class I) or biphasic (class II). Theoretical analysis shows that spike generation dynamics determine the class of the PRC. Neurons with strong voltage-dependent spike frequency adaptation (SPA) currents should show type II PRCs, while non-adapting neurons fall under the type I spike-generating dynamics and yield class I PRCs. Blocking SPA can thus change the shape and the class of the PRC as well as spike-generating dynamics. We test the hypothesis that the shape and/or type of the PRC can be changed by cholinergic neuromodulation through its effects on SPA currents. To this end, we recorded from layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the slices of the mouse (P28 to P35) visual cortex. Via current injection trough the patch-pipette we depolarized the neurons above threshold and injected brief current pulses at random times during the inter-spike interval to determine the phase-reset curve. This was repeated after bath application of 20lM of the cholinergic agonist carbachol and the phase reset curves were compared. Cholinergic neuromodulation transformed the phase-reset curve from type II to type I. Since type and shape of the PRC have important implications for neuronal synchronization behavior, such modulation can change the global behavior of cortical networks.	Gutkin, B. S.; Dept.

For this purpose, I propose the two-dimensional cultured neural networks on multi-electrode array. The most important features of the two-dimensional culture neural network are that it is a system in which the information processing is autonomously carries out, and which is suitable for analyzing the molecules related to information processing. Using this system, it is possible to examine the process for the information processing by analyzing the behavior of neurons in a cellular level and a molecular level.We showed in a previous report that long-lasting potentiation in spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (SEPSCs) was induced by exposure to a Mg2+-free medium for 15 min in chick cerebral neurons, using the culture system that had been developed to examine cellular and molecular mechanisms of synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity (Kiyosue et al., 1996; Kiyosue et al., 1997; Tokioka et al., 1993). With this synaptic potentiation induced by the transient exposure to Mg2+-free condition, it is revealed that the pattern of action potentials segmented in cluster. In addition, the correlation of the patterns between nerve cells also changed. These results suggest that the neuronal network changes dynamically their behaviors if synaptic potentiation is induced.

Di Fiore, Anthony									Yearbook of Physical Anthropology		2003		46		62-99	62	99	English	print					In the past several decades, the development of novel molecular techniques and the advent of noninvasive DNA sampling, coupled with the ease and speed with which molecular analyses can now be performed, have made it possible for primatologists to directly examine the fitness effects of individual behavior and to explore how variation in behavior and social systems influences primate population genetic structure. This review describes the theoretical connections between individual behavior and primate social systems on the one hand and population genetic structure on the other, discusses the kinds of molecular markers typically employed in genetic studies of primates, and summarizes what primatologists have learned from molecular studies over the past few decades about dispersal patterns, mating systems, reproductive strategies, and the influence of kinship on social behavior. Several important conclusions can be drawn from this overview. First, genetic data confirm that, in many species, male dominance rank and fitness are positively related, at least over the short term, though this relationship need not simply be a reflection of male-male contest competition over mates. More importantly, genetic research reveals the significance of female choice in determining male reproductive success, and documents the efficacy of alternative mating tactics among males. Second, genetic data suggest that the presumed importance of kinship in structuring primate social relationships needs to be evaluated further, at least for some taxa such as chimpanzees in which demographic factors may be more important than relatedness. I conclude this paper by offering several suggestions of additional ways in which molecular techniques might be employed in behavioral and ecological studies of primates (e.g., for conducting "molecular censuses" of unhabituated populations, for studying disease and host-parasite interactions, or for tracking seed fate in studies of seed dispersal) and by providing a brief introduction to the burgeoning field of nonhuman primate behavioral genetics.

However, the social organization of these groups also offers the potential to provide an effective barrier against the transmission of pathogens within the colony. Social insects with their elaborate colony organizations provide an ideal model system to develop and test this hypothesis. While the different elements of colony organization are generally assumed to be products of ergonomic selection, in this paper we address how the same elements could influence the transmission of pathogens. By developing a simple model, we explore how three parameters of colony organization, division of labor, interaction network and colony demography could influence the transmission of pathogens. We find that heterogeneity among individuals in terms of division of labor alone has little effect on the spread of an infection in the colony and the scenario is indistinguishable from one in which all the individuals are homogeneous. However, division of labor, combined with heterogeneity in the interaction network and demographic schedules reduce the spread of an infection.

Adamo, Shelley A. (sadamo@is.dal.ca)									Brain Behavior and Evolution		2002		60	6	370-377	370	377	English	print					Neuromodulators can resculpt neural circuits, giving an animal the behavioral flexibility it needs to survive in a complex changing world. This ability, however, provides parasites with a potential mechanism for manipulating host behavior. This paper reviews three invertebrate host-parasite systems to examine whether parasites can change host behavior by secreting neuromodulators. The parasitic wasp, Cotesia congregata, suppresses host feeding partly by inducing the host (Manduca sexta) to increase the octopamine concentration in its hemolymph. The increased octopamine concentration disrupts the motor pattern produced by the frontal ganglion, preventing the ingestion of food. Polymorphus paradoxus (Acanthocephalan) alters the escape behavior of its host, Gammarus lacustris (Crustacea), possibly through an effect on the host's serotonergic system. The trematode Trichobilharzia ocellata inhibits egg-laying in its snail host (Lymnaea stagnalis), partly by inducing the host to secrete schistosomin. Schistosomin decreases electrical excitability of the caudodorsal cells. The parasite also alters gene expression for some neuromodulators within the host's central nervous system. In at least two of these three examples, it appears that the host, not the parasite, produces the neuromodulators that alter host behavior. Producing physiologically potent concentrations of neuromodulators may be energetically expensive for many parasites. Parasites may exploit indirect less energetically expensive methods of altering host behavior. For example, parasites may induce the host's immune system to produce the appropriate neuromodulators. In many parasites, the ability to manipulate host behavior may have evolved from adaptations designed to circumvent the host's immune system. Immune-neural-behavioral connections may be pre-adapted for parasitic manipulation.

Weakly electric fish offer a simple case study of this phenomenon since prey and communication signals differ significantly in their spatial extent. We demonstrate that sensory pyramidal neurons in these animals produce an oscillatory burst response to communication-like stimuli, but not to prey-like stimuli. Based on well-characterized circuitry, we construct a network model of pyramidal neurons that predicts diffuse delayed inhibitory feedback is required to achieve this oscillatory response to only communication-like stimuli. This prediction is experimentally verified by reversible blockade of feedback inhibition that removes the oscillatory burst response to communication-like stimuli. Our results show that a sensory system with inhibitory feedback can toggle between oscillatory and non-oscillatory firing states in a stimulus dependent fashion. Furthermore, we show how this network behavior modulates a previously described complex intrinsic burst mechanism within pyramidal cells. The ubiquitous nature of inhibitory feedback within sensory systems, and the simplicity of the network model, suggests that these results have widespread application.	Doiron, B.; Chacron, M.

In recent years, surveys of dragonfly communities have become a powerful tool for the ecological assessment of floodplain areas. The goal of this paper is to present a new approach towards assessing the ecological integrity of river-floodplain systems by analysing resident breeding dragonfly species. The methodology is based on experiences with existing approaches using macroinvertebrates as bioindicators, in particular, calculations of saprobic indices, longitudinal zonation and functional feeding group patterns. In addition to the total number of species and the number of sensitive species, the 'Odonate Habitat Index' (OHI) is a key element of the assessment method. It indicates characteristic features of a river-floodplain system, such as connectivity aspects, flow dynamics and terrestrialization processes. The OHI is calculated from the species-specific habitat values (expressing habitat preferences), abundances and the species-specific indication weight, which distinguishes eurytopic from stenotopic species. The comparison of the status quo with a reference condition allows an assessment of individual water bodies and/or of a whole area in a five-tiered classification scheme. The approach presented may also be used for the evaluation of restoration measures (e.g. reconnection of side arms) and for the definition of management objectives. Apart from the methodological framework, the results of a first application of this approach are presented in the paper as well. The study areas were selected floodplain systems of the Austrian section of the Danube and man-made inshore structures of the impounded Danube section in Vienna.

The motor pattern underlying locomotion can be elicited in the isolated spinal cord. The network consists of excitatory glutamatergic and inhibitory glycinergic interneurones with known connectivity. The current review addresses the different subtypes of ion channels that are present in the cell types that constitute the network. In particular the roles of the different subtypes of Ca2+ channels and potassium channels that regulate integrated neuronal functions, like frequency regulation, spike frequency adaptation and properties that are important for generating features of the motor pattern (e.g. burst termination), are reviewed. By knowing the role of an ion channel at the cellular level, we also, based on previous knowledge of network connectivity, can understand which effect a given ion channel may exert at the different levels from molecule and cell to network and behaviour.

Minorities and those with a substance abuse diagnosis were also more likely to be rated as having poor insight. No relationship was found between level of insight and age, gender, education level, neurocognitive deficits, hospitalization history, size of one's social network, or quality of life measures. Results are discussed in the context of improving the measurement and assessment of insight, conceptualizing interventions aimed at addressing level of insight, and improving outcomes for patients with severe and persistent mental illness. Findings also support a need for continued investigation of how mental illness is understood, experienced, and expressed across diverse groups of people living with mental illness.

We manipulated the evolutionary history of artificial neural network models and observed an emergent bias toward calls resembling known ancestral states. We then probed female tungara frogs for similar preferences, finding strong biases toward stimuli that resemble a call hypothesized for a recent ancestor.

Piscivory by fish is a dominant factor in both stream and lake systems whereas evidence for the importance of competition appears less convincing. Within small streams or lakes, the impact of predation may exclude other species, thereby leading to mutually exclusive distributions and strong differences in community composition. Within a geographic region, abiotic effects frequently dictate the relative importance of piscivory, thereby indirectly influencing the composition of prey species present. The spatial scale of studies influences our perceived importance of biotic versus abiotic factors, with small-scale studies indicating a greater importance of competition and large-scale studies emphasizing abiotic controls. The scale of the individual sites considered is critical because smaller systems have higher variability and wider extremes of conditions than larger lakes and rivers. The stability of physical systems and degree of spatial connectivity contribute to increased diversity in both larger stream and larger lake systems. We identify challenges and needs that must be addressed both to advance the field of fish community ecology and to face the problems associated with human-induced changes.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2000	July, 2000	64	3	615-631	615	631	English	print					Coordinated efforts by ecologists and natural resource managers are necessary to balance the conservation of biological diversity with the potential for sustained economic development. Because some amphibians have suffered world-wide declines during the last 20 years, it is important to consider biologically based management strategies that will preserve local and regional populations. This paper provides a brief overview of potential threats to local and regional populations, the state of knowledge on population and landscape processes, and the critical elements needed for an effective management plan for amphibians. Local population dynamics and ecological connectivity of amphibian metapopulations must be considered in effective management plans. There are 3 critical factors to consider in a management plan (1) the number or density of individuals dispersing from individual wetlands, (2) the diversity of wetlands with regard to hydroperiod, and (3) the probability of dispersal among adjacent wetlands or the rescue and recolonization of local populations. Wetlands losses reduce the total number of sites where pond-breeding amphibians can reproduce and recruit juveniles into the breeding population. Loss of small, temporary wetlands (<4.0 ha) may be especially harmful to amphibians because of their abundance and high species diversity. Alteration of wetlands, particularly hydrologic cycles, can severely impair completion of larval metamorphosis through either early pond drying (if hydroperiod is shortened) or through increased predation (if hydroperiod is lengthened or connections made with fish-infested lakes, rivers, or canals). Wetland loss also increases the distance between neighboring wetlands that is critical to metapopulation source-sink processes. Reduction in wetland density reduces the probability that populations will be rescued from extinction by nearby source populations. Local populations cannot be considered independent of source-sink processes that connect wetlands at the landscape or regional level. Further, the fragmentation of natural habitats from timber harvesting, agriculture, roads, drainage canals, or urban development impedes or prevents dispersal and decreases the probability of wetland recolonization. If our goal is to maintain or enhance present levels of amphibian diversity, then resource managers must incorporate critical elements into plans that protect population and landscape processes thereby maintaining viable populations and communities of amphibians.

For example, during embryogenesis in Drosophila, motor neurons in every body segment are wired into the circuitry that drives the simple peristaltic locomotion of the larva. Very little is known about the way in which the necessary central synapses are formed in such a network or how their properties are controlled. One possibility is that presynaptic and postsynaptic elements form relatively independently of each other. Alternatively, there might be an interaction between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons that allows for adjustment and plasticity in the embryonic network. Here we have addressed this issue by analysing the role of synaptic transmission in the formation of synaptic inputs onto identified motorneurons as the locomotor circuitry is assembled in the Drosophila embryo. We targeted the expression of tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC) to single identified neurons using the GAL4 system. TeTxLC prevents the evoked release of neurotransmitter by enzymatically cleaving the synaptic-vesicle-associated protein neuronal-Synaptobrevin (n-Syb). Unexpectedly, we found that the cells that expressed TeTxLC, which were themselves incapable of evoked release, showed a dramatic reduction in synaptic input. We detected this reduction both electrophysiologically and ultrastructurally.

We performed a series of simulation experiments to explore whether thresholds in landscape connectivity affect movement attributes (path length, net displacement, and fractal dimension of pathway) within fractal neutral landscapes. We then tested these assumptions by generating fractal landscape patterns in the field across a range of habitat abundances (0%, 20%, 50%, and 80% grass) and patchiness (clumped vs. patchy) and quantified how patch structure affected movement behavior in a generic organism, the common cricket Acheta domestica (Orthoptera: Gryllidae). In the simulation experiment, individuals constrained to move only through adjacent grass cells (neighborhood size = 4 cells) exhibited abrupt thresholds between 50% and 80% grass cover for all movement parameters in clumped fractal landscapes but exhibited a linear decline in movement with decreasing habitat in patchy landscapes.Individuals constrained to move in sand within these same landscapes did not exhibit thresholds in movement with decreasing sand habitat. The exception is for the fractal dimension of pathways (a measure of tortuosity) in which a threshold occurred between 50% and 80% grass (50% and 20% sand) in patchy landscapes. Increasing the scale of movement by allowing individuals to move through unsuitable habitat (neighborhood size = 12 cells) reduced or eliminated any effects of patch structure on movement. Live crickets can traverse both grass and sand, and thus threshold effects in movement behavior were generally not evident in the field experiment. Only small crickets (15-25 mm) exhibited a threshold response in net displacement (straight-line distance traversed) between 50% and 80% grass cover (50% and 20% sand). Crickets did exhibit significant responses to patch structure, however. Crickets moved faster and with less tortuosity in the control (0% grass) and less-vegetated (20% grass) plots than in plots with greater habitat coverage. Crickets used grass cells significantly more (73%) than expected in the 20% patchy fractal microlandscape; crickets were reluctant to leave isolated cells of grass. Grass provided cover, but sand facilitated movement. While experimentation at the landscape scale is generally intractable or impossible, computer simulation and field experiments founded on neutral landscape models permit initial assessment of how disrupting landscape connectivity affects movement behavior.

Chipmunks represent a less flexible response, retaining their preference for wooded habitat. White-footed mice represent a more flexible, opportunistic response, expanding their use of the landscape to include corn and small-grain fields. Model parameters were derived from our field studies. The simulations followed chipmunk populations over 25 yr in 36 landscape patterns, each with a unique combination of amount of wooded habitat (10%, 30%, or 50% of the total area), subdivision of wooded habitat (2, 4, or 8 patches), and quality of connectivity (high, intermediate, low, or none). Mouse populations were simulated in 8 of these landscapes (30% wooded habitat, 4 patches at each level of connectivity, and 10% wooded habitat, 8 patches at each level of connectivity). Generalist mice outperformed specialist chipmunks in all subdivided landscapes in which they were compared. Since generalist mice were not restricted to woods and fencerows, all landscapes were highly connected for them and provided over 75% usable habitat. Survival rates for these mice were high in all landscape patterns. For opportunistic species able to use novel resources, landscape change may not be limiting. Connectivity was the best predictor of population persistence for specialist species that view the matrix as hostile. Chipmunk population survival was always greater in connected landscapes than in unconnected ones. Interactions of connectivity, composition and configuration were also important. Long survival times and low probabilities of extinction for chipmunk populations occurred in model landscapes with 30% or more woodland, and high and intermediate quality connectivity. Chipmunk populations in 8 patch landscapes with only 10% woodland and low connectivity had high extinction probabilities. Highly variable population size increased risk of extinction, especially when amount of wooded habitat was low. For behaviourally inflexible species, maintenance of habitat connectivity when habitat subdivision and accompanying habitat loss occur is vital to survival.	Landscape Ecol. Lab., Dep.

AIDS (London)		1996		10	6	657-666	657	666	English						Objective: To provide time-trend estimates of HIV-1 prevalence among injecting drug users (IDU) in London. Design: HIV-1 prevalence and HIV testing behaviour were measured in four serial point prevalence surveys of IDU recruited at multiple sites in community-based nontreatment and drug treatment settings between 1 990 and 1 993. Methods: Community subjects were recruited through social network sampling by trained indigenous interviewers; treatment subjects were interviewed at agencies. With informed consent, subjects responded to a structured questionnaire covering risk behaviour. Volunteered saliva samples were tested anonymously for anti-HIV-1. Statistical comparisons across years were examined using mixed binomial logistic and loglinear models. Pearson's chi-2 and Fisher's exact tests were also used for some two-group comparisons. Results: Similar samples were recruited each year. HIV-1 prevalence rate declined from 12.8% in 1990, 9.8% in 1991, 7.0% in 1992, to 6.9% in 1993. The statistical modelling suggested that the overall trend in prevalence rates was one of decelerating decline. There was no difference in prevalence rate by gender and length of injecting. Less than one-half (46%) had received a named HIV test. Over one-half of the HIV-positive IDU were unaware of their status. Conclusions: The pattern of decline in HIV-1 prevalence rate is attributed to changes in risk behavior following HIV prevention interventions.	Stimson, Gerry V.; Centre Res.

Journal of Experimental Biology		1995		198	3	665-673	665	673	English						Two major tasks must be fulfilled during locomotion: propulsion and spatial orientation. In the lamprey, the propulsive force is generated by laterally directed body undulations propagated from the rostral to the caudal end of the body. The neuronal networks underlying this basic locomotor pattern have been described in considerable detail. The present study was undertaken to provide the necessary behavioural background for parallel studies of the vestibular neuronal networks responsible for spatial orientation during locomotion. The following results were obtained. 1. The lamprey actively stabilized its pitch angle during swimming and usually kept a linear trajectory in the sagittal plane, despite large changes in the speed of swimming. During repeated tests, a certain preferred pitch angle could be maintained over a period of several minutes, even if the initial starting angle of the animal was changed considerably. 2. Two different strategies were observed for active turning in the downward direction: a smooth turn accomplished by weak ventral flexion of the whole body, and a sharp turn accomplished by localized ventral flexion of a region of the body just posterior to the gills. 3. The lampreys were oriented with the dorsal side up while swimming at any pitch angle. The control systems for pitch and roll can thus operate independently. When swimming, lampreys kept the tail region flexed somewhat ventrally. This body configuration will cause lateral movements of the tail to generate a torque that rotates the body around its longitudinal axis. This mechanism is presumably used to correct deviations from the dorsal side-up orientation. After amputation of the dorsal and tail fins, lampreys maintained a proper spatial orientation during swimming. 4. After a unilateral labyrinthectomy, swimming lampreys continuously rolled towards the lesioned side. Unilaterally labyrinthectomized animals displayed a tonic twisting of the body into a helical shape. This presumably represents an additional strategy for performing roll turns. Bilaterally labyrinthectomized animals never maintained a linear trajectory in any plane, but turned continuously in all directions.	Nobel Inst.

Journal of Muscle Research and Cell Motility		1994		15	3	299-308	299	308	English						In the series-fibred muscle architecture commonly found in large muscles of mammals and birds, the intrafasciculary-terminating muscle fibres have no direct tendinous attachments. Contractile force produced in these fibres must be transmitted between adjacent muscle fibres via the endomysial connective tissue which separates them. The endomysium is thus an essential mechanical component in such muscles. Studies of motor end-plate banding patterns and the frequent occurrence of tapering ends of fibres within the fascicles of the bovine sternomandibularis muscle show it to be a series-fibred muscle. Sodium hydroxide digestion of fixed samples of this muscle to remove the myofibrillar apparatus revealed the endomysium to be a disordered planar network of mainly curvilinear collagen fibrils. The orientation distribution of the collagen fibrils in the endomysial network was measured by image analysis of scanning electron micrographs. Analysis of endomysial preparations from muscle fixed at sarcomere lengths between 1-4 mu-m showed that the orientation distribution of collagen fibrils is quantitatively related to muscle length. At rest sarcomere length the collagen fibril network is not completely random, but has a slight circumferential bias. The orientation distribution shows a progressive shift towards the circumferential direction at short sarcomere lengths and towards the longitudinal direction at long sarcomere lengths. The relationship between the number-weighted mean collagen orientation and sarcomere length was compared to two geometric models of network behaviour, the isoareal and constant shape models. Both fitted the data reasonably, although the constant shape model described the rate of change of mean orientation more closely. From fibrous composites theory, the reinforcement efficiency factor, eta was calculated from the measured collagen fibril orientation distributions. These calculations predict a non-linearly increasing longitudinal tensile modulus for the endomysium with increasing sarcomere length, in agreement with its known non-linear properties, but confirm that the tensile properties of the endomysium are unsuitable for transmission of tensile force from muscle fibres contracting near rest length. This reinforces a previous interpretation that contractile force is transmitted between neighboring muscle fibres by trans-laminar shear through the endomysium rather than by inplane tension.

This study presents a latent-variable approach to separate several sources and types of support and to determine the validity of a social support battery administered to a group of 739 young adults. Three theoretically distinct components of social support were considered: Type of support, source of support, and functional area of support. Type of support was reflected by amount (quantity) and satisfaction (quality); sources of support included family, friends, and organizations; and functional areas considered were drug use, finances, health, intimate relationships, phychological or emotional distress, and work or employment. A total of 36 (=2*3*6) social support items were developed by fully crossing the combinations among the components. Latent-variable models verified a clear hypothesized structure of traits, indicating that these social support items very adequately reflected their underlying constructs. A second-order latent factor captured the association among the siz functional area factors of social support. This suggests that the areas considered in assessing social supporty may generalize, and reflect a life experience that is broadly supported or not supported by important others in one's social network.

The BCIs have their cell bodies in the buccal ganglion, but send axons to the cerebral ganglion via the cerebral-buccal connectives. The BCIs appear to make monosynaptic connections with neurons in the cerebral ganglion that modulate extrinsic muscles involved in feeding behavior. B17 and B18 are activated antiphasically during a motor program induced by stimulating the esophageal nerve and appear to "read out" different phases of the buccal program to different cells in the cerebral ganglion. B17 and B18 are not necessary, and probably not sufficient, to generate the buccal program. These BCIs, and other cells like them in the buccal ganglion, may be capable of coordinating the activity of the intrinsic muscles of the buccal mass with the activity of its extrinsic muscles, and perhaps with those of the lips, mouth, and tentacles. Identified histaminergic neuron, C2, can modulate the outputs of the BCIs onto their synaptic followers in the cerebral ganglion. Firing of C2 inhibits spiking of the BCIs, probably via cerebral-buccal interneurons. C2 also decreases the size of the EPSP that B17 and B18 evoke in cerebral neuron C4. C2 appears to do so monosynaptically, and it decreases the conductance of C4, ruling out one possible postsynaptic mechanism of action. Variance analysis of the EPSPs evoked by B18 supports the hypothesis that C2 acts presynaptically to decrease the release of transmitter. Applications of histamine to the solution bathing the neuron mimic the effect of firing C2 and reduce the size of the EPSPs B18 induces in C4. The bath-applied histamine appears to act directly on B18, since it elicits a voltage-dependent increased conductance hyperpolarization recorded in the soma of B18, and the hyperpolarization persists in a solution in which synaptic transmission has been blocked. Histamine did not produce any marked changes of the duration of a TEA-broadened somatic action potential of B18. To the extent that the soma of B18 reflects the membrane properties of its synaptic terminal region, the data suggest that histamine may produce presynaptic inhibition by hyperpolarizing the synaptic terminal region.

Ingestion is terminated as a result of distension of the body: experimentally distending leeches as they feed causes an immediate cessation of ingestion and inhibits any subsequent biting behaviour; if distension is circumvented by various experimental procedures, leech ingestive periods are prolonged significantly. Ingestion is not terminated as a result of fatigue, chemical cues or mass change. Distension also underlies satiation, for removing blood from the crops of recently fed leeches qualitatively alters their satiated behaviour to biting. Biting is not a defensive reaction to injury. In rostral ganglia, impulses of the serotonergic Retzius (RZ) and LL neurones evoked the physiological components of ingestion. Localized warming of the prostomial lip induces impulses in these large effector neurones. Distending the body wall tonically hyperpolarizes the RZ and LL cells. This inhibitory response to distension is conducted from the mid-body to the anterior neurones via the ventral nerve cord. Distensive inhibition antagonizes the synaptic excitation evoked in RZ and LL neurones by thermal stimulation. Thus, a stimulus which evokes feeding synaptically excites 5-HT neurones and a stimulus which terminates ingestion inhibits them. The integration of these inputs controls the expression of leech feeding behaviour and these connections match precisely a model proposed to regulate the ingestive behaviour of blowflies.

VIEW AND MEASURES FOR PROMOTION OF LOCAL AGRICULTURE		KOBAE S									Bulletin of the Faculty of Agriculture Miyazaki University		1986		33	2	119-128	119	128	Japanese						The future view and measures for the promotion of local agriculture were positively studied in connection with the work of "Reorganization of Local and Regional Agriculture" by giving the example of agriculture in the Mimitsu district, Hyuga City, Miyazaki prefecture [Japan]. The future promotion of local agriculture does not set a goal in the increase of the gross weight and total amount of local agricultural production but secures the definite agricultural income in a farmhouse or farmhouse group of middle standing in a local area. The density of the local agriculture in Hyuga City is high but, in comparison with the other districts in this prefecture, productivity is low except small-to-medium sized stockbreeding farmhouses and the possibility for enlarging the scale of working cultivated acreage is low because the ratio of exclusive farmhouses and utilization factor of farmland are low. Because the agricultural income level in this district is largely influenced by an income with a side job, it is necessary to restudy a crop kind, a cultivating system, intensive cultivation, sectional combination or the like. Furthermore, an objective income level should be set to that of neighborhood poultry farming manufacturers. In this district, not only individual farmhouses but also various "spots" and "nuclei" are present. This study work should achieve function as the functional dynamic line connecting these elements. In addition, for the purpose of the development and promotion of the agriculture in this district, there are fundamental problems such as the agricultural and organic cooperation of a regional community, the grasping of actual conditions in individual agricultural management, the complemental practical use of the preceding works or the like.					0	0		0	0	0			Agriculture; Biodiversity & Conservation; Anthropology	0544-6066				Agronomy (Agriculture); Animal Husbandry (Agriculture); Conservation; Human Ecology (Anthropology)	00512, General biology - Conservation and resource management; 05500, Social biology and human ecology; 27002, Poultry production - General and methods; 27006, Poultry production - Breeds and breeding; 52502, Agronomy - Miscellaneous and mixed crops	Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Aves [85500]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]									POULTRY AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT PRODUCTIVITY BREEDING				2021-06-29	J	BCI:BCI198681042465		Article		URBAN WOODLANDS AREAL DISTRIBUTION AND SOME SPATIAL AND ECOLOGICAL CONNECTIONS USING TALLINN ESTONIAN-SSR USSR AS AN EXAMPLE		SANDER K									Eesti NSV Teaduste Akadeemia Toimetised Bioloogia		1985		34	3	205-215	205	215	Russian						The paper deals with numerical changes in individual wooded areas and their dependence on the density of highways, streets, railways and the network of major streams within the boundaries of Tallinn (the river Pirita, the brook Tiskre, the canal system of Lake Ulemiste) as well as on the corridors of high-voltage transmission lines. It was found out that the size distribution of wooded plots as an interval line (relative frequency per interval unit) could be described by the equation y = ax-(b - clog lx + d log2x), where x - size of wooded plots (average of interval), a, b, c, and d - empirical coefficients and y = .**GRAPHIC**. Here fi - number of wooded plots in an intervals, n - total number of plots and .DELTA.xi - width of the interval. Resulting from the different arrangement of wooded plots with regard of the above-mentioned line elements (highways, streets, railways, etc.) the size distributions of these areas can be described by connections y = ax-(b + clogx) and y = ax-b. On the analogy of the latter the dependence of the variations in the temperature of the wooded plots within an area as well as the dependence of the number of several insect species (Diptera, Coleoptera) may be described. Comparing the corresponding empirical coefficients, it turns out that resulting from the above-mentioned line elements, the size distribution of the wooded plots changes faster than the temperature dependence and the number of the insect species in the parks.

Study was restricted to situations involving spatial competition among sessile, colonial invertebrates in the absence of disturbance. Variables in this model include overgrowth ranking patterns, recruitment rates, growth rates, overgrowth rates, substratum size (i.e., size of a spatial array), and species number; in terms of species richness, complex networks > simple networks > hierarchies. A large range in recruitment rates greatly reduced species richness in simple network simulations due to the decreased frequency of encounters between the lowest- and highest-ranked species forming the network loops. Reduction in substratum size had a similar effect on species richness and also reduced the predictability of species recruitment. Increases in species number (size of available pool) reduced species richness in simple network simulations, again due to reduced encounter frequencies, but also increased species richness in complex network simulations. A large range in overgrowth rates drastically reduced species richness in complex network simulations. The spatial array in these simulations was not always dominated by the species with the highest overgrowth rate, indicating the importance of position effects as well as growth effects. Network situations should strongly favor the selection for mechanisms which inhibit rates of overgrowth and which allow lower ranked species to find favorable locations (i.e., refuges) such as small substrata or sites adjacent to higher ranked species which they can overgrow.

The threshold was given by the number of coulombs in current pulses that excited a particular fiber half the time when delivered to the whole nerve. Threshold was tracked by a device that incrementally decreased the number of coulombs in the current pulse whenever the fiber responded and increased the pulse if it did not respond. There was a pattern to the after-oscillations of threshold following activity. The fibers were briefly refractory, transiently superexcitable for about 1-1.5 s and then entered a phase of raised threshold or depression that lasted for many minutes. Activity produced little change in the threshold curve during the refractory period. After an impulse, superexcitability reached a maximum within 7-20 ms. This peak was larger as the number of impulses in a preceding burst increased and as the intervals between the impulses became briefer. The depression phase was marked by the interaction between build-up, which required as long as an hour or more for the threshold to be completely restored to resting level. These 2 mechanisms, 1 causing build-up and the other recovery, led to formation of dynamic equilibria. The processes associated with superexcitability interact with those producing depression. In active fibers showing raised thresholds, impulses are followed by a relative superexcitability that persists for at least as long as an absolute superexcitability (with threshold below the resting level) which can be measured in the same fiber at rest. The duration of the superexcitable phase interpreted as a relative change in excitability was roughly the same regardless of the level of depression. The magnitude of the oscillation in threshold was 5-10 times larger than the gray region (the range of stimuli for which response is probabilistic). At regions of low conduction safety such as axonal branches, where weak forces can influence whether an impulse will pass, such pronounced and long-lasting after-effects of firing can be expected to modulate conduction of nerve impulses. Two implications are drawn: the static connectivity of an axon, as determined by its anatomy, will in general differ from its dynamic connectivity as defined by the subset of its branches that conduct each impulse through the arbour to synaptic endings; the temporal pattern of firing in the axonal trunk will produce trhoughout the teledendron a distributed time function of local thresholds that reflects the firing patterns, suggesting that the messages encoded in the pattern of firing may be resolved by variation of connectivity according to message.

A new type of holistic approach to developmental phenomena is suggested allowing for the dominating role of the descending interlevel connections. The dynamic structure of each level of organization involves several structurally stable and unstable zones, and the processes of lower levels at the moments of their instability are parameterized by the processes of upper levels. The progressive evolution is probably accompanied by a strengthening of interlevel connections. Genome and embryonic inductors determine the developmental parameters.

Three nests of C. japonica and 4 of C. iwatai, each containing 2 or more females in brood rearing condition are recorded. The relations among co-habiting females are variable: semisocial, delayed eusocial, eosocial and quasisocial. The significance of these findings is discussed in connection with social evolution and various social types found or assumed in Hymenoptera.

A study of post-embryonic development revealed numerous special characteristics. Neuters are all female from the time of hatching onwards, and doubtless from time of laying as well. Determination of the neuter or reproductive line is made before hatching and gonadic growth of these 2 lines assumes a different direction from the 1st larval stage. Neuters continue to develop during the developmental period of reproductives. Larval development comprises 3 stages of inactive individuals, with a sudden change to worker stage at the end of the 3rd molt. These workers then acquire symbiotic intestinal fauna. They can cover 5 successive stages without developing into an adult form. They originate from larvae or from workers of a previous stage. No pseudergate has been observed. The workers show a certain polyethism: 1st stage individuals stay in the nest, those of later stages search for food and perform building tasks. The soldiers are divided into: small soldiers, born from specific larvae, isolated from the 1st stage onwards; medium-sized soldiers, resulting from workers of different stages; and large soldiers originating from different worker stages. All pass through a white soldier stage and exercise inhibitory action on the formation of new soldiers. This auto-regulation seems to be due to a pheromone. The reproductive line consists of 6 stages and its development extends over 11 mo. The nymphs are inactive and are fed by workers. Each year the same colony forms 2 series of reproductives which swarm at the moment of 2 maximum rainfalls. The sex-ratio of swarming individuals favors females. The imago couple, rare in adult colonies, is replaced by female ergatoid neotenics and by male and female nymphoid neotenics. These generally pass through a preneotenic stage. In primary colonies, post-embryonic development is accelerated, the small soldiers are more numerous than workers, and large soldiers and reproductives are absent. The chromosomic disparity between the germinal and somatic lines would explain the sexual determinism of abnormal types. S. lamanianus, although classified anatomically and physiologically with the lower termites, presents a polymorphism and a social organization connecting it with the higher termites, indicating a different speed of evolution for different characteristics. This demonstrates the difficulty of adding new data to general conception and theory of termite evolution.					0	0		0	31	41			Behavioral Sciences; Developmental Biology; Evolutionary Biology; Physiology; Life Sciences & Biomedicine - Other Topics	0020-1812				Behavior; Development; Evolution and Adaptation; Physiology; Systematics and Taxonomy	01500, Evolution; 03510, Genetics - Sex differences; 07003, Behavioral biology - Animal behavior; 07006, Behavioral biology - Animal communication; 07504, Ecology: environmental biology - Bioclimatology and biometeorology; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal; 17002, Endocrine - General; 18504, Integumentary system - Physiology and biochemistry; 25508, Development and Embryology - Morphogenesis; 63590, Invertebrata: general and systematic - Insecta: other orders; 64076, Invertebrata: comparative, experimental morphology, physiology and pathology - Insecta: physiology	Microorganisms; Microorganisms; Microorganisms [01000]/Plantae; Plants; Plantae [11000]/Insecta, Arthropoda, Invertebrata, Animalia; Animals, Arthropods, Insects, Invertebrates; Isoptera [75328]									WOOD INTESTINAL FLORA NEST POST EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT PHEROMONE SEXUAL DIMORPHISM EVOLUTION				2021-06-29	B	BCI:BCI197763015219		Book Meeting		PERSPECTIVES IN FOREST ENTOMOLOGY PROCEEDINGS OF A LOCKWOOD CONFERENCE ON PERSPECTIVES OF FOREST PEST MANAGEMENT NEW-HAVEN CONNECTICUT USA OCTOBER 15-17 1975		ANDERSON J F; KAYA H K									PERSPECTIVES IN FOREST ENTOMOLOGY PROCEEDINGS OF A LOCKWOOD CONFERENCE ON PERSPECTIVES OF FOREST PEST MANAGEMENT NEW-HAVEN CONNECTICUT USA OCTOBER 15-17 1975		1976				428	428		English						This volume, designed to bring current knowledge on forest pest mamagement into perspective, is divided into 4 sections.

ARCH NEERLAND ZOOL		1940		4	(4)	443-520	443	520	English						On the supposition that an instinct is a purposive behavior system, 3 ways of interaction of instincts have been investigated, based on research with cormorants and other birds. 1) If changes in the conditions of life and in hormonal operations modify the strength of a given instinctive "appetite" (Craig), energy is thereby released or additional energy is required. This transference of energy has an effect on all appetities. 2) The animal is not able to inhibit an impulse once it is aroused. If the abilities by which a given impulse normally arrives at extinction are inhibited, the impulse always "sparks over" to the same definite behavior group. The "sparking-over" operates mutually (e.g., fighting impulse to mating and nesting; sexual and nest-building impulse to fighting). Thus certain fixed connections exist among behavior groups. Actions originated by spark-ing-over at first sight look very much like the corresponding but autochtonous actions, but on closer investigations the essential is invariably found to be wanting: Sparking-over copulations always fail; in sparking-over-nest-building, the twig is never worked in; etc. The coordinator that brings about the purposiveness in normal action seems to be absent. This is called the "active appetite." 3) When a bird sees or hears another of the same sp. behave in a certain way, it often does the same thing; at any rate, the author believes it aims at the same purpose. It often happens, however, that it acts differently (e.g., on witnessing flight, it may begin to shake out its feathers). Here the connection between 2 forms of behavior seems to be of the same nature as in the "sparking-over" action, but this unexplained kind of induced action fails to show the characteristic traits of sparking-over action. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: A.G.

By ligating the pupa at different levels, the developmental agent is found to be localized in a definite region of the thorax, although the exact location is still unknown. Once abdominal ectoderm has received the impulse to develop, it continues to differentiate even without help from the anterior portion. When 2 complete pupae of different ages are joined so that the developmental factor is undisturbed, then each develops independently. The "Testabdomen," the abdomen removed from a young pupa, does not develop toward the adult state unless it is joined with an equally old whole pupa, in which case the development is synchronous. The "Testabdomen" develops equally well at any orientation to the complete pupa. The pupa possesses the developmental stimulus until the 3d day after pupation. When the "Testabdomen" is united with complete animals of different ages, development of the coalesced components does not proceed synchronously. The developmental impulse is apparently transmitted through the ectoderm, as suggested by the behavior of parts connected by glass tubes and the various fusion and cauterization expts. In the discussion, the author compares his results with those of Crampton, who first joined portions of pupae, thus developing an interesting new exptl. method for the investigation of developmental correlations in insects. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: S.
