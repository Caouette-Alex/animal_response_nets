Systematic conservation planning is a widely used approach to achieve this, but there is growing concern that it must better integrate the human social dimensions of conservation to be effective. Yet, fundamental insights about when social data are most critical to inform conservation planning decisions are lacking. To address this problem, we derived novel principles to guide strategic investment in social network information for systematic conservation planning. We considered the common conservation problem of identifying which social actors, in a social network, to engage with to incentivize conservation behavior that maximizes the number of species protected. We used simulations of social networks and species distributed across network nodes to identify the optimal state-dependent strategies and the value of social network information. We did this for a range of motif network structures and species distributions and applied the approach to a small-scale fishery in Kenya. The value of social network information depended strongly on both the distribution of species and social network structure. When species distributions were highly nested (i.e., when species-poor sites are subsets of species-rich sites), the value of social network information was almost always low. This suggests that information on how species are distributed across a network is critical for determining whether to invest in collecting social network data. In contrast, the value of social network information was greatest when social networks were highly centralized. Results for the small-scale fishery were consistent with the simulations. Our results suggest that strategic collection of social network data should be prioritized when species distributions are un-nested and when social networks are likely to be centralized. © 2020 The Authors.

Social network analysis is a powerful quantitative tool for assessing the social structure formed by associations between individuals. However, demographic processes are rarely accounted for in such analyses. Here, we summarize how the structure of animal social networks is shaped by the joint effects of social behavior and turnover of individuals and suggest how a deeper understanding of these processes can open new, exciting avenues for research. Death or dispersal can have the direct effect of removing an individual and all its social connections, and can also have indirect effects, spurring changes in the distribution of social connections between remaining individuals. Recruitment and integration of juveniles and immigrant into existing social networks are critical to the emergence and persistence of social network structure. Together, these behavioral responses to loss and gain of social partners may impact how societies respond to seasonal or catastrophic turnover events. The fitness consequences of social position (e.g., survival and reproductive rates) may also create feedback between the social network structure and demography. Understanding how social structure changes in response to turnover of individuals requires further integration between long-term field studies and network modeling methods. These efforts will likely yield new insights into the connections between social networks and life history, ecological change, and evolutionary dynamics. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

We discuss the effects of social network structure on evolutionary dynamics (genetic drift, fixation probabilities, and frequency-dependent selection) and social evolution (cooperation and between-individual behavioural differences). We discuss how social network structure can affect important coevolutionary processes (host-pathogen interactions and mutualisms) and population stability.

Social network analyses can use patterns of spatial and temporal co-occurrence to describe the social associations of individuals within a population, such as which opposite-sex individuals are found together more frequently than others as an indicator of their degree of social monogamy. Social networks generated using automated radio frequency identification (RFID) tracking systems may provide insights into the social behavior of secretive animals because they enable the automated and continuous tracking of the social associations among individuals, which can address many of the limitations with studying these kinds of species. We assessed the potential for social networks generated using an automated RFID tracking system to describe the social behavior of prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) in semi-natural enclosures. Our aim was to assess whether social networks generated using the RFID system provided meaningful insights into the social behavior of voles by comparing this method to other methods that have been traditionally used in laboratory (partner preference tests) or field (degree of home range overlap) studies to study social monogamy in prairie voles. In partner preference tests conducted in the field, females spent more time with males with which they had stronger social network associations. Voles that had stronger social network associations also had home ranges that overlapped considerably more than dyads with lower social network associations. In addition, social networks generated from live-trapping and RFID data were comparable but social networks generated using data from our RFID system recorded almost twice as many social associations overall. Our results show that social association metrics derived from social networks generated using the RFID tracking system reflect other commonly used measures of social monogamy in prairie voles. Overall, this suggests that patterns of spatial and temporal co-occurrence are meaningful measures of social monogamy in wild animals. © 2018 Sabol, Solomon and Dantzer.","Association index; RFID system; Social behavior; Social monogamy; Social network analyses; Vole",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057245026

As with humans, social behaviours in other animals often occur within a broad interconnected network of social ties. Yet studies of animal social behaviour tend to focus on associations between pairs of individuals. With the increase in popularity of social network analysis, researchers have started to look beyond the dyad to examine the role of indirect connections in animal societies. Here, I provide an overview of the new knowledge that has been uncovered by these studies. I focus on research that has addressed both the causes of social behaviours, i.e. the cognitive and genetic basis of indirect connections, as well as their consequences, i.e. the impact of indirect connections on social cohesion, information transfer, cultural practices and fitness. From these studies, it is apparent that indirect connections play an important role in animal behaviour, although future research is needed to clarify their contribution. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Cooperation; Culture; Fitness; Heritability; Indirect exchange; Social brokers; Social learning; Social network analysis","animal; behavioral ecology; cognition; cooperative behavior; fitness; heritability; knowledge; learning; social network; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939417628

Through combining the automated tracking of winter flocks of over 500 wild great tits (Parus major) with removal experiments, we assessed how individuals’ social network positions responded to the loss of their social associates. We found that the extent of flockmate loss that individuals experienced correlated positively with subsequent increases in the number of their social associations, the average strength of their bonds and their overall connectedness within the social network (defined as summed edge weights). Increased social connectivity was not driven by general disturbance or changes in foraging behaviour, but by modifications to fine-scale social network connections in response to losing their associates. Therefore, the reduction in social connectedness expected by individual loss may be mitigated by increases in social associations between remaining individuals. Given that these findings demonstrate rapid adjustment of social network associations in response to the loss of previous social ties, future research should examine the generality of the compensatory adjustment of social relations in ways that maintain the structure of social organization. © 2017 The Authors.","Population declines; Social bonds; Social foraging; Social networks; Social perturbation; Social structure","bird; environmental disturbance; foraging behavior; population decline; social behavior; social network; social structure; species flock; tracking; wild population; Animalia; Aves; Parus major; animal; animal behavior; Passeriformes; physiology; population density; season; social behavior; wild animal; Animals; Animals, Wild; Behavior, Animal; Passeriformes; Population Density; Seasons; Social Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019648122

We sought to understand how noise affected space-use and social connectivity in a small passerine bird, the Red-backed Fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus). As the displaced birds would likely be forced to occupy a smaller area that may already have resident individuals, we predicted that noise-affected birds would show increased social connectivity that may include new individuals. To test this, we introduced an experimental point-source of traffic noise to groups of fairywrens in an otherwise quiet habitat and compared the change in social connectivity of birds in groups exposed to noise to the changes in social connectivity in neighbouring groups unaffected by noise. Contrary to our prediction, noise-affected birds had reduced social connectivity during experimental noise treatments, as measured by weighted-degree, which was driven by a reduction of interactions with birds of neighbouring groups outside the noise zone. Additionally, we did not discern a change in space-use in response to our noise treatment. Therefore, we suggest that noise reduces the efficacy of signal transmission and detection in this species, resulting in the reduction of social connectivity between groups of this otherwise highly social songbird. © 2020 BirdLife Australia.","Fairywrens; social connectivity; social networks; traffic noise","anthropogenic effect; calling behavior; connectivity; conservation management; human activity; noise pollution; passerine; signal; social behavior; space use; traffic emission; Malurus melanocephalus; Passeri; Passeriformes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094168501

Animals have different roles in social networks. Understanding individual positions in social networks is important for effective management and ensuring positive welfare for all animals. Using elephants as a case study, the aim of this research was to investigate temporal social dynamics in zoo animals. Behavioural data were collected between January 2016 and February 2017 from 10 African and 22 Asian elephants housed at seven zoos and safari parks in the UK and Ireland. Social interactions were defined as positive physical, positive non‐physical, negative physical or negative non-physical. Social network analysis explored social relationships including the fluidity of networks over time and dyadic reciprocity. Social interaction networks were found to be fluid but did not follow a seasonal pattern. Positive interaction networks tended to include the entire social group whereas negative interactions were restricted to specific individuals. Unbalanced ties were observed within dyads, suggesting potential inequalities in relationships. This could impact on individual experiences and welfare. This research highlights subtle temporal dynamics in zoo elephants with the potential for species‐level differences. Similar temporal dynamics may also be present in other socially housed zoo species. This research thus provides evidence for the importance of understanding the social networks of zoo animals over longer periods of time. Understanding social networks enables pro‐active and evidence‐based management approaches. Further research should seek to identify the minimum sampling efforts for social networks in a range of species, to enable the implementation of regular monitoring of social networks and thus improve the welfare of social species under human care. © 2020 by the authors.

Using the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, we identified the general properties of the social dynamics underlying fish social networks and found that they are highly robust to differences in population density and habitat changes. Movement simulations showed that this robustness could buffer changes in transmission processes over a surprisingly large density range. These simulation results suggest that the ability of social systems to self-stabilise could have important implications for the spread of infectious diseases and information. In contrast to habitat manipulations, social manipulations (e.g. change of sex ratios) produced strong, but short-lived, changes in network dynamics. Lastly, we discuss how the evolution of the observed social dynamics might be linked to predator attack strategies. We argue that guppy social networks are an emergent property of social dynamics resulting from predator–prey co-evolution. Our study highlights the need to develop dynamic models of social networks in connection with an evolutionary framework. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Environmental change; Habitat manipulation; Network analysis; Population translocation; Social dynamics","coevolution; cyprinid; disease spread; environmental change; evolutionary biology; infectious disease; movement; population distribution; predator-prey interaction; sex ratio; social behavior; social network; Animalia; Poecilia reticulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941318179

Here, we take a social network perspective to investigate whether patterns of social contact within groups influence parasite risk. Specifically, increased modularity (i. e. sub-grouping) in larger groups could offset the increased disease risk associated with living in a large group. We simulated the spread of a contagious pathogen in random social networks to generate theoretically grounded predictions concerning the relationship between social network connectivity and the success of socially transmitted pathogens. Simulations yielded the prediction that community modularity (Q) negatively impacts parasite success. No clear predictions emerged for a second network metric we considered, the eigenvector centralization index (C), as the relationship between this measure and parasite success depended on the transmission probability of parasites. We then tested the prediction that Q reduces parasite success in a phylogenetic comparative analysis of social network modularity and parasite richness across 19 primate species. Using a Bayesian implementation of phylogenetic generalized least squares and controlling for sampling effort, we found that primates living in larger groups exhibited higher Q, and as predicted by our simulations, higher Q was associated with lower richness of socially transmitted parasites. This suggests that increased modularity mediates the elevated risk of parasitism associated with living in larger groups, which could contribute to the inconsistent findings of empirical studies on the association between group size and parasite risk. Our results indicate that social networks may play a role in mediating pressure from socially transmitted parasites, particularly in large groups where opportunities for transmitting communicable diseases are abundant. We propose that parasite pressure in gregarious primates may have favored the evolution of behaviors that increase social network modularity, especially in large social groups. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agent-based model; Comparative study; Infectious disease; Parasite richness; Primates; Social networks; Sociality","community structure; disease spread; ecological modeling; eusociality; evolutionary biology; group size; infectious disease; parasite transmission; pathogen; phylogenetics; primate; risk assessment; social network; species richness; Animalia; Primates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862017852

In particular, the presence of long-lasting social ties has been highlighted as a hallmark of social complexity; however, the presence of such ties can be masked in fission–fusion systems like that exhibited by most parrot species. Social network analysis has the potential to elucidate such multi-level dynamics. While most parrot species are tropical canopy dwellers, a subset has successfully colonized urban habitats, where they are often the focus of much public interest. Our study takes advantage of this to use citizen science to collect observations of wing-tagged sulphur-crested cockatoos in central Sydney and record their social associations over multiple years. Using a specifically designed mobile phone application ‘Wingtags’, we collected over >27,000 citizen science reports of wing-tagged cockatoos, and built social networks from spatial-temporal co-occurrences in observations for 130 tagged birds. To validate this novel methodology, we GPS-tagged a subset of wing-tagged birds and compared networks built from both data collection methods. We then examined correlates of social network structure before exploring the temporal dynamics of network structure and social associations. Social networks constructed from GPS data and citizen science data were highly correlated, suggesting that this novel methodology is robust. Network structure exhibited little seasonal variability and was largely driven by roost site choice; however, individuals also showed a surprising degree of mixing between roosts in their foraging associations. Finally, within this larger fission–fusion system, individuals tended to maintain specific social ties for long periods of time. There was an effect of age on these temporal dynamics, with aging individuals increasing both social stability and longevity of associations. Our findings highlight the utility of citizen science to measure social networks in urban species, and add to the evidence that long-lasting social associations can persist in fission–fusion social systems such as those observed in wild sulphur-crested cockatoos. © 2020 The Authors.

Here I use social network analysis to characterize and compare patterns of sociality between three populations of the leaf-roosting bat Thyroptera tricolor. Sites differed in the density of furled leaves used by T. tricolor for roosting. Finca had more leaves per hectare (77), followed by Ureña (58), and Esquinas (7). The time period over which the probability of association is halved based on fitted models was 1,086 days for Finca, 714 days for Ureña, and 303 days for Esquinas. Finca and Ureña had very similar network topologies, with several small clusters, high-clustering coefficients, short path lengths, low node betweenness, and high network robustness. Social networks at Esquinas were composed of one large cluster and several small isolated ones. Esquinas also had high-clustering coefficients, but path length and node betweenness were high. Network resilience was lower in Esquinas compared to Finca and Ureña. These results show that, unlike many other forest-dwelling bats that switch roosts regularly, T. tricolor does not exhibit a typical fission-fusion social system, and that resource availability seems to affect social networks in this bat. In addition, this study highlights the importance of emigrating individuals in maintaining social cohesion, establishing network connectedness, and determining network robustness. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Association patterns; Cooperation; Lagged association rates; Network robustness; Roost density; Social network","bat; comparative study; cooperative behavior; dicotyledon; ecological modeling; forest ecosystem; leaf; network analysis; resource availability; roosting; social network; Thyroptera tricolor; Urena",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956728253

Knowledge of the degree to which individuals are stable in their social behavior can improve our understanding the fitness consequences of processes such as the transmission of disease and social information through networks, as well as the evolution of social behavior and social structure in general. Here, I investigated individual consistency in social behavior in wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerthrus) residing in a highly seasonal habitat. I constructed grooming networks for three time periods characterized by diverse environmental conditions and explored the repeatability of seven network metrics as well as the effects of sex and dominance rank on these metrics. Both female and male vervets were highly consistent in three correlated, weighted measures of social connectedness—grooming in-strength, out-strength, and eigenvector centrality, and in-degree was moderately repeatable in both sexes. In contrast, only males were consistent in their out-degree and clustering coefficient, and there was no evidence of consistency in betweenness for either sex. High-ranking females had higher in-degree and in-strength scores, and high-ranking males had lower out-degree and out-strength, but controlling for dominance rank did not affect the findings regarding the repeatability of any metric. These results add to the small number of studies that have explored the temporal and situational stability of social network phenotypes in wild animals. Significance statement: Relatively few animal social network studies have examined whether individuals are consistent in the positions that they occupy within networks. Determining the degree to which individuals are consistent in their social network characteristics over time and across naturally changing conditions is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology and evolution of social behavior. In this study, I examined individual consistency in several components of social network position in vervet monkeys residing in a highly seasonal environment. I also evaluated the effects of sex and dominance rank on these measures of sociality. I found that both male and female vervets were consistent in most measures of direct connectedness in grooming networks across seasons, but metrics capturing indirect social connections were overall less repeatable. Controlling for the effects of dominance rank on sociality measures did not change these results. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Behavioral consistency; Chlorocebus pygerythrus; Repeatability; Seasonal changes; Sociability; Social behavior","breeding population; dominance; environmental change; environmental conditions; fitness; grooming; primate; seasonal variation; social network; social structure; Animalia; Cercopithecus; Cercopithecus pygerythrus; Primates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039917182

This can be a problem because it does not adjust for any bias in effect sizes generated by these confounding effects, and thus the effect sizes are not informative in the presence of confounding variables. We implemented two network simulation examples and analysed an empirical dataset to demonstrate how relying solely on permutations to control for confounding variables can result in highly biased effect size estimates of animal social preferences that are uninformative when quantifying differences in behaviour. Using these simulations, we show that this can sometimes even lead to effect sizes that have the wrong sign and are thus the effect size is not biologically interpretable. We demonstrate how this problem can be addressed by controlling for confounding variables in the statistical dyadic or nodal model.

Network analysis provides a flexible toolbox for testing a broad range of hypotheses, and for describing the social system of species or populations in a quantitative and comparable manner. However, it requires careful consideration of underlying assumptions, in particular differentiating real from observed networks and controlling for inherent biases that are common in social data. We provide a practical guide for using this framework to analyse animal social systems and test hypotheses. First, we discuss key considerations when defining nodes and edges, and when designing methods for collecting data. We discuss different approaches for inferring social networks from these data and displaying them. We then provide an overview of methods for quantifying properties of nodes and networks, as well as for testing hypotheses concerning network structure and network processes. Finally, we provide information about assessing the power and accuracy of an observed network. Alongside this manuscript, we provide appendices containing background information on common programming routines and worked examples of how to perform network analysis using the r programming language. We conclude by discussing some of the major current challenges in social network analysis and interesting future directions.

To our knowledge this is the first study to provide replication of social networks and therefore probably the first that allows general conclusions to be drawn. The social networks were all found to have a non-random structure and exhibited 'social cliquishness'. A number of factors were observed to contribute to this structuring. Firstly, social network structure was influenced by body length and shoaling tendency, with individuals interacting more frequently with conspecifics of similar body length and shoaling tendency. Secondly, individuals with many social contacts were found to interact with each other more often than with other conspecifics, a phenomenon known as a 'positive degree correlation'. Finally, repeated interactions between pairs of individuals occurred within the networks more often than expected by random interactions. The observed network structures will have ecological and evolutionary implications. For example, the occurrence of positive degree correlations suggests the possibility that pathogens and information (that are socially transmitted) could spread very fast within the populations. Furthermore, the occurrence of repeated interactions between pairs of individuals fulfils an important pre-requisite for the evolution of reciprocal altruism. © Springer-Verlag 2005.","Group living; Guppies; Social organisation; Sticklebacks","body size; fish; schooling behavior; social network; social organization; animal; animal behavior; article; body size; Canada; comparative study; Cyprinodontiformes; physiology; Smegmamorpha; social behavior; Trinidad and Tobago; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Body Size; New Brunswick; Poecilia; Smegmamorpha; Social Behavior; Trinidad and Tobago",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17044385051

By doing so, we aim to stimulate the development and implementation of practical tools for wildlife conservation and management and to inspire novel behavioral research in this field.

However, infectious disease spread is driven primarily by the social organization of interactions in a group and not its size. We used statistical models to review the social network organization of 47 species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and insects by categorizing each species into one of three social systems, relatively solitary, gregarious and socially hierarchical. Additionally, using computational experiments of infection spread, we determined the disease costs of each social system. We find that relatively solitary species have large variation in number of social partners, that socially hierarchical species are the least clustered in their interactions, and that social networks of gregarious species tend to be the most fragmented. However, these structural differences are primarily driven by weak connections, which suggest that different social systems have evolved unique strategies to organize weak ties. Our synthetic disease experiments reveal that social network organization can mitigate the disease costs of group living for socially hierarchical species when the pathogen is highly transmissible. In contrast, highly transmissible pathogens cause frequent and prolonged epidemic outbreaks in gregarious species. We evaluate the implications of network organization across social systems despite methodological challenges, and our findings offer new perspective on the debate about the disease costs of group living. Additionally, our study demonstrates the potential of meta-analytic methods in social network analysis to test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses on cooperation, group living, communication and resilience to extrinsic pressures. © 2017 The Authors.

This study was conducted to determine the utility of social network analysis for deciphering patterns of aggression and wounding in rhesus macaques. Over 37,000 observations of affiliative, submissive and aggressive activities were collected over a 3-year period on ∼1300 rhesus macaques housed in 13.2 ha enclosures. Data also were analyzed on management factors such as age/sex composition and matriline configuration that might promote or reduce aggression in rhesus macaques. Results suggest that social network measures such as subordination degree (social power), displacement fragmentation and groom reciprocity within social groups were not only significantly associated with rates of contact aggression and wounding but with the occurrence of severe aggressive outbreaks, known as cage wars. In addition, groups with a lower proportion of adult females and a more uniform distribution in the number of individuals across matrilines exhibited higher social power and lower fragmentation. These data indicate that by manipulating group composition and matriline configuration of social groups to promote social cohesion and stability, behavioral managers may be able to reduce the level of aggression and aggression-based morbidity and mortality. These data also show that social network measures are valuable predictors of deleterious aggression and even cage wars indicating that such measures could be used to longitudinally track changes in social dynamics to detect significant instabilities, allowing managers to prevent severe outbreaks before they occur in populations of rhesus macaques and perhaps other non-human primate species. © 2006.","Aggression; Behavior management; Demographics; Macaque; Primate well-being; Social network analysis","aggression; demography; fragmentation; morbidity; mortality; network analysis; primate; social network; wounding; Macaca; Macaca mulatta; Primates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37349012613

We conducted a field experiment to investigate how sickness behavior affects individual connectedness over time using a dynamic social network created from high-resolution proximity data. After capturing adult female vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from a roost, we created ""sick""bats by injecting a random half of bats with the immune-challenging substance, lipopolysaccharide, while the control group received saline injections. Over the next 3 days, we used proximity sensors to continuously track dyadic associations between 16 ""sick""bats and 15 control bats under natural conditions. Compared to control bats, ""sick""bats associated with fewer bats, spent less time near others, and were less socially connected to more well-connected individuals (sick bats had on average a lower degree, strength, and eigenvector centrality). High-resolution proximity data allow researchers to flexibly define network connections (association rates) based on how a particular pathogen is transmitted (e.g., contact duration of >1 vs. >60 min, contact proximity of <1 vs. <10 m). Therefore, we inspected how different ways of measuring association rates changed the observed effect of LPS. How researchers define association rates influences the magnitude and detectability of sickness effects on network centrality. When animals are sick, they often encounter fewer individuals. We tracked this unintentional ""social distancing""effect hour-by-hour in a wild colony of vampire bats. Using bat-borne proximity sensors, we compared changes in the social network connectedness of immune-challenged ""sick""bats versus ""control""bats over time. ""Sick""bats had fewer encounters with others and spent less time near others. Associations changed dramatically by time of day, and different measures of association influenced the sickness effect estimates. © 2020 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the International Society for Behavioral Ecology 2020.","Biologging; Desmodus rotundus; Disease; Dynamic network; Lipopolysaccharide; Pathogen transmission","bat; colony; experimental study; immune system; pathogenicity; roosting; sensory system; social network; Desmodus rotundus",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096099025

Whilst a significant amount of theoretical work has modelled disease transmission using network models, we have comparatively little understanding of how infectious disease impacts on the social behaviour of individuals and how these effects scale up to the level of the population. We experimentally manipulated the parasite load of female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) and introduced fish either infected with the ectoparasites Gyrodactylus spp. (experimental) or uninfected (control) into replicated semi-natural populations of eight size-matched female guppies. We quantified the behaviour and social associations of both the introduced fish and the population fish. We found that infected experimental fish spent less time associating with the population fish than the uninfected control fish. Using information on which fish initiated shoal fission (splitting) events, our results demonstrate that the population fish actively avoided infected experimental fish. We also found that the presence of an infected individual resulted in a continued decline in social network clustering up to at least 24 h after the introduction of the infected fish, whereas in the control treatment, the clustering coefficient showed an increase at this time point. These results demonstrate that the presence of a disease has implications for both the social associations of infected individuals and for the social network structure of the population, which we predict will have consequences for infectious disease transmission. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Disease transmission; Group living; Infection; Parasite transmission; Shoaling; Social networks; Social organisation","cluster analysis; cyprinid; disease transmission; ectoparasite; host-parasite interaction; infectious disease; social network; social organization; social structure; theoretical study; Cyprinodontiformes; Gyrodactylidae; Gyrodactylus; Poecilia reticulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80955142958

Consequently, evidence relating to the causal processes underlying such networks is limited. By imposing specified rules controlling individual access to feeding stations, we directly manipulated the foraging social network of a wild bird community, thus demonstrating how external factors can shape social structure. We show that experimentally imposed constraints were carried over into patterns of association at unrestricted, ephemeral food patches, as well as at nesting sites during breeding territory prospecting. Hence, different social contexts can be causally linked, and constraints at one level may have consequences that extend into other aspects of sociality. Finally, the imposed assortment was lost following the cessation of the experimental manipulation, indicating the potential for previously perturbed social networks of wild animals to recover from segregation driven by external constraints. © 2015 The Authors.","Associations; Assortativity; Paridae; Resilience; Social interactions; Social network","avifauna; bird; eusociality; experimental study; social network; social structure; wild population; Animalia; Aves; Paridae; animal; animal behavior; England; feeding behavior; nesting; Passeriformes; physiology; social behavior; Animals; Behavior, Animal; England; Feeding Behavior; Nesting Behavior; Passeriformes; Social Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922356399

We found that the network was generally robust to the removal of nodes with high centrality. The network appeared also highly robust to experimental fishing. Individual shark catchability decreased as a function of experience, as revealed by comparing capture frequency and site presence. Altogether, these features suggest that individuals learnt to avoid capture, which ultimately increased network robustness to experimental catch-And-release. Our results also suggest that some caution must be taken when using capture-recapture models often used to assess population size as assumptions (such as equal probabilities of capture and recapture) may be violated by individual learning to escape recapture. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

As such, network analysis has been used frequently to identify the role that particular individuals play in their social interactions and this approach has led to the question of whether, and in what context, individuals consistently occupy certain positions within their network. Here we investigated the social networks of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, in the wild and tested whether 1) individual fish occupy consistent positions in their network and 2) whether these positions are robust to experimental manipulations to their habitat. Our habitat manipulations involved increasing and decreasing the surface area of their pools as well as translocating an entire pool population between different pools in situ. We found that guppies did indeed consistently occupy positions within their social networks, irrespective of the type of manipulation and that individual network positions vary between individuals. Our results suggest that at least 2 factors contribute to the observed individual variation in network position including 1) the tendency to be social and 2) sex-specific social preferences. Finally, we used a simulation to explore the implications of individuals consistently occupying different network positions regarding the exposure of fish to parasites and predators. The time until infection decreased with increasing rank of individual betweenness and the predation risk increased with decreasing rank of the individual node strength thus illustrating the potential ecological and evolutionary consequences of consistent network positions. © 2016 The Author(s).","Environmental change; Habitat manipulation; Network position; Social network analysis","cyprinid; environmental change; habitat restoration; habitat selection; individual variation; network analysis; predation risk; sex-related difference; social network; Animalia; Poecilia reticulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020210564

We apply this technique to explore the social structure and social roles of 50 Livingstone’s fruit bats (Pteropus livingstonii) housed at Jersey Zoo, Channel Islands, through the observation of associative, affiliative, and aggressive interactions over two data collection periods. We implement binomial mixture modelling and characteristic-based assortment quantification to describe the complexity and organisation of social networks, as well as a multiple regression quadratic assignment procedural (MRQAP) test to analyse the relationship between network types. We examine the effects of individual characteristics (i.e., sex, age, and dominance rank) on social role by fitting models to explain the magnitude of node metrics. Additionally, we utilize a quadratic assignment procedural (QAP) test to assess the temporal stability of social roles over two seasons. Our results indicate that P. livingstonii display a non-random network structure. Observed social networks are positively assorted by age, as well as dominance rank. The frequency of association between individuals correlates with a higher frequency of behavioural interactions, both affiliative and aggressive. Individual social roles remain consistent over ten months. We recommend that, to improve welfare and captive breeding success, relationships between individuals of similar ages and dominance levels should be allowed to persist in this group where possible, and separating individuals that interact frequently in an affiliative context should be avoided. © 2020 by the authors.

Herein we use a combination of graph theoretic and spatial approaches to describe the roost and social network characteristics and foraging associations of an Indiana bat (Myotis sodalis) maternity colony in an agricultural landscape in Ohio, USA. We tracked 46 bats to 50 roosts (423 total relocations) and collected 2,306 foraging locations for 40 bats during the summers of 2009 and 2010. We found the colony roosting network was highly centralized in both years and that roost and social networks differed significantly from random networks. Roost and social network structure also differed substantially between years. Social network structure appeared to be unrelated to segregation of roosts between age classes. For bats whose individual foraging ranges were calculated, many shared foraging space with at least one other bat. Compared across all possible bat dyads, 47% and 43% of the dyads showed more than expected overlap of foraging areas in 2009 and 2010 respectively. Colony roosting area differed between years, but the roosting area centroid shifted only 332 m. In contrast, whole colony foraging area use was similar between years. Random roost removal simulations suggest that Indiana bat colonies may be robust to loss of a limited number of roosts but may respond differently from year to year.

We explored the social behaviour of the Otago skink (Oligosoma otagense), one of New Zealand’s largest and rarest species of lizards. The Otago skink has previously been observed in the wild in pairs and groups, but little else is known about its social behaviour. We studied the social behaviour of a translocated population of 32 skinks in an outdoor enclosure at Ōrokonui Ecosanctuary. Regular photo surveys were conducted from November 2017 to October 2018 to identify skinks and the social interactions among them. Skinks were observed to be either solitary or interacting in groups consisting of two to eight individuals. Social network analysis was used to determine the strength of the interactions between adult males, adult females, subadults and juveniles. We assessed the stability of social interactions in the population over time by comparing the persistence of social interactions between seasons (summer, autumn/winter and winter/spring) while taking into account the size and composition of a social group. Interactions between adults and subadults were stable across autumn/winter and winter/spring whereas juveniles showed no stability in their interaction patterns during this time. During the course of the study, there was an overall stability in the social networks, indicating that the stability of social interactions present in the translocated population is largely driven by the adults and subadults in the enclosure. Our work suggests that incorporating an understanding of sociality into capture procedures may minimise disruption to social structures and ultimately improve outcomes of translocation. © 2021 New Zealad Ecological Society.","Social behaviour; Social network analysis; Translocated population; Ōrokonui Ecosanctuary","lizard; reptile; seasonal variation; social behavior; social network; social structure; spatiotemporal analysis; translocation; New Zealand; Orokonui Ecosanctuary; Otago; South Island; Oligosoma otagense; Scincidae; Squamata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102602201

While the null models of binary networks are well studied, recent literature on weighted networks suggests that: (1) many so-called 'weighted metrics' do not actually depend on weights, and (2) many metrics that supposedly measure higher-order social structure actually are highly correlated with individual-level attributes. This is important for behavioural ecology studies where weighted network analyses predominate, but there is no consensus on how null models should be specified. Using real social networks, we developed three null models that address two technical challenges in the networks of social animals: (1) how to specify null models that are suitable for 'proportion-weighted networks' based on indices such as the half-weight index; and (2) how to condition on the degree- and strength-sequence and both. We compared 11 metrics with each other and against null-model expectations for 10 social networks of bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops aduncus, from Shark Bay, Australia. Observed metric values were similar to null-model expectations for some weighted metrics, such as centrality measures, disparity and connectivity, whereas other metrics such as affinity and clustering were informative about dolphin social structure. Because weighted metrics can differ in their sensitivity to the degree-sequence or strength-sequence, conditioning on both is a more reliable and conservative null model than the more common strength-preserving null-model for weighted networks. Other social structure analyses, such as community partitioning by weighted Modularity optimization, were much less sensitive to the underlying null-model. Lastly, in contrast to results in other scientific disciplines, we found that many weighted metrics do not depend trivially on topology; rather, the weight distribution contains important information about dolphin social structure. © 2015 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Bias; Bottlenose dolphin; Community structure; Maximum entropy; Network topology; Social network","Animalia; Chondrichthyes; Tursiops; Tursiops aduncus",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957106497

Largely considered to be driven by immediate benefits, such as avoiding predators, animal groups often consist of individuals that are phenotypically more similar than expected from the population distribution. This suggests that the distribution and fitness of phenotypes may be shaped by multiple levels of selection operating along different axes of behaviour. Thus, quantifying assortative mixing, or the measure of association between similar individuals in social networks, should be a key component of the biologist's toolbox. Yet, assortment is rarely tested in animal social networks. This may be driven by a lack of tools for robust estimation of assortment, given the reliance of current methods on binary networks. In this paper, I extend existing approaches that calculate the assortativity coefficient of both nominal classes and continuous traits to incorporate weighted associations. I have made these available through a new R package 'assortnet'. I use simulated networks to show that weighted assortment coefficients are more robust than those calculated on binary networks to added noise that could arise from random interactions or sampling errors. Finally, I demonstrate how these methods differ by applying them to two existing social networks estimated from wild populations, exploring assortment by species, sex and network degree. Given the parallel theoretical developments of the importance of local social structure on population processes, and increasing data on social networks being collected in free-living populations, understanding phenotypic assortment could yield significant insight into social evolution. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Assortativity; Assortnet; Group living; Niche partitioning; Paridae; R package; Social evolution; Social organization",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893478650

In a series of simulation experiments based on dynamic social networks, we test the prediction that social behaviors that help individuals reach prominence within their social group may conflict with their potential to benefit from their social environment. In addition to cases where individuals were able to benefit from improving both their personal relative importance and group organization, using only simple rules of social affiliation we were able to obtain results in which individuals would face a trade-off between these factors. While selection would favor (or work against) social behaviors that concordantly increase (or decrease, respectively) fitness at both individual and group level, when these factors conflict with each other the eventual selective pressure would depend on the relative returns individuals get from their social environment and their position within it. The presented results highlight the importance of a systems approach to studying animal sociality, in which the effects of social behaviors should be viewed not only through the benefits that those provide to individuals, but also in terms of how they affect broader social environment and how in turn this is reflected back on an individual's fitness. © 2010 Hock et al.",,"animal behavior; article; conflict; controlled study; nonhuman; prediction; process model; social attitude; social behavior; social class; social dominance; social environment; social interaction; social network; social structure; socialization; system analysis; algorithm; animal; biological model; computer simulation; methodology; social environment; social support; statistical model; systems biology; time; Animalia; Algorithms; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Computer Simulation; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Social Behavior; Social Environment; Social Support; Systems Biology; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650845683

Disturbance events often alter habitat, which in turn can modify behaviors of individuals in affected areas, including changes in habitat use and associated changes in social structure. To better understand these relationships, we investigated aspects of habitat selection and social connectivity of a small passerine bird, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus), before vs. after naturally occurring fire disturbance in Northern Territory, Australia. We utilized a social network framework to evaluate changes in social dynamics pre- vs. post-fire. Our study covered the non-breeding season in two consecutive years in which fires occurred, and individuals whose habitat was affected and those that were not affected by fire. Individuals in habitat affected by fires had stronger social ties (i.e. higher weighted degree) after fires, while those that were in areas that were not affected by fire actually had lower weighted degree. We suggest that this change in social connections may be linked to habitat. Before fires, fairywrens used habitat that had similar grass cover to available habitat plots randomly generated within our study site. Fire caused a reduction in grass cover, and fairywrens responded by selecting habitat with higher grass cover relative to random plots. This study demonstrates how changes in habitat and/or resource availability caused by disturbance can lead to substantive changes in the social environment that individuals experience. © 2017 Lantz, Karubian.

Assessing elements of animal behaviour under domesticated conditions in comparison to natural behaviours found in wild settings has the potential to address issues of animal welfare effectively, such as focusing on reproduction and production success. This review discusses and evaluates to what extent social network analysis (SNA) can be incorporated with sensor-based data collection methods, and what impact the results may have concerning welfare assessment and future farm management processes. The effectiveness and critical features of automated sensor-based technologies deployed in farms include tools for measuring animal social group interactions and the monitoring and recording of farm animal behaviour using SNA. Comparative analyses between the quality of sensor-collected data and traditional observa-tional methods provide an enhanced understanding of the behavioural dynamics of farm animals. The effectiveness of sensor-based approaches in data collection for farm animal behaviour measure-ment offers unique opportunities for social network research. Sensor-enabled data in livestock SNA addresses the biological aspects of animal behaviour via remote real-time data collection, and the results both directly and indirectly influence welfare assessments, and farm management processes. Finally, we conclude with potential implications of SNA on modern animal farming for improvement of animal welfare. © 2021 by the authors.

Ecological marine protected areas (MPAs) focus on restoring or maintaining marine populations, communities, or ecosystems. All ecological MPAs – no matter their specific focus or objectives – depend for their success on incorporating ecological spatial connectivity into their design, use (i.e. application), and management. Though important, a synthesis of the implications of ecological spatial connectivity for the design, use, and management of MPAs, especially in the face of a changing global climate, does not exist. We synthesize this information and distill it into practical principles for design, use, and management of MPAs and networks of MPAs. High population connectivity among distant coastal ecosystems underscores the critical value of MPA networks for MPAs and the populations and ecosystems between them. High ecosystem connectivity among coastal ecosystems underscores the importance of protecting multiple connected ecosystems within an MPA, maximizing ecosystem connectivity across MPAs, and managing ecosystems outside MPAs so as to minimize influxes of detrimental organisms and materials into MPAs. Connectivity-informed MPAs and MPA networks – designed and managed to foster the ecological spatial connectivity processes important to local populations, species, communities, and ecosystems – can best address ecological changes induced by climate change. Also, the protections afforded by MPAs from direct, local human impacts may ameliorate climate change impacts in coastal ecosystems inside MPAs and, indirectly, in ecosystems outside MPAs.

Through social network analysis, we understand that wild animal and livestock populations, including farmed fish and poultry, often have a heterogeneous contact structure owing to social structure or trade networks. Network modelling is a flexible tool used to capture the heterogeneous contacts of a population in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of disease transmission, simulate and predict disease spread, and test disease control strategies. This review highlights how to use animal contact data, including social networks, for network modelling, and emphasizes that researchers should have a pathogen of interest in mind before collecting or using contact data. This paper describes the rising popularity of network approaches for understanding transmission dynamics in wild animal and livestock populations; discusses the common mismatch between contact networks as measured in animal behaviour and relevant parasites to match those networks; and highlights knowledge gaps in how to collect and analyse contact data.

In the 1990s, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Moreton Bay, Australia, formed two distinct social communities ('trawler' and 'nontrawler dolphins') based on foraging interactions (or lack thereof) with commercial prawn trawlers. Members of the two communities almost never associated, despite overlapping home ranges. Since then, changes to fisheries legislation have substantially reduced trawling in Moreton Bay. We used association analyses and social network metrics to compare patterns of sociality among bottlenose dolphins across two periods: 1997-1999 (during trawling) and 2008-2010 (post trawling). Over this decade, their social network became less differentiated and more compact (average geodesic distance between individuals decreased), with significantly more and stronger associations between individuals (mean and maximum half-weight indices increased). The previously described partitioning into two communities has disappeared, with former 'trawler' and 'nontrawler dolphins' now dispersed over the entire social network and associating with each other. This restructuring suggests that although fisheries can influence the social behaviour of bottlenose dolphins, their social structure represents a complex adaptive system that is resilient to disturbance. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Bottlenose dolphin; Disturbance; Fisheries; Resilience; Social network; Social structure; Tursiops aduncus","commercial species; disturbance; dolphin; ecosystem resilience; fishery regulation; fishing industry; foraging behavior; home range; human activity; social network; trawling; Australia; Moreton Bay; Queensland; Animalia; Tursiops; Tursiops aduncus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865394353

Starting as merely supporting evidence found in rodents, the use of fish models has slowly taken a more central role and expanded its overall contributions in areas such as social sciences, evolution, physiology and recently in translational medical research. In the neurosciences, zebrafish Danio rerio have been widely adopted, contributing to our understanding of the genetic control of brain processes and the effects of pharmacological manipulations. However, discussion continues regarding the paradox of function versus structure, when fishes and mammals are compared and on the potentially evolutionarily conserved nature of behaviour across fish species. From a behavioural standpoint, we explore aversive–stress and social behaviour in selected fish models and refer to the extensive contributions of stress and monoaminergic systems. We suggest that, in spite of marked neuroanatomical differences between fishes and mammals, stress and sociality are conserved at the behavioural and molecular levels. We also suggest that stress and sociality are mediated by monoamines in predictable and non-trivial ways and that monoamines could bridge the relationship between stress and social behaviour. To reconcile the level of divergence with the level of similarity, we need neuroanatomical, pharmacological, behavioural and ecological studies conducted in the laboratory and in nature. These areas need to add to each other to enhance our understanding of fish behaviour and ultimately how this all may lead to better model systems for translational studies. © 2018 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles","aversive behaviour network; mesolimbic reward system; neuroendocrinology; social behaviour network","biogenic amine; dopamine; serotonin; animal; animal model; brain; coping behavior; mental stress; neuroendocrinology; neuroscience; pathophysiology; physiology; social behavior; trends; zebra fish; Adaptation, Psychological; Animals; Biogenic Monoamines; Brain; Dopamine; Models, Animal; Neuroendocrinology; Neurosciences; Serotonin; Social Behavior; Stress, Psychological; Zebrafish",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053598861

Cooperation among nonkin is generally predicted to be favoured in structured social networks where individuals primarily interact only with certain individuals. Long-tailed manakins, Chiroxiphia linearis, form lek groups of as many as 15 unrelated males, whose members can attend multiple leks. At each lek, several top-ranked males perform the majority of obligate cooperative courtship displays. We used exponential random graph (ERG) modelling to analyse manakin cooperation networks constructed from 2-year time intervals over a 14-year study period. ERG modelling evaluates how local processes contribute to formation of global social network structure. We found that four local processes of link formation largely explained the overall structure of male manakin cooperation networks: (1) the spatial proximity of birds: males were more likely to cooperate if they primarily displayed at the same or neighbouring leks; (2) social status of birds: males were more likely to cooperate as they moved up the social queue at leks; (3) triad closure: males were more likely to cooperate with a 'friend of a friend' than with males with which they did not share a mutual partner; and (4) link persistence: males were more likely to cooperate with males whom they had cooperated with in the past. Other plausible mechanisms, such as selective mixing (the tendency to interact with individuals of similar or dissimilar social status) and preferential attachment by degree (whereby individuals with many social links gain additional links) did not consistently explain the structure of male cooperation networks at leks. These local processes may facilitate cooperation among long-tailed manakins by creating structured social networks in which males interact with only a subset of the population. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","modelling; Cooperation; Dyad; Exponential random graph; Graph theory; P; Social bond; Triad closure","cooperative breeding; disease spread; lek; male behavior; passerine; social network",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907874345

Why then should organisms invest in cooperative partnerships with nonkin, if kin relationships are available and more beneficial? One explanation is that a kin-limited support network is too small and risky. Even if additional weaker partnerships reduce immediate net cooperative returns, individuals extending cooperation to nonkin can maintain a larger social network which reduces the potential costs associated with losing a primary cooperation partner. Just as financial or evolutionary bethedging strategies can reduce risk, investing in quantity of social relationships at the expense of relationship quality ('social bet-hedging') can reduce the risks posed by unpredictable social environments. Here, we provide evidence for social bet-hedging in food-sharing vampire bats. When we experimentally removed a key food-sharing partner, females that previously fed a greater number of unrelated females suffered a smaller reduction in food received. Females that invested in more nonkin bonds did not do better under normal conditions, but they coped better with partner loss. Hence, loss of a key partner revealed the importance ofweaker nonkin bonds. Social bet-hedging can have important implications for social network structure by influencing how individuals form relationships. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Investigating the role of central individuals within a network may help predict infectious agent transmission as well as implement disease control strategies, but little is known about such dynamics in real primate networks. We combined social network analysis and a modeling approach to better understand transmission of a theoretical infectious agent in wild Japanese macaques, highly social animals which form extended but highly differentiated social networks. We collected focal data from adult females living on the islands of Koshima and Yakushima, Japan. Individual identities as well as grooming networks were included in a Markov graph-based simulation. In this model, the probability that an individual will transmit an infectious agent depends on the strength of its relationships with other group members. Similarly, its probability of being infected depends on its relationships with already infected group members. We correlated: (i) the percentage of subjects infected during a latency-constrained epidemic; (ii) the mean latency to complete transmission; (iii) the probability that an individual is infected first among all group members; and (iv) each individual's mean rank in the chain of transmission with different individual network centralities (eigenvector, strength, betweenness). Our results support the hypothesis that more central individuals transmit infections in a shorter amount of time and to more subjects but also become infected more quickly than less central individuals. However, we also observed that the spread of infectious agents on the Yakushima network did not always differ from expectations of spread on random networks. Generalizations about the importance of observed social networks in pathogen flow should thus be made with caution, since individual characteristics in some real world networks appear less relevant than they are in others in predicting disease spread.

Previous research has suggested that exposure to stress during development causes differences in social behaviour later in life. In captivity, juvenile zebra finches exposed to elevated corticosterone levels were less socially choosy and more central in their social networks when compared to untreated siblings. These differences extended to other aspects of social life, with ‘stress-exposed’ juveniles switching social learning strategies and juvenile males less faithfully learning their father’s song. However, while this body of research suggests that the impacts of early-life stress could be profound, it remains unknown whether such effects are strong enough to be expressed under natural conditions. Here, we collected data on social associations of zebra finches in the Australian desert after experimentally manipulating brood sizes. Juveniles from enlarged broods experienced heightened sibling competition, and we predicted that they would express similar patterns of social associations to stress-treated birds in the captive study by having more, but less differentiated, relationships. We show striking support for the suggested consequences of developmental stress on social network positions, with our data from the wild replicating the same results in 9 out of 10 predictions previously tested in captivity. Chicks raised in enlarged broods foraged with greater numbers of conspecifics but were less ‘choosy’ and more central in the social network. Our results confirm that the natural range of variation in early-life experience can be sufficient to predict individuals’ social trajectories and support theory highlighting the potential importance of developmental conditions on behaviour. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Although many SNA-based techniques have been only very recently adopted in primatological research, others have been commonly used by primatologists for decades. The roots of SNA also stem from some of the same conceptual frameworks as the majority of nonhuman primate behavioral research. The rapid development of SNA in recent years has led to questions within the primatological community of where and how SNA fits within this field. We aim to address these questions by providing an overview of the historical relationship between SNA and the study of nonhuman primates.

The intent of the FIP model is to allow fisheries that currently do not meet the MSC standard to maintain market access while working on credible improvements. As such, FIPs have become a widely promoted approach to sustainable fisheries and have proliferated around the globe. Based on recent research assessing the impact of FIPs and testing various FIP attributes and their link to FIP performance, it seems that the FIP model may be delivering on its promise overall. However, the impact of FIP are at best based correlation rather than causation, with only few FIP attributes having been measured consistently over a significant period of time. In this theoretical contribution, we bring attention to one attribute of FIPs: the structure of their social network and its implication for social capital and successful collective action. We start by describing FIPs as projects located at the intersection of environmental governance networks and value chain network governance. Secondly, we demonstrate FIPs as complex social networks and the link between network attributes and FIP progress through the concept of social capital. Thirdly, we present the method of social network analysis and relevant network attributes to understand and characterize how FIPs work better. Finally, we suggest opportunities for further research and integration of this approach in planning and designing FIPs. Through this work, we wish to bring attention to one type of FIP attributes that is currently not explicitly being taken into account to current FIP practitioner and researchers.

Specifically, stressed or otherwise more aroused individuals will produce alarm calls that are relatively more nonlinear (i.e. they sound noisier). The position of an individual in a social network can influence an individual's sense of security. More centrally located individuals may feel more secure and thus we might expect that they would produce noisier calls. Building on previous research about the influence of social relationships on an individual's sense of security, we asked whether social network position explained variation in the noisiness (quantified as Wiener entropy) and goodness of pitch of alarm calls produced by trapped yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. More socially isolated individuals, characterized by lower outstrength, produced alarm calls with higher entropy and higher goodness of pitch. These isolated individuals may be more aroused because they have fewer social partners to depend on when presented with a predatory threat; therefore, they produce both noisy and potentially louder calls. Additionally, individuals with higher outcloseness produced calls with higher goodness of pitch, which may be indicative of their ability to better inform neighbours of impending threats. Overall, this study further illustrates how an individual's social network position influences the structure of its alarm calls, which could reflect how individuals perceive their current safety levels. © 2019","acoustic analysis; alarm calling; centrality; security; social attribute; social network; yellow-bellied marmots","Animalia; Marmota; Marmota flaviventris",Erratum,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078784926

One behavioral difference between birds living in urban and rural habitats is that urban males show elevated boldness or territorial aggression in response to simulated social challenge. This pattern has been described in several populations of song sparrow, Melospiza melodia. Such behavioral differences must be underpinned by differences in the brain, yet little work has explored how urbanization and neural function may be interrelated. We explored the relationship between urbanization and neural activation within a network of brain regions, collectively called the social behavior network, which contributes to the regulation of territorial aggression. Specifically, we captured free-living, territorial male song sparrows by playing them conspecific songs for 6-11 min, and then collected their brains. We estimated recent neural activation, as indicated by the immediate early gene FOS, and measured levels of a neuropeptide, arginine vasotocin (AVT), which is involved in the regulation of social behavior. Based on previous studies we expected urban males, which are generally more territorially aggressive, to have lower FOS expression in a node of the social behavior network implicated in regulating territoriality, the lateral septum (LS). Additionally, we expected urban males to have lower AVT expression in a brain region involved in the regulation of sociality, the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTm). We found that, compared to rural males, urban male song sparrows did have lower FOS expression in the LS. This pattern suggests that lower neural activation in the LS could contribute to behavioral adjustments to urbanization in male song sparrows. Additionally, counter to our predictions, urban male song sparrows had higher AVT-like immunoreactivity in the BSTm.

At the heart of this conflict in a number of taxa is male harassment of females for mating opportunities and female strategies to avoid this harassment. One neglected consequence that may result from sexual harassment is the disruption of important social associations. Here, we experimentally manipulate the degree of sexual harassment that wild female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) experience by establishing replicated, semi-natural pools with different population sex ratios. We quantify the effects of sexual harassment on female social structure and the development of social recognition among females. When exposed to sexual harassment, we found that females had more disparate social networks with limited repeated interactions when compared to females that did not experience male harassment. Furthermore, females that did not experience harassment developed social recognition with familiar individuals over an 8-day period, whereas females that experienced harassment did not, an effect we suggest is due to disruption of association patterns. These results show that social network structure and social recognition can be affected by sexual harassment, an effect that will be relevant across taxonomic groups and that we predict will have fitness consequences for females. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Familiarity; Poecilia reticulata; Sexual conflict; Sexual harassment; Social network; Social recognition","aggression; familiarity; recognition; sexual conflict; sexual reproduction; social behavior; social network; teleost; animal experiment; article; association; female; freshwater fish; guppy; male; nonhuman; priority journal; sex ratio; sexism; sexual harassment; social aspect; social behavior; social interaction; social network; social recognition; social structure; Poecilia reticulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650453990

To mitigate these risks, individuals often modify behaviour, e.g. reducing activity and seeking shade. These behavioural modifications may affect interactions between individuals, with consequences for the social structure of groups. We tested whether the social structure of cooperative groups of sociable weavers Philetairus socius varied with environmental temperature. We recorded the nature and frequency of interactions at feeders positioned beneath three sociable weaver colonies (n = 49 identified birds) in the Kalahari Desert with respect to environmental temperatures over a 30-day period. Using random forest models, we examined whether thermal conditions predicted variation in social network structure. We also conducted focal observations of individual weavers to assess functional links between temperature, intensity of heat dissipation behaviour (panting) and immediate effects on social behaviour. Our results suggest that the social structure of weaver colonies becomes less cohesive and more fragmented at extreme and variable environmental temperatures. These changes in network structure appear to be linked with individuals’ heat dissipation behaviour: extreme and variable temperatures were associated with increased panting, which was significantly correlated with an immediate reduction in the frequency of association. Collectively, our results indicate that interactions within groups could be disturbed by environmental temperature variation and extremes. Changing temperature regimes could therefore affect the functioning of animal societies by altering social networks. © 2020 Nordic Society Oikos.

Here we studied temporal changes in network structure and social relationships in experimentally perturbed social hierarchies of the cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni. By removing a dominant male in replicate groups, we triggered more status changes compared to control, subordinate male removal groups. At the individual level, we found that dominant male removal resulted in dominant males significantly increasing the rate of chases (‘chase strength’), but there was no significant increase in the rate of display (‘display strength’). Dominant male removal also led to several changes at the group level: network reciprocity and network stability decreased in response to dominant male removal, while network density was not affected by our treatment. However, in contrast to the individual level network measures, these group level effects were present in display networks but not in chase networks. Display networks mostly connect dominant males within the network, making display networks more sensitive to changes in the hierarchy. Together, our results provide novel insights into complex social dynamics in experimentally altered social dominance networks. © 2021 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","aggression; social network; social rank; territory defence","cichlid; dominance; experimental study; male; reciprocity; social network; temporal variation; Astatotilapia burtoni; Cichlidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103330354

Social aggregation is a special category that refers to groups that self-organize and maintain cohesion to exploit benefits such as protection from predators, and location and capture of resources more effectively and with greater energy efficiency than could a solitary individual. In this review we explore general aggregation principles, with specific reference to pelagic organisms; describe a range of new technologies either designed for studying aggregations or that could potentially be exploited for this purpose; report on the insights gained from theoretical modelling; discuss the relationship between social aggregation and ocean management; and speculate on the impact of climate change. Examples of aggregation occur in all animal phyla. Among pelagic organisms, it is possible that repeated co-occurrence of stable pairs of individuals, which has been established for some schooling fish, is the likely precursor leading to networks of social interaction and more complex social behaviour. Social network analysis has added new insights into social behaviour and allows us to dissect aggregations and to examine how the constituent individuals interact with each other. This type of analysis is well advanced in pinnipeds and cetaceans, and work on fish is progressing. Detailed three-dimensional analysis of schools has proved to be difficult, especially at sea, but there has been some progress recently. The technological aids for studying social aggregation include video and acoustics, and have benefited from advances in digitization, miniaturization, motion analysis and computing power. New techniques permit three-dimensional tracking of thousands of individual animals within a single group which has allowed novel insights to within-group interactions. Approaches using theoretical modelling of aggregations have a long history but only recently have hypotheses been tested empirically. The lack of synchrony between models and empirical data, and lack of a common framework to schooling models have hitherto hampered progress; however, recent developments in this field offer considerable promise. Further, we speculate that climate change, already having effects on ecosystems, could have dramatic effects on aggregations through its influence on species composition by altering distribution ranges, migration patterns, vertical migration, and oceanic acidity. Because most major commercial fishing targets schooling species, these changes could have important consequences for the dependent businesses. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Association; Climate change; Marine; Modelling; Pelagic zone; Social aggregation; Social networks; Technology","acidity; aggregation behavior; cetacean; climate change; commercial activity; digitization; energy efficiency; fishing; invertebrate; marine technology; network analysis; pelagic environment; pelagic fish; pinniped; population distribution; schooling behavior; self organization; social network; synchrony; technological development; vertical migration; Animalia; Cetacea; Invertebrata; Pinnipedia",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053325728

Proximity logging, which involves the use of animal-borne tags with the capacity for two-way communication, has attracted particular attention in recent years. While the basic rationale of proximity logging is straightforward, systems generate very large datasets which pose considerable challenges in terms of processing and visualisation. Technical aspects of data handling are crucial for the success of proximity-logging studies, yet are only rarely reported in full detail. Here, we describe the procedures we employed for mining the data generated by a recent deployment of a novel proximity-logging system, ""Encounternet"", to study social-network dynamics in tool-using New Caledonian crows. Results: Our field deployment of an Encounternet system produced some 240,000 encounter logs for 33 crows over a 19-day study period. Using this dataset, we illustrate a range of procedures, including: examination of tag reciprocity (i.e. whether both tags participating in an encounter detected the encounter and, if so, whether their records differed); filtering of data according to a predetermined signal-strength criterion (to enable analyses that focus on encounters within a particular distance range); amalgamation of temporally clustered encounter logs (to remove data artefacts and to enable robust analysis of biological patterns); and visualisation of dynamic network data as timeline plots (which can be used, among other things, to visualise the simulated diffusion of information). Conclusions: Researchers wishing to study animal social networks with proximity-logging systems should be aware of the complexities involved. Successful data analysis requires not only a sound understanding of hardware and software operation, but also bioinformatics expertise. Our paper aims to facilitate future projects by explaining in detail some of the subtleties that are easily overlooked in first-pass analyses, but are key for reaching valid biological conclusions. We hope that this work will prove useful to other researchers, especially when read in conjunction with three recently published companion papers that report aspects of system calibration and key results. © 2015 Bettaney et al.","Animal social network; Biologging; Business card tag; Contact network; Corvus moneduloides; Encounter mapping; Encounternet; Reality mining; Transceiver tag; Wireless sensor network",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018523307

Many species minimize costs of parasitism by only aggregating seasonally, such as during reproductive periods, but colonial species may still be limited in their potential to evade pathogens. Bats are among the most gregarious mammals and females of many temperate species form maternity colonies in summer where they communally raise pups in both natural and anthropogenic roost structures. Social network structure may differ between natural and anthropogenic roosts in ways that affect pathogen dynamics. We used social network analysis to quantify interactions of big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) in a tree-roosting colony, where the colony is divided among multiple trees each day, and a building colony, where most of the colony roosts together each day. We simulated transmission of a pathogen throughout both sets of networks. We tested three hypotheses: (1) network metrics differ between pregnancy and lactation; (2) changing network structure between reproductive stages influences predicted pathogen dynamics; and (3) network metrics and predicted pathogen dynamics differ between colonies of bats in trees versus buildings. Network structure was weaker for bats roosting in trees during pregnancy and lactation compared to bats roosting in a building, and our models showed that a hypothetical pathogen would spread more rapidly for bats in the building colony. Our results are important for understanding variation in social tendencies and pathogen transmission among colonies of bats and have implications for conservation and public health. Significance statement: Host behavior, particularly social behavior, can affect dynamics of wildlife pathogens. Bats are highly social mammals and females of temperate species form colonies in spring and early summer in tree or building roosts. Thermal characteristics of trees and buildings appear to differ in ways that affect roosting behavior and social interactions. We used social network analyses to quantify interactions of big brown bats in tree and building roosts and simulated consequences for pathogen dynamics. Network structure was weaker for bats roosting in trees with more frequent roost switching and relatively diffuse contacts across the network. Our models showed that a hypothetical pathogen could spread up to four times faster in a building colony compared to a colony of bats roosting in trees. Our results are important for understanding how sociality can influence pathogen dynamics in bats and have implications for conservation and public health. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Coloniality; Fission-fusion; Network analysis; Seasonal aggregation; Susceptible-infected model","bat; building; colonization; network analysis; parasite transmission; parasitism; pathogen; pregnancy; roosting; social network; summer; Eptesicus; Eptesicus fuscus; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961214297

Animal social relationships are inferred from observations of interactions between animals; the pattern of interaction over time indicates the existence (or absence) of a social relationship. Autonomous behavioural recording technologies are increasingly being used to collect continuous interaction data on animal associations. However, continuous data sequences are typically aggregated to represent a relationship as part of one (or several) pictures of the network of relations among animals, in a way that parallels human social networks. This transformation entails loss of information about interaction timing and sequence, which are particularly important to understand the formation of relationships or their disruption. Here, we describe a new statistical model, termed the relational event model, that enables the analysis of fine-grained animal association data as a continuous time sequence without requiring aggregation of the data. We apply the model to a unique data set of interaction between familiar and unfamiliar steers during a series of 36 experiments to investigate the process of social disruption and relationship formation. We show how the model provides key insights into animal behaviour in terms of relationship building, the integration process of unfamiliar animals and group building dynamics. The relational event model is well suited to data structures that are common to animal behavioural studies and can therefore be applied to a range of social interaction data to understand animal social dynamics. © 2015, The Author(s).","Animal social networks; Event probability; Social association; Social structure; Temporal data; Triad",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84939935412

Previous genetic analyses of closely related plovers Charadrius spp. found strikingly different population genetic structure in Madagascar: Kittlitz's plovers are spatially homogenous whereas white-fronted plovers have well segregated and geographically distinct populations. Here, we test the hypotheses that Kittlitz's plovers are spatially interconnected and have extensive social interactions that facilitate gene flow, whereas white-fronted plovers are spatially discrete and have limited social interactions. By experimentally removing mates from breeding pairs and observing the movements of mate-searching plovers in both species, we compare the spatial behavior of Kittlitz's and white-fronted plovers within a breeding season. The behavior of experimental birds was largely consistent with expectations: Kittlitz's plovers travelled further, sought new mates in larger areas, and interacted with more individuals than white-fronted plovers, however there was no difference in breeding dispersal. These results suggest that mating strategies, through spatial behavior and social interactions, are predictors of gene flow and thus genetic differentiation and speciation.

For example, certain traits (metabolic rate, boldness, etc.) have been shown to impact angling vulnerability in fish targeted by recreational anglers. While prior work has focused on boldness behavior and several metrics of metabolic performance, the role of two critical traits, social behavior and swimming performance, have rarely been directly examined. To address this gap, we conducted a study utilizing bluegill Lepomis macrochirus, a highly popular sportfish species found throughout much of North America, to determine the relationship between social behavior, swimming performance, fish size, and angling vulnerability. One hundred and seven bluegill were assessed for social behavior in a laboratory setting, using scoring methods derived from social network analysis. Bluegill were then assessed for swimming performance (critical swimming speed, Ucrit) before being angled in a naturalistic pond setting over nine daily angling sessions. Following angling, a subset of fish were left uncaptured (N = 28), were captured only once (N = 68), or were captured twice (N = 11). Both fish total length and swimming performance were positively linked with vulnerability to initial capture, with fish length also being linked to vulnerability to recapture. In addition to length, social behavior (higher sociability and lower aggression) was positively linked to vulnerability to recapture. Collectively, these results indicate that the drivers of angling vulnerability shift as angled fish populations gain more experience with lures, and that for bluegill, the most vulnerable individuals are likely to be larger and highly social. Significance statement: Individuals within a species show several differences in their behavior and physiology. These differences may have major consequences for fitness, especially in environments impacted by humans. One example of this is freshwater fish targeted by recreational anglers, where individuals with certain behavioral or physiological traits might be more likely to be caught. In this study, we assessed the social behavior, aggression, and swimming performance of bluegill Lepomis macrochirus before angling them in a naturalistic pond setting. We found that larger size and higher swimming performance were linked to vulnerability to initial capture, while length and higher sociability caused fish to be more vulnerable to being caught a second time. Collectively, this means these traits may evolve as a result of selective harvest and also that the drivers of vulnerability may change after fish gain experience with anglers. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Behavioral syndromes; Fisheries-induced evolution; Sociability; Social network analysis; Ucrit","angling; behavioral ecology; eusociality; fish; fitness; freshwater ecosystem; performance assessment; recreational activity; social behavior; social network; swimming behavior; vulnerability; Lepomis macrochirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074151331

For bats, understanding these responses may improve conservation efforts and provide insights into adaptations to environmental conditions. We tracked maternity colonies of northern bats (Myotis septentrionalis) at Fort Knox, Kentucky, USA to evaluate their social and resource networks and space use. Roost and social network structure differed between maternity colonies. Overall roost availability did not appear to be strongly related to network characteristics or space use. In simulations for our two largest networks, roost removal was related linearly to network fragmentation; despite this, networks were relatively robust, requiring removal of >20% of roosts to cause network fragmentation. Results from our analyses indicate that northern bat behavior and space use may differ among colonies and potentially across the maternity season. Simulation results suggest that colony social structure is robust to fragmentation caused by random loss of small numbers of roosts. Flexible social dynamics and tolerance of roost loss may be adaptive strategies for coping with ephemeral conditions in dynamic forest habitats. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Maternity colony; Myotis septentrionalis; Network; Roost loss","adaptation; bat; behavioral response; colony structure; environmental conditions; habitat fragmentation; roost site; simulation; social network; social structure; space use; animal behavior; article; bat; centralization; Myotis septentrionalis; nonhuman; organism colony; simulation; social network; social structure; space; United States; Maternity colony; Myotis septentrionalis; Network; Roost loss; Animals; Association; Chiroptera; Ecosystem; Female; Nesting Behavior; Pregnancy; Pregnancy, Animal; Seasons; Social Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893858115

This isolation represents an impoverished physical and social environment in gregarious animals. It prevents animals from socializing, even when auditory and visual contact is maintained. Zebra finches are colonial songbirds that are widely used as laboratory animals for the study of vocal communication from brain to behavior. In this study, we investigated the effect of single housing on the vocal behavior and the brain activity of male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata): male birds housed in individual cages were compared to freely interacting male birds housed as a social group in a communal cage. We focused on the activity of septo-hypothalamic regions of the ""social behavior network"" (SBN), a set of limbic regions involved in several social behaviors in vertebrates. The activity of four structures of the SBN (BSTm, medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; POM, medial preoptic area; lateral septum; ventromedial hypothalamus) and one associated region (paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus) was assessed using immunoreactive nuclei density of the immediate early gene Zenk (egr-1). We further assessed the identity of active cell populations by labeling vasotocin (VT). Brain activity was related to behavioral activities of birds like physical and vocal interactions. We showed that individual housing modifies vocal exchanges between birds compared to communal housing. This is of particular importance in the zebra finch, a model species for the study of vocal communication. In addition, a protocol that daily removes one or two birds from the group affects differently male zebra finches depending of their housing conditions: while communally-housed males changed their vocal output, brains of individually housed males show increased Zenk labeling in non-VT cells of the BSTm and enhanced correlation of Zenk-revealed activity between the studied structures. These results show that housing conditions must gain some attention in behavioral neuroscience protocols. © 2015 Académie des sciences.","Acoustic communication; Bird; Brain; Social behavior network; Social interactions; Zenk","argiprestocin; testosterone; behavioral response; brain; habitat quality; social behavior; songbird; visual cue; vocalization; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal housing; animal tissue; Article; behavior assessment; brain histology; brain region; cage; cell population; clinical assessment; clinical protocol; comparative study; controlled study; electroencephalogram; experimental animal; hypothalamus; immediate early gene; immunoreactivity; limbic cortex; male; medial preoptic area; neuroscience; nonhuman; physical activity; septum nucleus; social adaptation; social behavior; social behavior network; social environment; social network; stria terminalis; Taeniopygia guttata; verbal communication; vocal behavior; vocalization; zenk gene; zona incerta; animal; brain; finch; physiology; social behavior; Animalia; Aves; Passeri; Taeniopygia guttata; Vertebrata; Animals; Brain; Finches; Housing, Animal; Male; Social Behavior; Vocalization, Animal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983203460

We investigated the structure and properties of inter-organizational social networks involved in the use and management of natural resources in a coastal marine ecosystem in northern Chile proposed as a possible marine protected area. We explored two network configurations: i) relations of collaboration and ii) relations of transfer and exchange of scientific knowledge and information useful to the management of natural resources and the decision-making process involved. Both networks showed little cohesion, with low values of centralization and density indicating a low flow of collaborative and exchange relations among different stakeholders. The knowledge network achieved greater levels of centralization than the collaboration network. National government agencies and fishermen organizations were the most powerful stakeholders in the collaboration network. National government agencies and universities were the most powerful stakeholders in the knowledge network. We found a disconnected network when analyzing the flows of collaboration and knowledge between different administrative operation levels that potentially would hamper the governance of this area. On the other hand, we identified stakeholders that would help to connect the network (bridging stakeholders). Additional analysis of stakeholders using influence-capacity matrix allowed us to identify key stakeholders for planning and implementing the new marine protected area, compare results with the network analysis, and propose network interventions. We propose combining Social Network Analysis with other methods of stakeholder analysis to produce more practical and implementable results.

Social complexity can also have a developmental effect on social skills by providing individuals with opportunities to hone their skills by dealing with the challenges posed in within-group interactions. We examined how social skills develop in captive, adult male brownheaded cowbirds (Molothrus ater) that were exposed to differing levels of 'social complexity' across a 2-year experiment. After each year, subjects housed in groups with dynamic social structure (where many individuals entered and exited the groups during the year) outcompeted birds who had been housed in static groups. Exposure to dynamic structure subsequently led to substantial changes to the social networks of the home conditions during the breeding season. Static groups were characterized by a predictable relationship between singing and reproductive success that was stable across years. In dynamic conditions, however, males showed significant variability in their dominance status, their courting and even in their mating success. Reproductive success of males varied dramatically across years and was responsive to social learning in adulthood, and socially dynamic environments 'trained' individuals to be better competitors, even at an age when the development of many traits important for breeding (like song quality) had ended. © 2012 The Royal Society.","Birdsong; Cowbird; Development; Reproductive success; Social complexity; Social learning","complexity; learning; passerine; reproductive success; social network; Animalia; Aves; Molothrus; Molothrus ater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861541168

SNA is widely applied to questions relating to behavioural ecology but has seen little use in the application to zoo animal management, despite its clear potential. Investment in social bonds between individuals positively affects health status, welfare state, long-term fitness and lifetime reproductive output. Such positive affective states can be maintained consistently within captive situations if more information is known about the social preferences of the individuals that are kept. Disruption to social bonds may lead to impoverished welfare and stress to individuals which have seen their social support compromised. The patterning of social relationships between individuals also influences how space is utilised and how animals interact with resources provided for them. With more detailed knowledge of the social structure of a group or population, social groupings (for example, for captive breeding) can be specifically designed to minimise social stress. Likewise, enhancing the chances of successful reproduction can be achieved if we understand the role that each individual within a network plays and how these roles may impact on the behaviour of others. This paper discusses key aspects of SNA applicable to zoo-based researchers wishing to investigate the social lives of zoo animals. We present a review of how SNA can be used to assess social behaviour and highlight directions for future research. Our aim is to stimulate new research to ultimately improve our understanding of reproductive success, decision-making, group leadership, animal health and enclosure use. We conclude that what can be learned about the dynamics of social zoo-housed species using SNA can directly impact on husbandry decisions and help underpin excellent standards of animal welfare. © 2015 Universities Federation for Animal Welfare.","Animal welfare; Evidence-based husbandry; Group structure; Social network analysis; Social organisation; Zoo animal behaviour","agriculture; animal behavior; animal health; animal welfare; breeding; decision making; disease transmission; group dynamics; group structure; interpersonal communication; leadership; nonhuman; reproductive success; Review; social behavior; social environment; social interaction; social network; social network analysis; social stress; social structure; social support; zoo animal; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930000396

Like many elasmobranchs, manta rays are highly mobile and wide-ranging species threatened by anthropogenic impacts. In shallow water environments, these pelagic rays often form groups and perform several apparently socially mediated behaviors. Group structures may result from active choices of individual rays to interact or passive processes. Social behavior is known to affect spatial ecology in other elasmobranchs, but this is the first study providing quantitative evidence for structured social relationships in manta rays. To construct social networks, we collected data from more than 500 groups of reef manta rays (Mobula alfredi) over 5 years in the Raja Ampat Regency of West Papua. We used generalized affiliation indices to isolate social preferences from non-social associations, the first study on elasmobranchs to use this method. Longer lasting social preferences were detected mostly between female rays. We detected assortment of social relations by phenotype and variation in social strategies, with the overall social network divided into two main communities. Overall network structure was characteristic of a dynamic fission-fusion society, with differentiated relationships linked to strong fidelity to cleaning station sites. Our results suggest that fine-scale conservation measures will be useful in protecting social groups of M. alfredi in their natural habitats and that a more complete understanding of the social nature of manta rays will help predict population responses to anthropogenic pressures, such as increasing disturbance from dive tourism. Significance statement: In social animals, relationships between individuals have important implications for species conservation. Like many other sharks and rays, manta rays are threatened species, and little is known about their natural behavior or how their populations are structured. This study provides evidence of social structure in a wild, free-ranging population of reef manta rays. We show for the first time that individual manta rays have preferred relationships with others that are maintained over time, and structured societies. This study extends our knowledge of elasmobranch ecology and population structuring. Results suggest that understanding social relationships in manta rays will be important in protecting populations from human impacts and developing sustainable, localized conservation and management initiatives. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Generalized affiliation indices; Mobula alfredi; Reef manta ray; Social network analysis; Social preferences","anthropogenic effect; conservation management; disturbance; endangered species; fish; habitat type; network analysis; pelagic fish; phenotype; reef; social network; species conservation; Indonesia; West Papua; Animalia; Chondrichthyes; Elasmobranchii; Mobula; Mobulinae; Raja",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071150773

How does a losing animal respond to loss of status? Here, using the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, we manipulated the social environment, causing males to descend in rank, and then examined changes in behavior, circulating steroids and immediate early gene (IEG) expression (cfos, egr-1) in micro-dissected brain regions as a proxy for neuronal activation. In particular, we examined changes in the conserved 'social behavior network' (SBN), a collection of brain nuclei known to regulate social behaviors across vertebrates. Astatotilapia burtoni has rapidly reversible dominant-subordinate male phenotypes, so that within minutes, descending males lost their bright body coloration, switched to submissive behaviors and expressed higher plasma cortisol levels compared with non-descending and control males. Descending males had higher IEG expression throughout the SBN, but each brain region showed a distinct IEG-specific response in either cfos or egr-1 levels, but not both. Overall, SBN IEG patterns in descending males were distinctly different from the pattern observed in males ascending (subordinate to dominant) in social status. These results reveal that the SBN rapidly coordinates the perception of social cues about status that are of opposite valence, and translates them into appropriate phenotypic changes. This shows for the first time in a non-mammalian vertebrate that dropping in social rank rapidly activates specific socially relevant brain nuclei in a pattern that differs from when males rise to a higher status position. © 2013 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd.","Astatotilapia burtoni; Cfos; Defeat; Immediate early gene; Social behavior network; Status loss; Subordinate; Teleost","early growth response factor 1; fish protein; hormone; animal; animal behavior; article; Astatotilapia burtoni; blood; brain; cfos; cichlid; defeat; gene expression regulation; genetics; immediate early gene; male; metabolism; physiology; social behavior network; social dominance; status loss; subordinate; teleost; territoriality; Astatotilapia burtoni; cfos; defeat; immediate early gene; social behavior network; status loss; subordinate; teleost; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Brain; Cichlids; Dominance-Subordination; Early Growth Response Protein 1; Fish Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Hormones; Male; Territoriality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883566842

Several relevant, proposed hypotheses (such as the training for the unexpected, self-assessment, social skills, and dominance hierarchy hypotheses) make predictions about how animals should optimally choose their play partners based on their familiarity or other demographic variables. We used a social network approach to analyze focal sample data on brown capuchins (Cebus apella), hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas), and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) to understand how these species choose their play partners with respect to demographic variables. Using exponential random graph models (ERGMs), we found that sifaka and capuchins generally tended to play with animals who were similar to them. The baboons were only sensitive to age differences in the formation of strong play relationships. Our data most strongly support the training for the unexpected hypothesis, as according to predictions all species preferred to play with animals who were their close social partners, decreasing the possibility of cheating during play. Through the first application (to our knowledge) of ERGMs to primate behavior, we were able to compare the effects of many demographic variables on the complex, interdependent social structure of primates. Applying this tool to additional groups and species will provide further insight into evolutionary mechanisms of play behavior across taxa. © 2019, Japan Monkey Centre and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Exponential random graph models; Self-assessment hypothesis; Social play behavior; Social skills hypothesis; Training for the unexpected hypothesis","assessment method; demography; modeling; prediction; primate; social network; taxonomy; Animalia; Cebus apella; Papio; Papio hamadryas; Primates; Propithecus; Propithecus diadema; animal; animal behavior; behavioral science; Cebus; evolution; female; male; Papio hamadryas; Philippines; prosimian; psychology; social behavior; social dominance; social network; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Biobehavioral Sciences; Biological Evolution; Cebus; Female; Male; Papio hamadryas; Philippines; Social Behavior; Social Dominance; Social Networking; Strepsirhini",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059449836

For social animals, urbanized environments may alter group social dynamics through modification of the external environment (e.g., resource distribution). This might lead to changes in how individuals associate or engage in group behaviors, which could alter the stability and characteristics of social groups. However, the potential impacts of urban habitat use, and of habitat characteristics in general, on the nature and stability of social associations remain poorly understood. Here, we quantify social networks and dynamics of group foraging behaviors of black-capped chickadees (N = 82, Poecile atricapillus), at four urban and four rural sites weekly throughout the nonbreeding season using feeders with radio frequency identification of individual birds. Because anthropogenic food sources in urban habitats (e.g., bird feeders) provide abundant and reliable resources, we predicted that social foraging associations may be of less value in urban groups, and thus would be less consistent than in rural groups. Additionally, decreased variability of food resources in urban habitats could lead to more predictable foraging patterns (group size, foraging duration, and the distribution of foraging events) in contrast to rural habitats. Networks were found to be highly consistent through time in both urban and rural habitats. No significant difference was found in the temporal clumping of foraging events between habitats. However, as predicted, the repeatability of the clumping of foraging events in time was significantly higher in urban than rural habitats. Our results suggest that individuals living in urban areas have more consistent foraging behaviors throughout the nonbreeding season, whereas rural individuals adjust their tactics due to less predictable foraging conditions. This first examination of habitat-related differences in the characteristics and consistency of social networks along an urbanization gradient suggests that anthropic habitat use results in subtle modifications in social foraging patterns. Future studies should examine potential implications of these differences for variation in predation risk, energy intake, and information flow. © 2019 The Authors.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) subtype H5N1 was first detected in 1996 in Guangdong province, South China and started spreading throughout Asia in early 2004. Since then, control of the disease in China has relied heavily on wide-scale preventive vaccination combined with movement control, quarantine and stamping out. This strategy has been successful in drastically reducing the number of outbreaks during the past 5. years. However, HPAIV H5N1 is still circulating and is regularly isolated in traditional live bird markets (LBMs) where viral infection can persist, which represent a public health hazard for people visiting them. The use of social network analysis in combination with epidemiological surveillance in South China has identified areas where the success of current strategies for HPAI control in the poultry production sector may benefit from better knowledge of poultry trading patterns and the LBM network configuration as well as their capacity for maintaining HPAIV H5N1 infection. We produced a set of LBM network maps and estimated the associated risk of HPAIV H5N1 within LBMs and along poultry market chains, providing new insights into how live poultry trade and infection are intertwined. More specifically, our study provides evidence that several biosecurity factors such as daily cage cleaning, daily cage disinfection or manure processing contribute to a reduction in HPAIV H5N1 presence in LBMs. Of significant importance is that the results of our study also show the association between social network indicators and the presence of HPAIV H5N1 in specific network configurations such as the one represented by the counties of origin of the birds traded in LBMs. This new information could be used to develop more targeted and effective control interventions. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Avian influenza; HPAI H5N1; Market chains; Poultry; Risk assessment; Social network analysis","animal; animal disease; article; avian influenza; bird disease; China; contact examination; cross-sectional study; disease transmission; epidemic; evaluation; health survey; human; influenza; Influenza virus A H5N1; methodology; multivariate analysis; physiology; poultry; risk factor; virology; Animals; China; Contact Tracing; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Influenza, Human; Multivariate Analysis; Population Surveillance; Poultry; Poultry Diseases; Risk Factors; Aves; Avian influenza virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82555166970

Odontomachus hastatus were individually equipped with passive microtransponders to collect their spatial positions in artificial nests automatically. Colonies were surveyed for 3 consecutive weeks to build weighted networks of proximity between ants. The analysis revealed important interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and showed that proximity networks were stable over time. The removal of the queen did not impact the patterns of association between workers, confirming that she did not contribute to shaping network structure.

Thus, the survival of the colony depends on its efficiency in meeting the nutritional needs of all its members. Here, we characterize the network topology of a eusocial insect to understand the role and centrality of each caste in this network during the process of food dissemination. We constructed trophallaxis networks from 34 food-exchange experiments in black garden ants (Lasius niger). We tested the influence of brood and colony size on (i) global indices at the network level (i.e., efficiency, resilience, centralization, and modularity) and (ii) individual values (i.e., degree, strength, betweenness, and the clustering coefficient). Network resilience, the ratio between global efficiency and centralization, was stable with colony size but increased in the presence of broods, presumably in response to the nutritional needs of larvae. Individual metrics highlighted the major role of foragers in food dissemination. In addition, a hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that some domestics acted as intermediaries between foragers and other domestics. Networks appeared to be hierarchical rather than random or centralized exclusively around foragers. Finally, our results suggested that networks emerging from social insect interactions can improve group performance and thus colony fitness. © 2020 Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences","insects; network evolution; self-organization; social evolution; social network analyses","animal; animal behavior; ant; feeding behavior; physiology; principal component analysis; procedures; social behavior; spatiotemporal analysis; Animals; Ants; Behavior, Animal; Feeding Behavior; Principal Component Analysis; Social Behavior; Social Network Analysis; Space-Time Clustering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088782126

While parents are selected to adapt the amount of care according to their offspring's needs, offspring might be selected to demand more care than optimal for parents. Recent studies on birds have shown that the social network structure of offspring affects the amount of care and thus the fitness of families. Such a network structure of repeated interactions is probably influenced by within-brood relatedness.We experimentally manipulated the group composition in a brood-caring spider to test howthe presence of unrelated spiderlings affects the dynamics between female and brood as well as within broods. Broods consisting of siblings grew better and had a lower mortality compared with mixed broods, no matter whether the caring female was a genetic or foster mother. Interestingly, we found that foster mothers lost weight when caring for sibling broods, whereas females caring for mixed broods gained weight. This indicates that females may be willing to share more prey when the brood contains exclusively siblings even if the entire brood is unrelated to the female. Resource distribution may thus be negotiated by offspring dynamics that could have a signalling function to females. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In this study I examined the effect of migration of tall individuals into network hubs on the dynamics of body height within the whole spatial network. The aim of this study was to simulate height trends. Material and methods: Three networks were used for modeling, a regular rectangular fishing net like network, a real world example based on the geographic map of Switzerland, and a random network. All networks contained between 144 and 148 districts and between 265-307 road connections. Around 100,000 agents were initially released with average height of 170 cm, and height standard deviation of 6.5 cm. The simulation was started with the a priori assumption that height variation within a district is limited and also depends on height of neighboring districts (community effect on height). In addition to a neighborhood influence factor, which simulates a community effect, body height dependent migration of conscripts between adjacent districts in each Monte Carlo simulation was used to re-calculate next generation body heights. In order to determine the direction of migration for taller individuals, various centrality measures for the evaluation of district importance within the spatial network were applied. Taller individuals were favored to migrate more into network hubs, backward migration using the same number of individuals was random, not biased towards body height. Network hubs were defined by the importance of a district within the spatial network. The importance of a district was evaluated by various centrality measures. In the null model there were no road connections, height information could not be delivered between the districts. Results: Due to the favored migration of tall individuals into network hubs, average body height of the hubs, and later, of the whole network increased by up to 0.1 cm per iteration depending on the network model. The general increase in height within the network depended on connectedness and on the amount of height information that was exchanged between neighboring districts. If higher amounts of neighborhood height information were exchanged, the general increase in height within the network was large (strong secular trend). The trend in the homogeneous fishnet like network was lowest, the trend in the random network was highest. Yet, some network properties, such as the heteroscedasticity and autocorrelations of the migration simulation models differed greatly from the natural features observed in Swiss military conscript networks. Autocorrelations of district heights for instance, were much higher in the migration models. Conclusion: This study confirmed that secular height trends can be modeled by preferred migration of tall individuals into network hubs. However, basic network properties of the migration simulation models differed greatly from the natural features observed in Swiss military conscripts. Similar network-based data from other countries should be explored to better investigate height trends with Monte Carlo migration approach. © 2017 E.

In this study, we use social network analysis to examine the relationship between primate group size, total brain size, neocortex ratio and several social network metrics concerned with network cohesion. Using female grooming networks from a number of Old World monkey species, we found that neocortex size was a better predictor of network characteristics than endocranial volumes. We further found that when we controlled for group size, neocortex ratio was negatively correlated with network density, connectivity, relative clan size and proportional clan membership, while there was no effect of neocortex ratio on change in connectivity following the removal of the most central female in the network. Thus, in species with larger neocortex ratios, females generally live in more fragmented networks, belong to smaller grooming clans and are members of relatively fewer clans despite living in a closely bonded group. However, even though groups are more fragmented to begin with among species with larger neocortices, the removal of the most central individual does cause groups to fall apart, suggesting that social complexity may ultimately involve the management of highly fragmented social groups while at the same time maintaining overall social cohesion. These results emphasize a need for more detailed brain data on a wider sample of primate species. © 2009 The Royal Society.","Neocortex ratio; Primates; Social brain; Social cohesion; Social complexity","brain; cohesion; female behavior; group size; network analysis; primate; social behavior; article; brain size; Cercopithecidae; grooming; neocortex; nonhuman; organism group size; prediction; priority journal; sex difference; social interaction; social network; statistical analysis; Cercopithecidae; Primates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72749114279

We investigated this tool in describing a translocation network (area that allows movement of animals between geographically isolated locations) used for the conservation of an endangered flightless rail, the Takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri). We collated records of Takahe translocations within New Zealand and used social network principles to describe the connectivity of the translocation network. That is, networks were constructed and analyzed using adjacency matrices with values based on the tie weights between nodes. Five annual network matrices were created using the Takahe data set, each incremental year included records of previous years. Weights of movements between connected locations were assigned by the number of Takahe moved. We calculated the number of nodes (itotal) and the number of ties (ttotal) between the nodes. To quantify the small-world character of the networks, we compared the real networks to random graphs of the equivalent size, weighting, and node strength. Descriptive analysis of cumulative annual Takahe movement networks involved determination of node-level characteristics, including centrality descriptors of relevance to disease modeling such as weighted measures of in degree (kiin), out degree (kiout), and betweenness (Bi). Key players were assigned according to the highest node measure of kiin, kiout, and Bi per network. Networks increased in size throughout the time frame considered. The network had some degree small-world characteristics. Nodes with the highest cumulative tie weights connecting them were the captive breeding center, the Murchison Mountains and 2 offshore islands. The key player fluctuated between the captive breeding center and the Murchison Mountains. The cumulative networks identified the captive breeding center every year as the hub of the network until the final network in 2011. Likewise, the wild Murchison Mountains population was consistently the sink of the network. Other nodes, such as the offshore islands and the wildlife hospital, varied in importance over time. Common network descriptors and measures of centrality identified key locations for targeting disease surveillance. The visual representation of movements of animals in a population that this technique provides can aid decision makers when they evaluate translocation proposals or attempt to control a disease outbreak. © 2014 Society for Conservation Biology.","Disease surveillance; Island ecosystems; New Zealand; Pathogens; Social network analysis; Translocation","bird; captive breeding; connectivity; decision making; disease spread; endangered species; epidemiology; flightlessness; island; isolated population; pathogen; social network; species conservation; translocation; Murchison Mountains; New Zealand; South Island; Southland; Animalia; Porphyrio hochstetteri; Porphyrio mantelli; animal; biological model; bird; Bird Diseases; environmental protection; epidemic; health survey; New Zealand; population density; veterinary; Animals; Bird Diseases; Birds; Conservation of Natural Resources; Disease Outbreaks; Models, Biological; New Zealand; Population Density; Population Surveillance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896316263

Physical, biological, and social systems interacted in complex ways to affect coastal communities. For this integrated case study, we examine linkages between atmospheric conditions (including the North Atlantic Oscillation), ocean circulation, ecosystem conditions, fishery activities, and the livelihoods and population changes of two West Greenland towns: Sisimiut, south of Disko Bay, and Paamiut, on the southwest coast. Sisimiut prospered as a fishing center through the cod-to-shrimp transition. Paamiut, more specialized in cod fishing, declined. Their stories suggest two general propositions about the human dimensions of climatic change. First, socially important environmental changes result not simply from climatic change, but from interactions between climate, ecosystem, and resource usage. Second, environmental changes affect people differentially and through interactions with social factors. Social networks and cohesion (social capital) are important, in addition to skills (human capital), investments (physical capital), and alternative resources (natural capital): all shape how the benefits and costs are distributed.","Climatic change; Elias Kleist; Fisheries; Great Salinity Anomaly; Greenland; Human dimensions; North Atlantic Oscillation; Paamiut; Sisimiut; Unaami","climate change; environmental change; fishing industry; nature-society relations; social change; Greenland; West Greenland; Decapoda (Crustacea); Gadus morhua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142260559

The ecological effects of this transformation have mainly been addressed at the demographic level, for example, finding extinction thresholds. However, interpopulation genetic variability and the subsequent potential for adaptation can be eroded before effects are noticed on species abundances. To what degree this is the case has been difficult to evaluate, partly because of the lack of both spatially extended genetic data and an appropriate framework to map and analyse such data. Here, we extend recent work on the analysis of networks of spatial genetic variation to address the robustness of these networks in the face of perturbations. We illustrate the potential of this framework using the case study of an amphibian metapopulation. Our results show that while the disappearance of some spatial sites barely changes the modular structure of the genetic network, other sites have a much stronger effect. Interestingly, these consequences can not be anticipated using topological, static measures. Mapping these networks of spatial genetic variation will allow identifying significant evolutionary units and how they vanish, merge and reorganise following perturbations. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.","Alytes dickhilleni; Amphibian metapopulation; Ecological networks; Modularity; Resilience","adaptation; biodiversity; data acquisition; extinction; frog; genetic variation; habitat; mapping; metapopulation; resilience; Amphibia; animal; Anura; article; biological model; ecosystem; endangered species; genetic variability; genetics; population genetics; Spain; Amphibians; Animals; Anura; Ecosystem; Endangered Species; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Models, Genetic; Spain; Alytes dickhilleni; Amphibia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877929607

However, there remains no objective measure of the scale at which area-based management can most effectively control systemic production risks. There is also a lack of understanding of how the social connectivity between farmers operating in a given landscape or ‘area’ affects the shared risk perceptions and strategies of shrimp farmers. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a socio-spatial index (SSI) that enables the objective definition of area-based management based on the spatial extent of the social connectivity of shrimp farmers. The study explores how the SSI translates into individual and shared risk behaviour by using structural equation modelling. The results indicate that the SSI provides a generic measure for the socio-spatial extent of area-based aquaculture management and a specific means of determining the probability of farmers adopting shared mitigation strategies related to key risks like disease. The SSI provides the assessment and further development of spatially explicit risk management strategies for promoting responsible aquaculture production. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Landscape governance; Production risks; Shared risk management; Structural equation modelling; Vietnam","aquaculture production; aquaculture system; connectivity; disease incidence; landscape change; operations technology; probability; risk assessment; shrimp fishery; Decapoda (Crustacea)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090561686

However, their empirical validation is scarce. Here we parameterized a joint species model of frugivory and seed dispersal with bird movement and foraging data from tropical and temperate communities. With this model, we investigate the effect of frugivore loss on seed rain, and compare our predictions to those of standard coextinction models and network metrics. Topological coextinction models underestimated species loss after the removal of highly linked frugivores with unique foraging behaviours. Network metrics informed about changes in seed rain quantity after frugivore loss. However, changes in seed rain composition were only predicted by partner diversity. Nestedness, closeness, and d’ specialisation could not anticipate the effects of rearrangements in plant–frugivore communities following species loss.

A model framework is described, which can test hypotheses about spatial structure and connectivity within and between populations and their influence on the productivity (spawning-stock biomass, SSB), stability (variation in SSB), resilience (time to rebuild SSB after environmental disturbance), and sustainability (maximum sustainable fishing mortality and yield) of systems. The general model consists of linked age-structured submodels that incorporate the unique demographics and dynamics of population components, along with the degree and type of connectivity between them. The flexibility of this framework is illustrated with three case studies examining (i) spatial structure within a population of white perch, (ii) different types and degrees of connectivity between populations of Atlantic herring, and (iii) spatial heterogeneity and connectivity within a stock of Atlantic cod. System variance is reduced by abundant, stable population components, and the asynchronous responses of those components. Components with high productivity contributed disproportionately to the resilience of systems. Increased synchrony of component responses to environmental forcing decreased the stability of the overall system. Simulation modelling is a useful approach to evaluate the consequences of spatial structure and connectivity, and can be used to understand better the productivity and dynamics of local and regional populations. © 2010 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.","connectivity; metapopulation; persistence; population; spatial structure","age structure; connectivity; fishery management; fishery production; gadoid fishery; hypothesis testing; metapopulation; persistence; population dynamics; spatial analysis; Clupea harengus; Gadus morhua; Morone americana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77958161830

In species of nonhuman primates that form all-male groups, it is still unclear how the tradeoffs between the benefits of forming an all-male group and the cost of male–male competition in seeking mating opportunities with females in bisexual groups influence social cohesion in different seasons. Here, we used social network analysis to quantify the impact of reproductive seasonality on social cohesion and clique size of bachelor males residing in an all-male unit (AMU) in wild black-and-white snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti). These primates are strict seasonal breeders and live in a modular social system composed of a number of one-male units (OMUs) and an associated peripheral AMU. We found that the AMU social network had a significantly lower density, centralization, clustering coefficient, and smaller clique size during the mating season compared to the non-mating period. However, aggression among AMU males during both mating and non-mating periods was low. Our results suggest that network structure topology in male same-sex social units is modulated by seasonal changes. Bachelor males engage in two types of competition to gain reproductive success: first, which is analogous to contest competition, in which bachelor males act aggressively and challenge OMU leader males in an attempt to take over an OMU; and second, which is more analogous to scramble competition, in which bachelor males avoid aggressive interactions and instead engage in sneaky copulations with fertile females.

Project objectives were to investigate coastal and marine social-ecological dynamics and feedbacks and to analyse socio-political and institutional structures and processes in order to support adaptive coastal governance. Participating researchers worked in the Spermonde Archipelago, off South Sulawesi, Indonesia, between 2007 and 2010. Methods included ship-based research excursions, several classical surveys, anthropological participant observation, and participatory research methods applied by an interdisciplinary social-natural science team. This paper summarises our findings and draws policy conclusions. First, we discuss Marine Protected Areas and participation focussing on local ""rules-in-use"". In addition, reef exploitation and local livelihoods, in particular fisheries and mariculture, and the existing social networks and hierarchies in fisheries are explored to understand social vulnerability, resilience and marine resource governance in the context of the Spermonde Archipelago.

Truly understanding the social-ecological system requires considering the social, cultural, historical, and legal/policy aspects as well. Although regulatory bodies now include human dimensions in their management plans, there are still challenges to integrating social science into the decision-making process. There is a national and international understanding that if resource managers are to understand and develop strategies for coastal resilience, a holistic approach is needed that includes an understanding of the intersection between the dynamics of fisheries management and women's participation within fishing. The objective of this study was to collect oral history data related to past and current strategies for addressing fishing family and community resilience over time. Literature has documented ways in which limited access and catch share programs affect fishing community resilience and sustainability, but have few data that look at how these management systems may be affecting women's roles and participation within the industry.

For example, when probing the social structure of freshwater fish, we may want to look at the network of feeding, aggression, co-operation or mating interactions. Understanding the structure of these multiple networks will allow us to build a model of social behaviour that incorporates multiple influences on social structure. For example, we can look at how associations during foraging behaviour influence mating interactions or co-operative interactions. Thus, the network approach begins to provide a way of understanding and integrating behaviour and behavioural interactions. A recent study by Jessica Flack and colleagues (2006) gives an interesting example of how the network approach can be used. Flack et al. (2006) employed the network approach to characterize the social organization of a group of monkeys, making full use of several novel statistical descriptors that allow a detailed assessment of the social relationships between individuals. A removal experiment demonstrated that the presence of several highranking individuals was essential to retain group cohesion and that the social network fractured into several subunits in their absence due to increased levels of conflict between individuals. The network tools provide sensitive measures of both individual-and group-level characteristics, which it would be hard to measure and analyse while taking a network approach. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-66149132549

We demonstrate that the discovery of new food patches followed the experimentally imposed social structure and that birds disproportionately learnt from those whom they could forage with at the selective feeders.

The advantages of mixed-species groups include improved information transfer, dilution of predation risk, and social thermoregulation. We hypothesized that interspecific associations may be facilitated by the development of heterospecific ""social"" preferences. We manipulated the early social environment of captive Kuhl's pipistrelles (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and Savi's bats (Hypsugo savii), raising newborns in artificial mixed-species groups to simulate conditions in natural mixed-species nurseries. We then measured association patterns among all bats and analyzed the occurrence of social interactions by behavioral observation protocols and social network analyses. Bats preferentially interacted and affiliated with former group members regardless of species, showing that social bonding may occur between different species and that it develops after close contact with newborn heterospecifics, possibly through imprinting-like mechanisms. To our best knowledge, this is the first time such a phenomenon is documented for mammals. Although thermal preferences are often advocated to explain mixed-species associations among bats, individual experience may facilitate heterospecific groups in bats and other taxa. © The Author 2014.","Allogrooming; Chiroptera; Colony; Hypsugo; Imprinting; Pipistrellus; Social network","bat; behavioral response; interspecific interaction; predation risk; preference behavior; social network; thermoregulation; Animalia; Chiroptera; Hypsugo; Hypsugo savii; Mammalia; Pipistrellus; Pipistrellus kuhli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928381197

However, empirical descriptions of contact often overlook some features of individual movement, and decisions about what kind of network to use in a particular setting are commonly ad hoc. Here, we relate individual movement trajectories to contact networks through a tripartite network model of individual, space, and time nodes. Most networks used in animal contact studies (e.g. individual association networks, home range overlap networks, and spatial networks) are simplifications of this tripartite model. The tripartite structure can incorporate a broad suite of alternative ecological metrics like home range sizes and patch occupancy patterns into inferences about contact network metrics such as modularity and degree distribution.We demonstrate the model's utility with two simulation studies using alternative forms of ecological data to constrain the tripartite network's structure and inform expectations about the harder-to-measure metrics related to contact. © 2018 The Author(s).","contact network; Lagrangian movement; network projection; pathogen transmission; tripartite tagging network","Animalia; animal; animal behavior; biological model; computer simulation; ecology; homing behavior; movement (physiology); procedures; spatiotemporal analysis; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Computer Simulation; Ecology; Homing Behavior; Models, Biological; Movement; Spatio-Temporal Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054540878

A considerable body of work has demonstrated that this tendency is strongly expressed in ants, which exhibit fidelity to particular sites both inside and outside the nest. However, thus far many studies of this phenomena have taken the approach of reducing an animal's trajectory to a summary statistic, such as the area it covers. Using both simulations of biased random walks, and empirical trajectories from individual rock ants, Temnothorax albipennis, we demonstrate that this reductive approach suffers from an unacceptably high rate of false negatives. To overcome this, we describe a site-centric approach which, in combination with a spatially-explicit null model, allows the identification of the important sites towards which individuals exhibit statistically significant biases. Using the ant trajectories, we illustrate how the site-centric approach can be combined with social network analysis tools to detect groups of individuals whose members display similar space-use patterns. We also address the mechanistic origin of individual site fidelity; by examining the sequence of visits to each site, we detect a statistical signature associated with a self-attracting walk – a non-Markovian movement model that has been suggested as a possible mechanism for generating individual site fidelity. © 2017 The Authors.

Cultures vary in stability and diversity (polymorphism), ranging from chaotic or drifting cultures, through cumulative polymorphic cultures, to stable monolithic cultures with high conformity levels. What features can sustain polymorphism, preventing cultures from collapsing into either chaotic or highly conforming states? We investigate this question by integrating studies across two quite separate disciplines: The emergence of song cultures in birds, and the spread of public opinion and social conventions in humans. In songbirds, the learning process has been studied in great detail, while in human studies the structure of social networks has been experimentally manipulated on large scales. In both cases, the manner in which communication signals are compressed and filtered - either during learning or while traveling through the social network - can affect culture polymorphism and stability. We suggest a simple mechanism of a shifting balance between converging and diverging social forces to explain these effects. Understanding social forces that shape cultural evolution might be useful for designing agile communication systems, which are stable and polymorphic enough to promote gradual changes in institutional behavior. © 2017 Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd / Journal of Experimental Biology.","Birdsong; Culture; Public opinion; Social learning; Vocal learning","animal; cultural anthropology; human; Internet; physiology; public opinion; social learning; social support; songbird; vocalization; Animals; Culture; Humans; Internet; Public Opinion; Social Learning; Social Support; Songbirds; Vocalization, Animal",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010376051

Current reviews of threats to mixed flocks have only examined two types of anthropogenic pressures: different land use intensity and fragmentation. We highlight the bird trade as another major potential threat for many mixed-species flocking species in Southeast Asia. We examine the potential indirect impact of the bird trade by comparing social networks of flocking data collected over two periods nearly 20 years apart (1997 and 2016) from the same site in Sumatra, Indonesia. We find that the structure of the two networks was significantly correlated. However, of the 90 species observed, 49 had previously been identified as part of the bird trade. These species experienced a significantly greater decrease in network centrality over time compared to the non-traded species, resulting in a loss of structure in the mixed-species flocking network. Simulating further disturbances suggests that flocks may not be resilient to the complete loss of two or more traded species. Our results suggest that trapping is likely to be contributing to the degradation of flocks, and ultimately could lead to the widespread declines in those other species that also rely on mixed-species flocking. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Community ecology; Illegal wildlife trade; IUCN; Mixed-species flocking; Resilience; TRAFFIC","anthropogenic effect; community ecology; crime; ecosystem resilience; fragmentation; group behavior; international organization; land use; social behavior; social network; songbird; trade; Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Southeast Asia; Sumatra; Sunda Isles; Aves; Passeri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045579507

We investigated the role of host social structure in the transmission of Escherichia coli in a wild population of primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi). Using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), we compared genetic similarities between E. coli isolates from different individuals and groups to infer transmission pathways. Results: Correlation of social and transmission networks revealed that membership to the same group significantly predicted sharing of E. coli MLST sequence types (ST). Intergroup encounter rate and a measure of space-use sharing provided equally potent explanations for type sharing between social groups when closely related STs were taken into account, whereas animal age, sex and dispersal history had no influence. No antibiotic resistance was found, suggesting low rates of E. coli spillover from humans into this arboreal species. Conclusions: We show that patterns of E. coli transmission reflect the social structure of this group-living lemur species. We discuss our results in the light of the species' ecology and propose scent-marking, a type of social contact not considered in previous epidemiological studies, as a likely route of transmission between groups. However, further studies are needed to explicitly test this hypothesis and to further elucidate the relative roles of direct contact and environmental transmission in pathogen transfer. © 2016 Springer et al.","Escherichia coli; Fecal-oral disease transmission; Multilocus sequence typing; Propithecus verreauxi; Scent-marking; Social contacts; Social network analysis; Spillover","coliform bacterium; disease transmission; epidemiology; genetic analysis; host-pathogen interaction; infectious disease; network analysis; primate; social network; Animalia; Escherichia coli; Lemur; Primates; Propithecus; Propithecus verreauxi; animal; antibiotic resistance; classification; ecosystem; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli infection; feces; female; human; Madagascar; male; microbiology; multilocus sequence typing; physiology; prosimian; social behavior; transmission; veterinary; zoonosis; Animals; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Ecosystem; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Infections; Feces; Female; Humans; Madagascar; Male; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Social Behavior; Strepsirhini; Zoonoses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957863555

To maximize inclusive fitness, reciprocal food sharing should occur among close kin. Why then do females with kin roost-mates help non-kin? We tested the hypothesis that helping non-kin increases a bat’s success at obtaining future donations by expanding its network of potential donors. On six occasions, we individually fasted 14 adult females and measured donations from 28 possible donors. Each female was fasted before, during and after a treatment period, when we prevented donations from past donors (including 10 close relatives) by simultaneously fasting or removing them. This experiment was designed to detect partner switching and yielded three main results. First, females received less food when we prevented donations from a past donor versus a control bat. Donors within a group are therefore not interchangeable. Second, the treatment increased the variance in donors’ contributions to food received by subjects, suggesting the possibility of alternative responses to a partner’s inability to reciprocate. Finally, bats that fed more non-kin in previous years had more donors and received more food during the treatment. These results indicate that a bat can expand its network of possible donors by helping non-kin. © 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We explore the potential for large individual capture datasets, which arise from population monitoring projects such as bird banding stations, to fill this gap. Using a 23-year dataset from San Jose, CA, comprised of six passerine bird species from four families, we constructed social networks to investigate whether age-, sex-, and taxon-related patterns of social association could be detected. We found support for age-related patterns in social behavior and patterns of overall species differences that agreed with past work. We then explored interactions between species and patterns in social behavior over time, two questions that have historically been difficult to address. We detected positive assortment by taxon, and we observed a significant multi-decade decrease in mean degree. Using an agent-based simulation to allow us to independently vary behavior and aspects of the capture dataset, we found that sample size and capture probability affected the metrics that were intended to only measure social behavior, but that these confounding effects could be effectively managed in many cases. We conclude that while analysis of individual capture datasets should not replace more intensive studies of social behavior, the utilization of these data could considerably expand the scope of our knowledge of social behavior, particularly at large temporal scales and for species that are difficult to observe. © 2021, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.","Age; Agent-based model; Bird banding; Passerellidae; Social behavior; Social network",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101698592

Nevertheless, the mechanisms linking social behaviour to infection risk are poorly known. We conducted a field experiment to examine how host intrinsic traits, behaviour and physiology affect infection of nonhuman primates with gastrointestinal parasites. We measured rate to reinfection in a social group of red-capped mangabeys, Cercocebus torquatus, following chemotherapeutic treatment for parasite infections. By measuring behaviour, infection and glucocorticoid levels, we compared the relative effects of space sharing, directional contact and physiological stress on risk of acquiring new infections. We found that, within proximity networks, individuals that were central, well connected and had a tendency to switch groups were at increased risk of infection with helminths. Protozoan infections, however, were acquired more uniformly across the population. In general, position in the social network and, in particular, space sharing appears to be more important than the immunosuppressive effects of physiological stress or host traits in determining risk of infection. Our results suggest that future studies of disease ecology within wildlife populations should focus on measures of network association in addition to individual host traits. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Antiparasite treatment; Gastrointestinal parasite; Helminth; Host trait; Infectious disease transmission; Physiological stress; Primate; Protozoa; Red-capped mangabey; Social network","behavioral response; chemotherapy; disease transmission; disease treatment; endoparasite; gastroenteritis; host-parasite interaction; infectious disease; infectivity; parasite; physiological response; primate; protozoan; social behavior; social network; Animalia; Cercocebus torquatus; Primates; Protozoa; Vermes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971418579

To make this process adaptive, animals should be selective with respect to when and whom to copy. The cost of decision making can be curbed by cognitive biases favouring particular categories of individuals. Such model biases are well documented, but few, if any, experimental studies have addressed potential developmental causes of this variation. We therefore tested whether and how the postnatal environment affected social-learning preferences in a known social learner the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. Birds from experimentally manipulated brood sizes, a treatment known to affect adult phenotypic quality in this species, were tested in an established observer-demonstrator paradigm. Naïve observers could watch unfamiliar same-sex conspecifics feed from differently coloured novel feeders. When subsequently allowed to choose between identical feeders, postnatal conditions (=rearing brood size) had strong effects on who copied whom in adulthood: males preferred the feeders of demonstrators from large brood sizes, females those of demonstrators from brood sizes matching their own, suggesting stratified information transfer within foraging groups. Our results demonstrate how individuals' developmental history can explain substantial interindividual variation in model biases and ensuing structured information transfer within groups. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Condition; Developmental plasticity; Model biases; Postnatal environment; Social learning; State dependent; Taeniopygia guttata; Zebra finch","biological development; brood size; cognition; conspecific; decision making; environmental conditions; experimental study; foraging behavior; individual variation; learning; life history; natural selection; passerine; phenotypic plasticity; preference behavior; social network; Animalia; Aves; Taeniopygia guttata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870443289

Many of these fields have assumed that females lacked the ability to produce song and have therefore treated song as a male-specific behavior. Consequently, much of our understanding regarding the evolution and neural control of song behavior has been driven by these assumptions. Here we review literature from diverse fields to provide a broader perspective of the role of females in vocal communication and courtship. Recent evidence indicates that song evolved in both males and females and instances of female song are still common. The specialized neural circuit known as the “song system,” which is necessary for singing in males, is also present in females, including those that do not sing, implying broader functions that include evaluating male song and controlling courtship behavior. In addition to having flexible, individualized preferences, females actively shape their social network through their interactions with males, females, and juveniles. We suggest that by developing more accurate hypotheses concerning the role of females we may better understand the evolution and neural mechanisms of song production and courtship behavior. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Birdsong; Copulation solicitation display; Mating posture; Mating preference","behavioral response; courtship; evolution; mating behavior; preference behavior; social network; song; songbird; vocalization; adult; body position; case report; copulation; courtship; driver; female; human; juvenile; literature; male; mate choice; nervous system; nonhuman; singing; social network; songbird; animal; brain; courtship; physiology; psychology; social behavior; songbird; vocalization; Animals; Brain; Courtship; Female; Social Behavior; Songbirds; Vocalization, Animal",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039940483

Theoretically, the chosen strategy depends on the prevailing possibilities and constraints to the animal. Consequently, insects often change strategy between life stages, but a switch in strategy within a life stage is quite uncommon. In the Swedish shieldbug, Graphosoma lineatum L. (Heteroptera: Pentatomidae), there is a colour change from the pre-hibernating to the post-hibernating adults that alters their protective strategy from effective crypsis to aposematism, although both stages are distasteful to predators. The change in colour occurs as there is a shift of seasons, which alters the environmental background. Here, we investigate whether there is a change in behaviour in G. lineatum connected to the change in colouration and protective strategy. We therefore measured the motion levels in the two different colour forms of G. lineatum, both in the field and in a more controlled laboratory set up. Our result clearly shows that there is a change in behaviour connected to the change in colour. Thus, we found that the cryptic pre-hibernation form has a significantly lower motion level than the aposematic post-hibernation form, which is in line with the fact that motion disrupts crypsis, but not aposematism. © 2011 The Authors.

However there is a surprising paucity of experimental evidence in wild populations. Here, we examine producer–scrounger games in five subpopulations of birds feeding at a socially learnt foraging task. Over four weeks, a bimodal distribution of producers and scroungers emerged in all areas, with pronounced and consistent individual tactic specialization persisting over 3 years. Tactics were unrelated to exploratory personality, but correlated with latency to contact and learn the foraging task, with the late arrivers and slower learners more likely to adopt the scrounging role. Additionally, the social environment was also important: at the broad scale, larger subpopulations with a higher social density contained proportionally more scroungers, while within subpopulations scroungers tended to be central in the social network and be observed in larger foraging flocks. This study thus provides a rare example of a stable, dimorphic distribution of producer–scrounger tactics in a wild population. It further gives support across multiple scales for a major prediction of social foraging theory; that the frequency of scroungers increases with group size. © 2017 The Authors.","Animal personality; Parus major; Producer–scrounger games; Social foraging; Social learning; Social network analysis","foraging behavior; group size; learning; network analysis; passerine; population density; population dynamics; specialization; subpopulation; wild population; Animalia; Aves; Parus major; animal; feeding behavior; female; game; learning; male; physiology; songbird; Animals; Feeding Behavior; Female; Game Theory; Learning; Male; Songbirds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017527858

New techniques for measuring associations, in particular social networks and null simulations, have been applied to mixed-species group analyses. Unanswered questions include: (1) How do these methods compare to each other and to the traditional frequency table approach? (2) How similar are associations for the same pair of species in different habitats, such those with different disturbance histories or at different altitudes? (3) What traits of species influence these association strengths? Using data from an intensive study of mixed-species bird flocks in Sri Lanka, we used Mantel tests to compare associations calculated through three methods: the phi coefficient, social networks, and null simulations. Results from the three methods varied (0.53 < r < 0.75), but converged when out-of-flock data were added to the phi coefficient and social network methods (0.75 < r < 0.94). Correlations between the associations in different habitats were uniformly low (all <0.50) across all methods. These results, when combined with the fact that only a small percentage of the associations were statistically significant (9–14%, depending on the method used), suggest that on average, birds may not have strong preferences for other species in flocks. The trait analysis, conducted using the Multiple Regression Quadratic Assignment Procedure found that species that are more similar to each other in their body mass and diet had higher association strengths. This result was similar to what has been found before in global meta-analyses; however, contrary to earlier reports, in this study association strength increased with increasing phylogenetic distance. The strength of these results decreased when non-statistically significant species associations were included in these analyses or out-of-flock data were excluded, again emphasizing that the method of calculating species associations can influence conclusions. Nevertheless, it is clear that species associations in avian mixed-species groups are not greatly consistent across natural or anthropogenic gradients, although they are influenced to a certain extent by similarities in species traits, especially for species that show statistically significant associations. © 2018 The Authors.","birds; community ecology; disturbance; South Asia; species interactions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052517816

They are found throughout the world in forested habitats but are generally reduced in size or frequency by human disturbance. In southern China, a unique MSF system is led by several species of closely-related fulvettas (Alcippe morrisonia, A. hueti, and A. davidi). Our objective was to understand how this system is distributed across elevational gradients, especially moving west into the Hengduan Mountains, and how it responds to human disturbance. We sampled leadership and composition of 375 MSFs over 2 yr in and surrounding 5 nature reserves in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province, with transects placed in different land use types-protected forest, buffer areas, or agriculture- A nd ranging from 400 to 3,200 m. We also sampled birds outside of MSFs. We found MSFs led by fulvettas (A. fratercula and A. davidi) in forests across the region up to 2,900 m. Elevation was not a significant influence on MSF size or prevalence in models that also included land use. We found that MSFs were encountered at only one-third of the frequency in agriculture as in forest, and had strongly different composition and leadership. Although MSFs in buffer areas were more similar to those in forest, birds in buffer areas had lower flocking propensity, different flock leaders, and less complex social networks. In particular, buffer transects that were seeded pine had low numbers of fulvetta-led MSFs and forest specialists in MSFs. In the future, it is important to understand which vegetational characteristics allow MSFs, particularly fulvetta-led MSFs, to persist in buffer habitats. © 2019 American Ornithological Society.

However, there is no clear evidence that such associations are equitable, that is, they are mutual between individuals. We addressed this issue in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a species in which social network analyses have evidenced nonrandom social associations between individuals. We measured the mutual preference in pairs of guppies that previously familiarized in groups of either 2 or 6 individuals. To estimate the equitability of social associations, we first tested the preference of one fish for a familiar stimulus fish over an unfamiliar stimulus fish, and then, we similarly tested the preference of the other fish. Irrespective of the group size experienced during familiarization (2 or 6 individuals), we found a within-pair consistency in the preference for the familiar fish, indicating that guppies developed social associations that are mutual between individuals. In a further condition, we tested pairs of unfamiliar individuals to assess the role of familiarity in equitable social associations. We found that equitable social associations did not develop in absence of previous familiarization and were not based on spontaneous preferences or phenotypic assortment. Our results demonstrate that familiarity mediates the development of equitable social associations in guppies and suggest that this behavior may be more widespread than previously considered. © 2018 The Author(s).","equitability; familiarity; Poecilia reticulata; social association; social preference","cyprinid; familiarity; group size; individual variation; phenotype; preference behavior; social behavior; social network; Poecilia reticulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062808930

However, these impacts might depend on the type of behaviour, how sociality as a biological trait is defined (e.g. network degree vs. mean edge strength) and the type of social relationship between the interacting individuals. We used the highly social common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus to test how an immune challenge by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections affects two different social behaviours and three alternate measures of sociality, and whether the LPS effect differs by kinship relationship. Effects of sickness should be lower for social behaviours that bestow greater benefits to inclusive fitness, such as food sharing. As predicted, immune-challenged bats experienced a greater reduction in allogrooming received than food sharing received. Sickness effects might also depend on how a social interaction is defined (e.g. the number of grooming partners vs. the duration of grooming events). We predicted that sickness would impact both the number and duration of social encounters, but we only detected a decrease in the number of grooming partners. Finally, sickness effects might vary with social relationship type. We predicted that sickness effects should be smaller for interactions among close kin. As expected, the immune challenge had smaller effects on mother–offspring interactions. In conclusion, our results highlight the need to explicitly consider how the effects of sickness on social network structure can differ depending on the ‘who, what, and how’ of social interactions, because these factors are likely to influence how sickness behaviour alters pathogen transmission. © 2020 British Ecological Society","pathogen transmission; sickness behaviour; social behaviour; social network; vampire bat","bat; fitness; immune system; immunity; kinship; parasite transmission; pathogenicity; polysaccharide; social behavior; Desmodus rotundus; animal; bat; food; grooming; social behavior; social interaction; Animals; Chiroptera; Food; Grooming; Social Behavior; Social Interaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082072285

We describe the unusually long monogamous pairing period in this lizard before mating takes place each spring, and the long-term persistence of mating pairs, reforming each spring for up to 27 years. We review hypotheses, observations, and experiments and conclude that females drive the pairing, becoming more receptive to males that have provided prolonged attention, because of the advantages they gain through greater awareness of approaching danger. We suggest that long-term pair fidelity has resulted from a higher reproductive efficiency between familiar partners. We then consider the broader social network structure in the sleepy lizard population, suggesting from our analyses that lizards make more contacts with their neighbors, sometimes agonistically, than if they were moving at random. There are few kin-based associations in the networks, but lizards with different personality types have different network positions. The broad social structure of the population is robust to ecological and environmental changes, although various network parameters are adjusted with different climate or habitat conditions. The overall social structure of the sleepy lizard population has an important role in transmission of parasites and pathogens. Finally we consider why this species is one of the very few reptiles for which stable social living has been reported. This may be because reptile social living is relatively under studied. Alternatively, we suggest, many reptile species may be constrained from evolving social structures, because they lack either the necessary cognitive ability or a strong defense against the high risk of pathogen transmission that comes from social living. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Monogamy; Reptile; Social network; Tiliqua","animal experiment; awareness; climate; ecology; environmental change; female; habitat; lizard; male; mating; monogamy; nonhuman; parasite; participant observation; personality; social network; social structure; species; spring",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014508174

Such aggregations are potentially driven by contrasting reproductive and behavioral strategies between the sexes, leading to distinct sexual segregation. There is, however, no experimental evidence that such predator aggregations are governed by intrinsic social systems, demonstrating long-term temporal stability. Social network structure, temporal stability, and activity profiles were analyzed to examine the impact of introduced males on social structure of 4 captive groups of female catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). Aside from foraging and habitat selection pressures, we question whether individual female sharks manage additional social demands that potentially influence activity budget and susceptibility to male harassment. Shark groups demonstrated marked differences in their tendency to aggregate in a unisex environment and concomitantly showed significant differences in social response to male presence. Dichotomy in social structure of the 4 groups revealed that well-connected individuals demonstrated greater resilience to male disturbance. Socially isolated females experienced greater levels of partner exchange, reduced temporal stability, and increased activity levels in the presence of males and control females. These results are the first to demonstrate the disruptive influence that male and novel females have on weak female shark social interactions; conversely, aggregations demonstrating relatively strong temporally stable social bonds (at least by some individuals) are particularly resilient to potential male harassment and novel (female) intruders. We highlight that additional 'social constraints' may have disparate influence on individuals occupying different structural positions within a network and may thus impact individual fitness unequally. © The Author 2010.","aggregation; behavior; fish; network analysis; sexual segregation; shark; social structure","activity pattern; aggregation behavior; captive population; female behavior; fitness; habitat selection; population structure; predator; reproductive strategy; sexual behavior; shark; social network; social structure; Chondrichthyes; Scyliorhinus canicula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954358163

Comparing sociality of phylogenetically divergent populations under the same ecological conditions or between groups within a population under different ecological conditions can identify the relative influence of ecological selection on group formation. Here, we compare the size and persistence of social groups within a community of Atlantic killer whales, comparing between data collected from an area around Scotland where the whales have mainly been seen to hunt seals and data collected from an area around Iceland where the whales have mainly been seen to hunt herring. Additionally, we compare the observed social structure with that of previously studied Pacific ecotypes. Atlantic killer whale groups in both locations had a stable long-term primary social tier (association index level > 0.8) similar to that of Pacific killer whales. However, associations between these groups were much lower when hunting for seals than for fish in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. The occurrence of these differences in sociality between Atlantic groups, which are linked in a single social network, suggests that ecological selection partially determines sociality in this species. Furthermore, if sociality was constrained by phylogenetic inertia, then the Atlantic killer whales would all be expected to be more similar to the Pacific fish-eating ecotype than the more phylogenetically distant Pacific mammal-eating ecotype. Our study suggests that sociality in killer whales is to some extent plastic and can be adapted to the local ecological conditions. © The Author 2011.","ecology; killer whale; orca; orcinus; sociality","clupeoid; data set; divergence; ecotype; eusociality; group size; phenotypic plasticity; phylogenetics; pinniped; selection; social network; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Iceland; Pacific Ocean; Scotland; United Kingdom; Cetacea; Clupeidae; Mammalia; Orcinus; Orcinus orca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857558616

These can be prophylactic and/or induced upon pathogen exposure.

The social cichlid fish Neolamprologus multifasciatus builds nests by digging up aquatic snail shells, creating an extended sexual phenotype that is highly amenable to experimental manipulation through addition of extra shells. Here, we find sources of both positive sexual selection and opposing natural selection acting on this trait; augmenting shell nests increases access to mates, but also increases social aggression and predation risk. Increasing the attractive- ness of one male also changed social interactions throughout the social network and altered the entire community structure. Manipulated males produced and received more displays from neighbouring females, who also joined augmented male territories at higher rates than unmanipulated groups. However, males in more attractive territories received more aggression from neigh- bouring males, potentially as a form of social policing. We also detected a significant ecological cost of the ‘over-extended’ phenotype; heterospecific pre- dators usurped augmented nests at higher rates, using them as breeding sites and displacing residents. Using these natural experiments, we find that both social and ecological interactions generate clear sources of selection mediating the expression of an extended phenotype in the wild. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

For example, information on patterns of aggression and mating behavior across years can be used to monitor well-being, assess response to changes to group composition, and promote successful reproduction. Here, we report on patterns of aggression and pair bonding by American flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber) at the Audubon Zoo, New Orleans USA across 4 years (2012-2015), a period that included a simultaneous introduction and removal of individuals in 2014. At the population level, overall rates and social network indices of aggressive interactions were relatively stable over the study period, without a strong signal of the 2014 replacement event. At the individual level, flamingos exhibited a high degree of within-individual consistency in levels of aggression initiated (W=0.530, P<0.001), and received (W=0.369, P=0.042). In terms of pair bonds, females re-paired with the same individuals across years more frequently (between 58% and 100% from year to year) than they switched mates, and no bonds were established between pre-existing and introduced individuals. These findings indicate a high degree of stability in aggression and pair bonding behavior in this population of captive flamingos, at both the population and individual level. Longitudinal studies such as this one provide an opportunity to better our understanding of flamingos and other long-lived, group-living animals along with their management needs, especially in terms of maintaining social cohesion in captivity and improving captive breeding programs. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Captive animals; Personality; Social networks; UCINET; Zoo management","aggression; animal; bird; female; longitudinal study; Louisiana; male; physiology; sexual behavior; zoo animal; Aggression; Animals; Animals, Zoo; Birds; Female; Longitudinal Studies; Male; New Orleans; Sexual Behavior, Animal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959019017

One of the reasons for this situation is the scarcity of wholesale selling sites. In this context, the Mercado del Mar (MM), located in Guadalajara city, Jalisco, is the second biggest wholesale fish market in Mexico, with a distribution of about 500 tons per day and a variety of about 350 different species of fish. In this paper, we argue that MM has accumulated social capital, which is formed from two main resources: buyer and seller relationships, and reputation. Specifically, the MM manages a broad and intensive interaction among business actors and the already achieved reputation allows the MM to adapt to market changes. To validate our hypotheses, an empirical study was conducted in 2015 by means of interviews to fish wholesalers in the MM and a sample of their suppliers and buyers. For simplicity we have only considered fresh water fish. We have followed snow-ball sampling as the survey strategy. Results show that the MM has responded to fish market dynamics organizing a complex network of buyers and suppliers whose relationships can be explained in the form of strong and weak ties. At the same time, reputation has been the central resource to build this social capital and also gives place to market transactions. Additionally, the strategic position of Guadalajara city and the well-connected routes have facilitated fish bulking and distribution in the region. © 2017 Pedroza-Gutiérrez, Hernández.

However, considerable diversity is observed in the actual behaviour patterns amongst nearly 30000 fish species. The huge variation found in socio-sexual behaviours and strategies is likely generated by a morphologically and genetically well-conserved small forebrain system. Hence, teleost fish provide a useful model to study the fundamental mechanisms underlying social brain functions. Herein we review the foundations underlying fish social behaviours including sensory, hormonal, molecular and neuroanatomical features. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons clearly play important roles, but the participation of vasotocin and isotocin is also highlighted. Genetic investigations of developing fish brain have revealed the molecular complexity of neural development of the SBN. In addition to straightforward social behaviours such as sex and aggression, new experiments have revealed higher order and unique phenomena such as social eavesdropping and social buffering in fish. Finally, observations interpreted as ‘collective cognition’ in fish can likely be explained by careful observation of sensory determinants and analyses using the dynamics of quantitative scaling. Understanding of the functions of the SBN in fish provide clues for understanding the origin and evolution of higher social functions in vertebrates. © 2021 Cambridge Philosophical Society","aggression; amygdala; androgen; criticality; habenula; hypothalamus; oestrogen; reproduction; sex change; transcriptome",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100826901

Nocturnal prosimians are in fact mostly seen alone during their nightly activities and therefore termed’ solitary foragers’, but that does not mean that they are not social. Moreover, designating their social organisation as’ solitary’, implies that their way of life is uniform in all species. It has, however, emerged over the last decades that all of them exhibit not only some kind of social network but also that those networks differ among species. There is a need to classify these social networks in the same manner as with group-living (gregarious) animals if we wish to link up the different forms of primate social organisation with ecological, morphological or phylogenetic variables. In this review, we establish a basic classification based on spatial relations and sociality in order to describe and cope properly with the social organisation patterns of the different species of nocturnal prosimians and other mammals that do not forage in cohesive groups. In attempting to trace the ancestral pattern of primate social organisation, the Malagasy mouse and dwarf lemurs and the Afro-Asian bushbabies and lorises are of special interest because they are thought to approach the ancestral conditions most closely. These species have generally been believed to exhibit a dispersed harem system as their pattern of social organisation (‘dispersed’ means that individuals forage solitarily but exhibit a social network). Therefore, the ancestral pattern of primate social organisation was inferred to be a dispersed harem. In fact, new field data on cheirogaleids combined with a review of patterns of social organisation in strepsirhines (lemurs, bushbabies and lorises) revealed that they exhibit either dispersed multi-male systems or dispersed monogamy rather than a dispersed harem system. Therefore, the concept of a dispersed harem system as the ancestral condition of primate social organisation can no longer be supported. In combination with data on social organisation patterns in ‘primitive’ placentals and marsupials, and in monotremes, it is in fact most probable that promiscuity is the ancestral pattern for mammalian social organisation. Subsequently, a dispersed multi-male system derived from promiscuity should be regarded as the ancestral condition for primates. We further suggest that the gregarious patterns of social organisation in Aotus and Avahi, and the dispersed form in Tarsius evolved from the gregarious patterns of diurnal primates rather than from the dispersed nocturnal type. It is consequently proposed that, in addition to Aotus and Tarsius, Avahi is also secondarily nocturnal. © 2000 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Ancestral primate; Dispersed multi-male system; Evolution; Lemurs; Lorisiforms; Nocturnal prosimians; Promiscuity; Social organisation; Strepsirhines","animal behavior; article; classification; ecology; evolution; feeding; gender; mammal; marsupial; morphology; mouse; nonhuman; phylogeny; primate; prosimian; sexual behavior; social environment; social structure; species difference; Aotus; Avahi; Tarsius",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033780974

This sharing-as-signaling hypothesis predicts an association between sharing and status. Using exponential random graph modeling, this prediction is tested on a social network of between-household food-sharing relationships in the fishing and sea-hunting village of Lamalera, Indonesia. Previous analyses (Nolin, 2010. Food-sharing networks in Lamalera, Indonesia: reciprocity, kinship, and distance. Human Nature 21, 243-268) have shown that most sharing in Lamalera is consistent with reciprocal altruism. The question addressed here is whether any additional variation may be explained as sharing-as-signaling by high-status households. The results show that high-status households both give and receive more than other households, a pattern more consistent with reciprocal altruism than costly signaling. However, once the propensity to reciprocate and household productivity are controlled, households of men holding leadership positions show greater odds of unreciprocated giving when compared to households of nonleaders. This pattern of excessive giving by leaders is consistent with the sharing-as-signaling hypothesis. Wealthy households show the opposite pattern, giving less and receiving more than other households. These households may reciprocate in a currency other than food, or their wealth may attract favor-seeking behavior from others. Overall, status covariates explain little variation in the sharing network as a whole, and much of the sharing observed by high-status households is best explained by the same factors that explain sharing by other households. This pattern suggests that multiple mechanisms may operate simultaneously to promote sharing in Lamalera and that signaling may motivate some sharing by some individuals even within sharing regimes primarily maintained by other mechanisms. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Costly signaling; ERGM; Food sharing; Lamalera; Social network analysis; Status competition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862504484

Social ties are important for group coordination at collective tasks, and social coordination can facilitate synchronized reproduction among colony members. Synchronized reproduction in turn can amplify the benefits of coloniality, such as social foraging and predator avoidance. We conducted a field study to investigate whether synchronized reproduction among individuals in replicated colonies is linked to the strength of their social bond, and whether these strong bonds are maintained beyond the reproductive period. We PIT-tagged wild zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), monitoring their reproduction and social foraging over two consecutive years. We then used social network analysis to characterize the strength of social bonds among birds in the population. We show that birds that are more synchronized in their reproductive timing (and breed in the same colony) had significantly stronger social ties both during and after reproduction than expected by chance. Our long-term sampling also revealed that the strong social ties between synchronized breeders were carried over across years. Our study reveals a strong correspondence between synchronized breeding and the social structure of the breeding colony. This suggests that the synchrony between pairs is not a simple process based on opportunity, but a mechanism underpinned by more complex sociality, which could be carried over to other behavioural contexts. The maintenance of cross-contextual social ties across years suggests that social structure could have extensive consequences on the overall life history of individuals in addition to playing a key role for the reproductive dynamics of colonial breeders. © 2019 The Authors.

Theory predicts that natural selection should favour females that are able to correctly assess the risk of predation and then use that information to avoid high-risk oviposition sites to reduce the risk of offspring predation. Despite the potential significance of such behaviour on individual fitness, population dynamics and community structure, relatively few studies of oviposition behaviour connected to the risk of predation have been carried out. 2. However, some recent studies suggest that oviposition site selection in response to risk of predation may be a common phenomenon, at least among amphibians and mosquitoes. A vast majority of previous studies have, however, neglected to investigate how the offspring are affected, in terms of fitness related parameters, by the maternal oviposition site choice. 3. In an outdoor artificial pond experiment we tested the oviposition site selection of female aquatic beetles (Hydroporus spp.) in relation to the presence or absence of a predatory fish (Perca fluviatilis). In addition, we monitored how the oviposition site selection affected the behaviour, growth and food resource of the progeny. 4. We show that free-flying females of the aquatic beetles Hydroporus incognitus and H. nigrita prefer to oviposit in waters without fish compared with waters with fish. Larval activity of Hydroporus spp. was unaffected by fish presence. Our results indicate that beetle larvae from females that do lay eggs in waters with fish show increased growth compared with larvae in waters without fish. We explain this difference in growth by a higher per-capita food supply in the presence of a fish predator. This finding may have important implications for our understanding of how the variance of oviposition site selection in a population is sustained. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Growth; Habitat selection; Hydroporus; Oviposition; Predation risk","beetle; community structure; larval development; life history; oviposition; population dynamics; predation risk; reproduction; site selection; Amphibia; Coleoptera; Hydroporus; Hydroporus incognitus; Hydroporus nigrita; Perca fluviatilis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745062212

Over the past few years an industry has developed around the rearing of hybrid red and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus L.) in cages in the Ping River in northern Thailand. In this article we report on a study of how households gain access to river cage sites to farm fish. The findings are based on a case-control study of 400 households, half of which had a history of fish farming and half which did not. Additional information was gathered from qualitative in-depth interviews with 93 stakeholders. Households with good access to farming sites, financial capital, and social networks are more likely to farm fish. Proximity to the river front was a very important factor and operated at a micro-level within villages with river borders. Land and vehicle assets were also associated with fish farming-more so than monthly income levels-probably because they reflect access to credit. Social capital measured as belonging to various kinds of groups was also associated with fish farming, but may have been in part an outcome rather than a pre-requisite. Many fish farmers start through encouragement and invitations by firms or the fisheries department. Sites for cage aquaculture in rivers have characteristics somewhere between a private and a club good: those who don't live near the river are usually excluded, but rivalry for sites among those who live close becomes an issue with congestion of farms arising from expansion in number of cages or other factors that reduce availability of suitable rearing sites like variability in climate, water flows, water quality, and government regulations. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","cage aquaculture; farming sites; governance; property rights; Resource access; social network","aquaculture industry; cage culture; fish culture; governance approach; property rights; public access; social capital; social network; fishery management; fishing gear; stakeholder; Northern Region [Thailand]; Ping River; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896478303

However, the effect of kinship on nonbreeding social organization is still poorly understood despite its potential fitness implications. Here, we investigated the origins and consequences of kin associations in nonbreeding flocks of long-tailed tits, Aegithalos caudatus, an atypical cooperative breeder where helpers are failed breeders that redirect care towards relatives living in kin neighbourhoods. We found that kinship is an important factor in initial grouping decisions; all members of a nuclear family initially joined the same flock and failed breeders chose to flock with their relatives. Flocks that merged during the nonbreeding season also contained relatives. In contrast to these findings of positive kin association, when long-tailed tits switched flocks they tended to disperse into flocks with fewer relatives, although such switches often occurred with kin. In a playback experiment, we found no evidence that aggression shown towards members of other flocks was affected by kinship, indicating that kin associations result from a preference to flock with relatives rather than a constraint on flocking with nonrelatives. Finally, using social network analysis, we show that fine-scale nonbreeding associations among individuals were positively related to kinship, and that these nonbreeding associations were reflected in helping decisions in the subsequent breeding season, in addition to the previously reported effects of kinship and proximity. We conclude that long-tailed tits prefer to associate with kin when not breeding, and suggest that by doing so they gain either nepotistic benefits within flocks or future indirect benefits during breeding. © 2016","Aegithalos caudatus; cooperative breeding; helper; kin neighbourhood; kin selection; long-tailed tit; relatedness; social network; winter flock","aggression; cooperative behavior; fitness; kin selection; kinship; neighborhood; passerine; relatedness; reproductive behavior; social behavior; social network; social organization; species flock; Aegithalidae; Aegithalos caudatus; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991687641

Whereas traditional epidemiological models typically assume no social structure, network theory suggests that an individual's location in the network determines its risk of infection. Empirical, especially experimental, studies of disease spread on networks are lacking, however, largely due to a shortage of amenable study systems. We used automated video-tracking to quantify networks of physical contact among individuals within colonies of the social bumble bee Bombus impatiens. We explored the effects of network structure on pathogen transmission in naturally and artificially infected hives. We show for the first time that contact network structure determines the spread of a contagious pathogen (Crithidia bombi) in social insect colonies. Differences in rates of infection among colonies resulted largely from differences in network density among hives. Within colonies, a bee's rate of contact with infected nestmates emerged as the only significant predictor of infection risk. The activity of bees, in terms of their movement rates and division of labour (e.g., brood care, nest care, foraging), did not influence risk of infection. Our results suggest that contact networks may have an important influence on the transmission of pathogens in social insects and, possibly, other social animals. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","Disease ecology; Epidemiology; Infection; Social insects","bee; colony; disease spread; disease transmission; epidemiology; infectious disease; pathogen; social insect; social network; analysis of variance; animal; article; bee; comparative study; contact examination; Crithidia; disease transmission; methodology; motor activity; parasitology; social environment; videorecording; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Bees; Contact Tracing; Crithidia; Disease Transmission, Horizontal; Motor Activity; Social Environment; Video Recording; Animalia; Apoidea; Bombus (genus); Bombus impatiens; Crithidia; Crithidia bombi; Hexapoda; Impatiens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35948930212

However, knowledge of the ensuing infection-activated signaling networks in both host and pathogen and their interspecific crosstalk during the innate and adaptive phases of the infection processes remains incomplete. In the present study, dynamic network modeling, protein interaction databases, and dual transcriptome data from zebrafish and C. albicans during infection were used to infer infectionactivated host-pathogen dynamic interaction networks. The consideration of host-pathogen dynamic interaction systems as innate and adaptive loops and subsequent comparisons of inferred innate and adaptive networks indicated previously unrecognized crosstalk between known pathways and suggested roles of immunological memory in the coordination of host defensive and offensive molecular mechanisms to achieve specific and powerful defense against pathogens. Moreover, pathogens enhance intraspecific crosstalk and abrogate host apoptosis to accommodate enhanced host defense mechanisms during the adaptive phase. Accordingly, links between physiological phenomena and changes in the coordination of defensive and offensive molecular mechanisms highlight the importance of host-pathogen molecular interaction networks, and consequent inferences of the host-pathogen relationship could be translated into biomedical applications. © 2016 Wu, Chen.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"transcriptome; adaptive immunity; apoptosis; Article; Candida albicans; down regulation; host pathogen interaction; host resistance; immunological memory; innate immunity; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; nonhuman; protein database; protein interaction; protein protein interaction; systems biology; upregulation; zebra fish; animal; host pathogen interaction; immunology; microbiology; physiology; procedures; species difference; systems biology; Animals; Candida albicans; Down-Regulation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Immunity, Innate; Immunologic Memory; Species Specificity; Systems Biology; Up-Regulation; Zebrafish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960492025

Although transmission is thought to be highly heterogeneous in both space and time, little is known about the patterns and drivers of transmission in groups of houses in endemic settings. We carried out surveys of PCR positivity in children residing in 2-block patches of highly endemic cities of Colombia. We found high levels of heterogeneity in PCR positivity, varying from less than 30% in 8 of the 10 patches to 56 and 96%, with the latter patch containing 22 children simultaneously PCR positive (PCR22) for DEN2. We then used an agent-based model to assess the likely eco-epidemiological context of this observation. Our model, simulating daily dengue dynamics over a 20 year period in a single two block patch, suggests that the observed heterogeneity most likely derived from variation in the density of susceptible people. Two aspects of human adaptive behavior were critical to determining this density: external social relationships favoring viral introduction (by susceptible residents or infectious visitors) and immigration of households from non-endemic areas. External social relationships generating frequent viral introduction constituted a particularly strong constraint on susceptible densities, thereby limiting the potential for explosive outbreaks and dampening the impact of heightened vectorial capacity. Dengue transmission can be highly explosive locally, even in neighborhoods with significant immunity in the human population. Variation among neighborhoods in the density of local social networks and rural-to-urban migration is likely to produce significant fine-scale heterogeneity in dengue dynamics, constraining or amplifying the impacts of changes in mosquito populations and cross immunity between serotypes. © 2015 Padmanabha et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"adaptive behavior; Article; child; Colombia; controlled study; demography; dengue; disease predisposition; endemic disease; environmental exposure; epidemic; high risk population; human; immigration; infection risk; major clinical study; neighborhood; polymerase chain reaction; risk assessment; social behavior; social interaction; social network; virus transmission; Aedes; animal; blood; dengue; Dengue virus; insect vector; pathogenicity; population density; population dynamics; transmission; virology; virus RNA; Aedes; Animals; Child; Colombia; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Insect Vectors; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Residence Characteristics; RNA, Viral; Social Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956666377

We report results from field calibration and deployment tests of miniaturized proximity tags (Encounternet), digital transceivers that log encounters between tagged individuals. We examined radio signal behavior in relation to tag attachment (tag, tag on bird, tag on saline-filled balloon) to understand how radio signal strength is affected by the tag mounting technique used for calibration tests. We investigated inter-tag and inter-receiver station variability, and in each calibration test we accounted for the effects of antennae orientation. Additionally, we used data from a live deployment on breeding barn swallows (Hirundo rustica erythrogaster) to analyze the quality of the logs, including reciprocal agreement in dyadic logs. We evaluated the impact (in terms of mass changes) of tag attachment on the birds. We were able to statistically distinguish between RSSI values associated with different close-proximity (<5m) tag-tag distances regardless of antennae orientation. Inter-tag variability was low, but we did find significant inter-receiver station variability. Reciprocal agreement of dyadic logs was high and social networks were constructed from proximity tag logs based on two different RSSI thresholds. There was no evidence of significant mass loss in the time birds were wearing tags. We conclude that proximity loggers are accurate and effective for quantifying social behavior. However, because RSSI and distance cannot be perfectly resolved, data from proximity loggers are most appropriate for comparing networks based on specific RSSI thresholds. The Encounternet system is flexible and customizable, and tags are now light enough for use on small animals (<50g).

Male-typical behaviors are often reduced after exposure, suggesting that exposure may have population-level effects. One way in which exposure may exert population-level effects is by interfering with communication within a network of individuals. Acute exposure to the estrogen mimic 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) disrupts the ability of male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens, to modify their behavior during male-male interactions when an audience is present. However, it is unknown whether audience effects during male-female interactions may be similarly altered. To examine this, male-female pairs that were given an acute exposure to EE2 or remained unexposed interacted in the presence of a female, male, or no audience. Sex differences were found between unexposed males and females. More interactant-directed gill flaring was displayed by control males when a male audience was present while control females performed this behavior more in the presence of an audience, regardless of sex. Both males and females in the control group performed more interactant-directed tail beats in the presence of a female audience. EE2 exposure made all audience effects disappear as treated males and females did not differ in their responses between audience types. These results demonstrate that acute exposure to EE2 may disrupt behavioral adjustments to audience type within a social network. This disruption may, in turn, influence population dynamics in this species as both males and females use information obtained from observing interactions in later encounters with the observed individuals. © 2015.","Audience effects; Communication networks; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Estrogen mimic; Siamese fighting fish","ethinylestradiol; ethinylestradiol; behavioral response; communication behavior; endocrine disruptor; estrogenic compound; perciform; pollution exposure; population dynamics; sex-related difference; social network; aggressiveness; animal behavior; Article; Betta splendens; competitive ability; controlled study; courtship; female; male; mate choice; nonhuman; pair bonding; Perciformes; sex difference; sexual behavior; social interaction; social network; aggression; animal; animal behavior; drug effects; human relation; Perciformes; physiology; sexual development; social behavior; Betta splendens; Macropodinae; Aggression; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Ethinyl Estradiol; Female; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Perciformes; Sex Characteristics; Social Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922960226

The southern Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) has developed a highly specialized form of paternal care known as neomelia, in which males ingest developing embryos and transport them in their vocal sacs until metamorphosis is completed. Based on the main components of territoriality described in amphibians: site fidelity, resource limitation and defence (e.g. of oviposition sites and egg clutches), we hypothesized that R. darwinii males exhibit territoriality. To investigate this, we used a multi-method approach that involved estimating home range and movements, performing social network analyses and monitoring potential egg attendance. Forty-five individual frogs and three egg clutches were monitored in a population from southern Chile between December 2010 and February 2011. Site fidelity was found across all groups (juveniles, females, non-brooding males and brooding males) based on small movements between captures (mean±1 se; 0.96±0.11m) and small net displacement (2.95±0.55m). Home ranges were small (1.82±0.54m; range: 0.1-16m2) and did not differ significantly among groups. We did not find evidence of male territoriality, instead male frogs exhibited high home range overlapping and intra-group association. No frogs of either sex were ever seen attending eggs. This evidence supports Wells' suggestion; territoriality in anuran species with parental care should be expected only if males defend oviposition sites. Conversely, females did not exhibit home range overlapping and showed evidence of very low intra-group association. This study has thrown up a range of additional questions with regard to temporal segregation between non-brooding males, the roles of male and female calls during reproduction, potential female territoriality and what kind of signals triggers egg ingestion by males. © 2014 The Zoological Society of London.","Egg attendance; Neomelia; Parental care; Rhinoderma darwinii; Social network","Anura; Rhinoderma darwinii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84915759731

In this study, we aimed to investigate seasonal patterns in the association between the movement of live poultry originating from southern China and HPAIV H5N1 infection history in humans and poultry in China. Methodology/Principal Findings: During January to April 2010, longitudinal questionnaire surveys were carried out monthly in four wholesale live bird markets (LBMs) in Hunan and Guangxi provinces of South China. Using social network analysis, we found an increase in the number of observed links and degree centrality between LBMs and poultry sources in February and March compared to the months of January and April. The association of some live poultry traders (LPT's) with a limited set of counties (within the catchment area of LBMs) in the months of February and March may support HPAIV H5N1 transmission and contribute to perpetuating HPAIV H5N1 virus circulation among certain groups of counties. The connectivity among counties experiencing human infection was significantly higher compared to counties without human infection for the months of January, March and April. Conversely, counties with poultry infections were found to be significantly less connected than counties without poultry infection for the month of February. Conclusions/Significance: Our results show that temporal variation in live poultry trade in Southern China around the Chinese New Year festivities is associated with higher HPAIV H5N1 infection risk in humans and poultry. This study has shown that capturing the dynamic nature of poultry trade networks in Southern China improves our ability to explain the spatiotemporal dissemination in avian influenza viruses in China. © 2012 Soares Magalhães et al.",,"article; China; geographic distribution; geographical variation (species); high risk population; human; human activities; infection risk; influenza A (H5N1); Influenza virus A H5N1; market; nonhuman; poultry farming; risk assessment; seasonal variation; social network; virus transmission; Animals; China; Disease Outbreaks; Holidays; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H5N1 Subtype; Influenza in Birds; Influenza, Human; Poultry; Seasons; Socioeconomic Factors; Aves; Avian influenza virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869216632

Studies rarely examine if females have this ability outside of mate choice. Additionally, it is unknown if familiarity differs when females encounter females versus males. Female Siamese fighting fish were placed into one of six treatment groups that differed based on the sex of the interactant (female or male) and experience (familiar, unfamiliar or no previous exposure). In both female-female and female-male interactions, less behaviour was performed towards familiar individuals. However, the degree to which familiarity had an effect differed depending on the sex of the interactant and the behaviour measured. Familiarity may serve an important function if it increases an individual's ability to remember the outcome of prior encounters and use this information in later encounters with the same individual. To fully understand social dynamics, both sexes must be examined. © 2017 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","familiarity effects; female-female interactions; female-male interactions; Siamese fighting fish; social behavior",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009106009

The presence of noise can have multiple direct and indirect effects on communication. Noise can directly mask signals leading to reduced detection and recognition. Noise also affects internal physiological processes which can influence attention and decision rules and, thus, indirectly affect communication. Also community effects of noise leading to lower densities or different community composition with respect to copying style or personality will affect communication through different communication distances and different daily behavioural routines. All these direct and indirect effects of noise on communication have been well documented but often are treated separately. This review focusses on some of the indirect effects of noise on animal communication, considering spatial responses, attentional effects and differential effects of noise depending on an animal's characteristics, its personality. It evaluates how noise can indirectly influence communication and, thus, social network structure and processes of sexual and natural selection. © 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","acoustic communication; attention; noise disturbance; noise pollution",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877605605

Many epidemics have recently been reported in the most important salmon farming regions of the world, including Chile (2007-2009), where ISAV generated the most important disease and economic crisis in history of the salmon industry of the country. The spread of ISAV within a region is most likely by local or neighborhood spread from an infected farm; however, there is evidence that anthropogenic activities, such as movement of live or harvested fish or their byproduct, may have played a more important role than environmental or passive transmission in the 2007-2009 outbreak. Atlantic salmon farms (n=421) were retrospectively followed from stocking to harvesting in southern Chile at the time of the ISAV epidemic (2007-2009). The effect of husbandry and spatial risk factors, in addition to contact-network risk factors, which were obtained from the social network analyses, on time to first ISAV infection was estimated using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Five variables were retained in the final fitted model: co-existing multiple generations on a farm (hazard ratio [HR]=2.585), mean smolt weight at stocking greater than 120g (HR=1.165), farm area (perkm2) (HR=1.005), and increased number of shipments entering a farm, i.e. the farm input degree (HR=1.876) were associated with reduced time to infection; whereas time-to-infection was longer for farms located farther from an ongoing ISAV outbreak (HR=0.943). It was demonstrated that movements of latently infected fish resulted in approximately 7 outbreaks, and potentially explain about 6% of the total number of cases during the epidemic. Results from this study provide new information about the mechanisms of spread of ISAV in one the largest documented ISAV epidemics in the world. Findings may be used to support the design and implementation of risk-based surveillance and control programs that may help to prevent, detect and control future ISAV outbreaks. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Chile; Infectious salmon anemia; ISAV; Salmon farming; Social network analysis","animal; animal disease; aquaculture; article; Atlantic salmon; Chile; disease transmission; epidemic; fish disease; infectious salmon anemia; ISAV; Orthomyxovirus; orthomyxovirus infection; physiology; proportional hazards model; risk factor; Salmon farming; social network analysis; spatial analysis; virology; Chile; Infectious salmon anemia; ISAV; Salmon farming; Social network analysis; Animals; Aquaculture; Chile; Epidemics; Fish Diseases; Isavirus; Orthomyxoviridae Infections; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Salmo salar; Spatial Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84894681127

Although conservation of summer maternity habitat is considered critical for forestroosting bats, bat response to roost loss still is poorly understood. To address this, we monitored 3 northern long-eared bat (Myotis septentrionalis) maternity colonies on Fort Knox Military Reservation, Kentucky, USA, before and after targeted roost removal during the dormant season when bats were hibernating in caves. We used 2 treatments: removal of a single highly used (primary) roost and removal of 24% of less used (secondary) roosts, and an un-manipulated control. Neither treatment altered the number of roosts used by individual bats, but secondary roost removal doubled the distances moved between sequentially used roosts. However, overall space use by and location of colonies was similar pre- and post-treatment. Patterns of roost use before and after removal treatments also were similar but bats maintained closer social connections after our treatments. Roost height, diameter at breast height, percent canopy openness, and roost species composition were similar pre- and post-treatment. We detected differences in the distribution of roosts among decay stages and crown classes pre- and post-roost removal, but this may have been a result of temperature differences between treatment years. Our results suggest that loss of a primary roost or - 20%≤of secondary roosts in the dormant season may not cause northern longeared bats to abandon roosting areas or substantially alter some roosting behaviors in the following active season when tree-roosts are used. Critically, tolerance limits to roost loss may be dependent upon local forest conditions, and continued research on this topic will be necessary for conservation of the northern long-eared bat across its range.",,"Article; bat; canopy; controlled study; female; hibernation; nonhuman; northern long eared bat; organism colony; roost; seasonal variation; social interaction; social network; social structure; species composition; species habitat; United States; animal; animal behavior; bat; ecosystem; male; physiology; social behavior; Myotis septentrionalis; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Chiroptera; Ecosystem; Female; Male; Social Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921807621

However, as species distributions shift due to ocean warming, acidification, and oxygen depletion from climate change, the areas originally designated under MPAs may bear little resemblance to their past state. Different approaches have been suggested for coping with species on the move in conservation. Here, we test the effectiveness of different MPA designs, including dynamic, network, and different directional orientations on protecting shifting species under climate change through ecosystem modeling in a theoretical ecosystem. Our findings suggest that dynamic MPAs may benefit some species (e.g., whiting and anchovy) and fishing fleets, and these benefits can inform the design or adaptation of MPAs worldwide. In addition, we find that it is important to design MPAs with specific goals and to account for the effects of released fishing pressure and species interactions in MPA design. © 2020 Public Library of Science.

In this study, we describe associations between agonistic behaviour and male reproductive success in stable social groups of bluebanded gobies (Lythrypnus dalli). This highly social, sex-changing species forms linear hierarchies of a dominant male and multiple subordinate females. Males reproduce with each female in the harem and care for the eggs. Since aggression tends to be associated with reduced reproduction in social hierarchies, we hypothesized that males in groups with high rates of aggression would fertilise fewer eggs. We also hypothesized that a male's agonistic behaviour would be associated with his reproductive success. Dominants often exert substantial control over their harem, including control over subordinate reproduction. To address these hypotheses, we quantified egg laying/fertilisation over 13 days and observed agonistic behaviour. We show that there was a significant, negative association between male reproductive success and the total rate agonistic interactions by a group. While no male behaviours were associated with the quantity of eggs fertilised, female agonistic behaviour may be central to male reproductive success. We identified a set of models approximating male reproductive success that included three female behaviours: aggression by the highest-ranking female and approaches by the lowest-ranking female were negatively associated with the quantity of eggs fertilised by males in their groups, but the efficiency with which the middle-ranking female displaced others was positively associated with this measure. These data provide a first step in elucidating the behavioural mechanisms that are associated with L. dalli reproductive success. © Copyright 2014 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands.","agonistic behaviour; agonistic efficiency; fish; individual variation; reproductive success; social hierarchy","Lythrypnus dalli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84907638034

Thus, to fully address the hypotheses about the role of social associations it is imperative to consider the multidimensional nature of sociality by explicitly examining social associations across multiple scales and contexts. We simultaneously recorded > 8000 associations from 85% of breeding individuals from a colony of Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) over a 2-week period, and examined gregariousness across four foraging states using multilayer social network analysis. We found that social associations varied in a context-dependent manner, highlighting that social associations are most prevalent during foraging (local enhancement) and in regions expected to provide clustered resources. We also provide evidence of individual consistency in gregariousness, but flexibility in social associates, demonstrating that individuals can adjust their social behaviours to match experienced conditions. © 2020 The Authors.

These networks are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant-pollinator and 24 plant-frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant-animal mutualistic networks (65.6%) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2%) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant-animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs.","Biodiversity; Coevolution; Ecological networks; Food web structure; Pollination; Seed-dispersal","coevolution; mutualism; pollination; pollinator; seed dispersal; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037266152

Though they appear to be far removed, childhood conditions are known to be inextricably linked with adult health, and in turn on health in later life. The long arm of childhood conditions hypothesis is often tested using recollection of childhood circumstances, but such subjective recall can yield potentially inaccurate or possibly biased inferences. We tested the long arm hypothesis on three outcomes in later life, arrayed from objective to subjective health, namely: gait speed, episodic memory and mental health. Methods and Findings We used the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing 2006 enriched with retrospective life history (N = 5,913). To deal with recall problems two solutions, covariate measurement and endogenous treatment models, were applied. Retrospective childhood material lack includes growing up without running hot or cold water, fixed bath, indoor lavatory and central heating. Adjustment is made for an extensive set of confounders including sex, age, adult health, wealth, education, occupation, social support, social connections, chronic conditions, smoking, drinking, and physical exercise. It is found that material poverty when growing up shows no association with health when growing old, assuming accurate recall. Once recall problems are controlled, we found that childhood material poverty changes inversely with later life health.

Knowledge of these communities’ social adaptive capacity is critical to inform climate adaptation planning and fisheries management in the region. The present study examines social adaptive capacity in four fishing communities in the Federated States of Micronesia and Guam. Researchers used a framework based on five social adaptive capacity factors (diversity and flexibility, access to assets, learning and knowledge, governance and institutions, and agency) to develop indicators that were relevant to the study sites and conducted 262 household surveys, seven focus groups with 45 participants, and 25 key informant interviews. A combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses shows: high levels of livelihood flexibility and perceived agency to address climate risks; social networks as most vital community asset; significant utility of traditional knowledge combined with scientific information; and, the need for governments and leadership to develop effective sustainable fisheries governance that prevents further fisheries resource degradation and helps develop alternative sustainable livelihoods for fishers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Fisheries; Fisheries management; Micronesia; Social adaptive capacity","adaptive management; fishery management; fishery policy; fishing community; food security; governance approach; local government; sustainability; Guam; Mariana Islands; Micronesia; Martes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103760343

To address these needs, we investigate the impacts of multiple economic sectors on the marine ecosystem and dependent human community in the Gulf of California with an ecological-economic model. We focus on the spotted rose snapper (Lutjanus guttatus), an economically important species targeted concurrently by the nearshore artisanal fleet, the sportfishing fleet, and by the industrial shrimp fleet as bycatch. Economic returns to the local community are driven by the artisanal fishery catch and the number of tourists who engage in the sportsfishery, and these variables are in turn impacted by fish abundance. We find that the coexistence of the two sectors (and production of both seafood and tourism services) creates stability in key elements of the coupled systems. When the coupled systems are perturbed by changes in exploitation and climate variability, the artisanal fishery responds more rapidly and to a greater degree than the sportsfishery to shifts in the fish population. Our results suggest that vital components of coupled systems may well respond differently to climate variability or other perturbations, and that management strategies should be developed with this in mind. Models like ours can facilitate the development and testing of hypotheses about the form and strength of interactions between ecosystems, services, and the human communities that rely on them. © 2009 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Ecological-economics; Ecosystem-based management; Fisheries; Marine ecosystem services; Modeling; Social-ecological system; Trade-offs","anthropogenic effect; artisanal fishery; bycatch; climate variation; commercial species; ecological impact; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; environmental economics; fishery management; marine ecosystem; perciform; social impact; trade-environment relations; trade-off; Gulf of California; Pacific Ocean; Decapoda (Crustacea); Lutjanus guttatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67349128919

Piscivory by fish is a dominant factor in both stream and lake systems whereas evidence for the importance of competition appears less convincing. Within small streams or lakes, the impact of predation may exclude other species, thereby leading to mutually exclusive distributions and strong differences in community composition. Within a geographic region, abiotic effects frequently dictate the relative importance of piscivory, thereby indirectly influencing the composition of prey species present. The spatial scale of studies influences our perceived importance of biotic versus abiotic factors, with small-scale studies indicating a greater importance of competition and large-scale studies emphasizing abiotic controls. The scale of the individual sites considered is critical because smaller systems have higher variability and wider extremes of conditions than larger lakes and rivers. The stability of physical systems and degree of spatial connectivity contribute to increased diversity in both larger stream and larger lake systems.

In social insects the acceptance of other individuals as nestmates can involve a variety of different cues, but the relative importance of these cues can change in relation to the fitness costs of accepting or rejecting other individuals. In this study we investigate the mechanisms that underlie recognition behaviour in Argentine ants (Linepithema humile). Introduced populations of Argentine ants are characterized by a social structure known as unicoloniality where intraspecific aggression is absent over large distances resulting in the formation of expansive supercolonies. Recent research has identified sites where multiple, mutually aggressive supercolonies co-occur allowing an examination of Argentine ant behaviour at territorial boundaries. We found that workers from different supercolonies always interact aggressively with one another, but that neighbours from different colonies (i.e., workers from nests located in the immediate vicinity of territory borders) consistently exhibited higher levels of aggression compared to those displayed by non-neighbours from different colonies (i.e., workers from nests located far enough away from a territory border so that interactions are unlikely). This difference in the level of aggression displayed between neighbours and between non-neighbours from different supercolonies cannot be explained by differences in relatedness or genetic similarity. Instead our findings suggest that direct contact between mutually antagonistic colonies is sufficient to elevate aggression. A laboratory experiment in which we manipulated the extent to which colonies with no prior history of contact could interact with one another, revealed that aggression increased after colonies were permitted to interact, but dropped after connections between colonies were severed. Moreover, the mere presence of an aggressive supercolony was sufficient to elicit elevated aggression. Overall these patterns are opposite to the ""dear enemy"" phenomenon and could be the result of the intense territorial aggression exhibited by established supercolonies of this species. © 2007 Birkhäuser Verlag.","Context-dependent; Dear enemy; Genetic relatedness; Nestmate recognition; Territory border","ant; antagonism; colony; dear enemy phenomenon; intraspecific interaction; introduced species; nestmate recognition; relatedness; social insect; social organization; social structure; territoriality; Hexapoda; Linepithema humile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548019222

The second example explores how a parasitic wasp uses the host's immune/neural communication system to control host behavior.

However, it is largely unknown how ovaries influence behavior. To address this question, we first performed transcriptional profiling on worker ovaries from two genotypes that differ in social behavior and ovary size. Then, we contrasted the differentially expressed ovarian genes with six sets of available brain transcriptomes. Finally, we probed behavior-related candidate gene networks in wild-type ovaries of different sizes. We found differential expression in 2151 ovarian transcripts in these artificially selected honey bee strains, corresponding to approximately 20.3% of the predicted gene set of honey bees. Differences in gene expression overlapped significantly with changes in the brain transcriptomes. Differentially expressed genes were associated with neural signal transmission (tyramine receptor, TYR) and ecdysteroid signaling; two independently tested nuclear hormone receptors (HR46 and ftz-f1) were also significantly correlated with ovary size in wild-type bees. We suggest that the correspondence between ovary and brain transcriptomes identified here indicates systemic regulatory networks among hormones (juvenile hormone and ecdysteroids), pheromones (queen mandibular pheromone), reproductive organs and nervous tissues in worker honey bees. Furthermore, robust correlations between ovary size and neural- and endocrine response genes are consistent with the hypothesized roles of the ovaries in honey bee behavioral regulation. © 2012.

Although management actions aimed at mitigating effects of habitat loss and predation have been largely effective, numbers continue to decline, which suggests that the population may be limited during the nonbreeding season. Between 2013 and 2015, we used light-level geolocators to track Common Terns nesting at 5 inland colonies--from Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada, to the eastern Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada--to identify migratory routes and stopover and wintering sites and to determine the strength of migratory connectivity among colonies. Within 46 recovered tracks, we found evidence of a longitudinal gradient in use of migration routes and stopover sites among colonies and identified major staging areas in the lower Great Lakes and at inland and coastal locations along the Atlantic coast, Florida, and the Gulf of Mexico. Low migratory connectivity across inland colonies illustrates high intermixing within wintering sites, with many birds spending the nonbreeding season in Peru (70%) and the remainder spread throughout the Gulf of Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America. While the large spatial spread and intermixing of individuals during the nonbreeding season may buffer local effects of climate change and human disturbance, the aggregation of individuals along the coast of Peru could make them vulnerable to events or changes within this region, such as increased frequency and intensity of storms in the Pacific, that are predicted to negatively influence breeding productivity and survival of Common Terns. Identifying sources of mortality during the nonbreeding season, quantifying winter site fidelity, and reinforcing the importance of continued management of inland breeding colonies are vital priorities for effective conservation and management of this vulnerable population. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.","ENSO; geolocation by light; migratory connectivity; seabirds; Sterna hirundo","El Nino-Southern Oscillation; migration route; migratory behavior; nesting; seabird; stopover; winter; Canada; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Winnipeg; Manitoba; United States; Aves; Sterna hirundo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044998482

Predatory freshwater fishes, such as Northern Pike Esox lucius, commonly exhibit small population sizes, and several local populations are considered endangered. Pike inhabit diverse habitat types, including lakes, rivers and brackish marine waters, thus spanning from small isolated patches to large open marine systems. However, pike population structure from local to regional scales is relatively poorly described, in spite of its significance to developing conservation measures. We analysed microsatellite variation in a total of 1185 North European pike from 46 samples collected across both local and regional scales, as well as over time, to address two overarching questions: Is pike population structure associated with local and/or regional connectivity patterns, and which factors likely have the main influence on the contemporary distribution of genetic diversity? To answer this, we combined estimators of population diversity and structure to assess evidence of whether populations within (i) habitats, (ii) drainage systems and (iii) geographical regions are closer related than among these ranges, and whether patterns are temporally stable. Contrasting previous predictions that genetic drift obscures signals of postglacial colonisation history, we identified clear regional differences in population genetic signatures, suggesting a major effect of drainage divides on colonisation history and connectivity. However, several populations deviated from the general pattern, showing that local processes may be complex and need to be examined case-by-case. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Baltic sea; Dispersal; Landscape genetics; Postglacial recolonisation; Temporal stability","Esox lucius; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924803740

How does an animal rapidly detect, process, and then respond to these social transitions? This article explores and summarizes how these social transitions can rapidly (within 24 h) impact an individual's behavior, physiology, and brain, using the African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, as a model. Male A. burtoni form hierarchies in which a few brightly-colored dominant males defend territories and spawn with females, while the remaining males are subordinate, more drab-colored, do not hold a territory, and have minimal opportunities for reproduction. These social phenotypes are plastic and reversible, meaning that individual males may switch between dominant and subordinate status multiple times within a lifetime. When the social environment is manipulated to create males that either ascend (subordinate to dominant) or descend (dominant to subordinate) in rank, there are rapid changes in behavior, circulating hormones, and levels of gene expression in the brain that reflect the direction of transition. For example, within minutes, males ascending in status show bright coloration, a distinct eye-bar, increased dominance behaviors, activation of brain nuclei in the social behavior network, and higher levels of sex steroids in the plasma. Ascending males also show rapid changes in levels of neuropeptide and steroid receptors in the brain, as well as in the pituitary and testes. To further examine hormone-behavior relationships in this species during rapid social ascent, the present study also measured levels of testosterone, 11-ketotestosterone, estradiol, progestins, and cortisol in the plasma during the first week of social ascent and tested for correlations with behavior. Plasma levels of all steroids were rapidly increased at 30 min after social ascent, but were not correlated with behavior during the initial rise in rank, suggesting that behavior is dissociated from endocrine status. These changes during social ascent are then compared with our current knowledge about males descending in rank, who rapidly show faded coloration, decreased dominance behaviors, increased subordinate behaviors, and higher circulating levels of cortisol. Collectively, this work highlights how the perception of similar social cues that are opposite in value are rapidly translated into adaptive behavioral and neuroendocrine changes that promote survival and reproductive fitness. Finally, future directions are proposed to better understand the mechanisms that govern these rapid changes in social position. © 2015 The Author 2015.

We discovered an aquatic insect that migrates between a river mainstem and its tributaries, and provides an important trophic subsidy for tributary predators. A mayfly, Ephemerella maculata, rears in a warm, sunlit productive river mainstem, then migrates as adults to cool, shaded unproductive tributaries where they oviposit and die. This migration tripled insect flux into a tributary for 1 month in summer. A manipulative field experiment showed that this E. maculata subsidy nearly tripled the growth of the young of the year steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the recipient tributary over the summer months, and was more important than terrestrial invertebrate subsidies, which have been considered the primary food source for predators in small, forested creeks. By delivering food subsidies from productive but warming river mainstems to cool but food-limited tributaries, aquatic insect migrations could enhance resilience to cool-water predators in warming river networks. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd/CNRS.","Aquatic insect; Ecological resilience; Food web; Landscape; Migration; River network; Salmonid; Spatial connectivity; Subsidy; Warming","aquatic community; connectivity; ecosystem resilience; field method; food web; landscape change; mayfly; migration; predator; predator-prey interaction; river system; salmonid; tributary; warming; Animalia; Ephemerella maculata; Ephemeroptera; Hexapoda; Invertebrata; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmonidae; animal; ecosystem; Ephemeroptera; food chain; growth, development and aging; Oncorhynchus mykiss; physiology; population migration; river; temperature; United States; Animal Migration; Animals; California; Ecosystem; Ephemeroptera; Food Chain; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Rivers; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84941023881

Human enteric pathogens, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella, have been implicated in numerous food poisoning outbreaks associated with the consumption of fresh produce. An understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the establishment of pathogenic bacteria in or on vegetable plants is critical for understanding and ameliorating this problem as well as ensuring the safety of our food supply. While previous studies have described the growth and survival of enteric pathogens in the environment and also the risk factors associated with the contamination of vegetables, the molecular events involved in the colonization of fresh produce by enteric pathogens are just beginning to be elucidated. This review summarizes recent findings on the interactions of several bacterial pathogens with leafy green vegetables. Changes in gene expression linked to the bacterial attachment and colonization of plant structures are discussed in light of their relevance to plant-microbe interactions. We propose a mechanism for the establishment and association of enteric pathogens with plants and discuss potential strategies to address the problem of foodborne illness linked to the consumption of leafy green vegetables.","Food safety; Foodborne pathogens; Fresh produce; Lettuce; Transcriptome","animal; Enterobacteriaceae; Escherichia coli O157; food contamination; food poisoning; food safety; gene expression regulation; growth, development and aging; host pathogen interaction; human; insect vector; microbiology; physiology; plant leaf; plant seed; vegetable; Animals; Enterobacteriaceae; Escherichia coli O157; Food Contamination; Food Safety; Foodborne Diseases; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Insect Vectors; Plant Leaves; Seeds; Soil Microbiology; Vegetables",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84904569344

To address these limitations, we propose a novel concept of a standardised ‘ecosystem observatory module’ structure composed of a central node and three tethered satellite pods together with permanent mobile platforms. The module would be designed with a rigid spatial configuration to optimise overlap among multiple observation technologies, each providing 360° coverage of a cylindrical or hemi-spherical volume around the module, including permanent stereo video cameras, acoustic imaging sonar cameras, horizontal multibeam echosounders, and a passive acoustic array. The incorporation of multiple integrated observation technologies would enable unprecedented quantification of macrofaunal composition, abundance, and density surrounding the module, as well as the ability to track the movements of individual fishes and macroinvertebrates. Such a standardised modular design would allow for the hierarchical spatial connection of observatory modules into local module clusters and larger geographic module networks providing synoptic data within and across linked ecosystems suitable for fisheries and ecosystem-level monitoring on multiple scales. © S.

We characterised the genetic structure of the endemic and endangered New Zealand (NZ) long-tailed bat (Chalinolobus tuberculatus) in two valleys in Fiordland, NZ. Fiordland is one of the last strongholds of the species, which has drastically declined throughout NZ. C. tuberculatus has suffered from recent habitat fragmentation and episodic predation by exotic mammals over the last 150 years. Gene flow and structuring were measured using nine nuclear microsatellite loci. In addition, the hyper-variable domain HVI of the mitochondrial control region was sequenced to analyse population structure at the maternal level. Our results show that the nine colonies studied have retained high genetic diversity, with moderate signs of genetic bottlenecks. Furthermore, low FST and FIS values indicated that all colonies are still connected by gene flow and do not show signs of inbreeding. Substantial gene flow among colonies was also demonstrated by Bayesian clustering and PCA analysis. At the mitochondrial level, substantial differentiation between colonies has resulted from strong natal philopatry in females. Overall, our results indicate that genetic diversity is maintained in the Fiordland population of C. tuberculatus despite regular population crashes and habitat fragmentation. Management should ensure that remaining habitat linkages are preserved and further predator-induced population bottlenecks are prevented so that current genetic diversity is maintained in the long-term. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Bottleneck; Chiroptera; Dispersal; Invasive species; Islands; Population genetics","bat; dispersal; endangered species; endemic species; genetic structure; genetic variation; habitat conservation; invasive species; population bottleneck; species conservation; Fiordland; New Zealand; South Island; Southland; Chalinolobus tuberculatus; Chiroptera; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954387222

We intensively sampled colonies in close and remote (>10 km) proximity before and after targeted day-roost removal. Colonies were not necessarily composed of closely related individuals, although natal philopatry was common. Adjacent colonies often contained maternally related individuals, indicating that some pups did disperse, albeit not far from their natal home range. Whereas some young had been sired by males also collected on site, most had not, as would be expected since the species mates in fall near hibernacula across a wider landscape. The number of parentages that we inferred among colonies, however, suggests that outside the maternity season, social groups may be relatively flexible and open. Analysis of microsatellite DNA data showed a low FST (0.011) and best fit to a model of one multilocus genotypic cluster across the study area. We observed high turnover in colony membership between years in all colonies, regardless of roost-removal treatment.

Nest sanitation could be a prerequisite for the evolution of anti-parasite defence in terms of egg ejection. In this respect, we used nest sanitation behaviour as a tool to identify: i) motivation and its underlying function and, ii) which features provoke ejection behaviour. Therefore, we experimentally tested whether size, colour or shape may influence ejection behaviour using artificial flat objects. We found a high interclutch variation in egg colouration and egg size in our tree sparrow (Passer montanus) population. Using colour and size we were in fact able to predict clutch affiliation for each egg. Our experiments further revealed the existence of direct anti-parasite behaviours and birds are able to recognise conspecific eggs, since only experimentally-deposited eggs have been removed. Moreover, experiments with different objects revealed that the motivation of tree sparrows to remove experimental objects from their nests was highest during egg laying for objects of varying size, most likely because of parasitism risk at this breeding stage. In contrary, motivation to remove white objects and objects with edges was higher during incubation stage as behavioural patterns connected to hatching started to emerge. The fact that rejection rate of our flat objects was higher than real egg ejection, suggests that egg ejection in tree sparrows and probably more general in small passerines, to be limited by elevated costs to eject eggs with their beaks. The presence of anti-parasite behaviour supports our suggestion that brood parasitism causes variation in egg features, as we have found that tree sparrows can recognise and reject conspecific eggs in their clutch. In conclusion, in tree sparrows it seems that nest sanitation plays a key role in the evolution of the removal of parasitic eggs. © 2013 Poláček et al.",,"animal behavior; animal experiment; article; controlled study; defensive behavior; egg; egg laying; evolution; female; hatching; incubation time; motivation; nest sanitation; nesting; nonhuman; parasitism; sanitation; sparrow; Animals; Biological Evolution; Color; Female; Host-Parasite Interactions; Male; Models, Biological; Motivation; Nesting Behavior; Ovum; Parasites; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Reproduction; Sparrows; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892383485

Anatomical observations indicate that there are descending interneurones (DINs) originating in the SOG in addition to those from the brain. An SOG preparation for sampling both types of DIN intracellularly in walking locusts is described. Forty-three units showing activity changes during leg movements and walking were recorded. Using dye injection six were shown to be through-running axons; one was an SOG ascending interneurone; and eight were SOG DINs, 7 contralateral, one ipsilateral. All fired before or during movements and received various sensory inputs. Many gave complex responses to different modalities, several showing directional preferences. Some SOG neurones showed spontaneous changes in activity; activity outlasting movements; or responses to passive as well as active movements. These preliminary results suggest neuronal substrates for the special functions of the SOG in behaviour. They also indicate that DINs, rather than being simple relays, are part of a dynamic network which includes the motor centres. Regulation of complex and subtle aspects of behaviour may be achieved by dynamic and sequential patterns of activity in groups of DINs, some of which may be multifunctional. © 1984.","behaviour; descending interneurones; intracellular recording; Lucifer Yellow; Schistocerca gregaria; suboesophageal ganglion; walking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002513031

For this reason, animal behaviourists and disease ecologists have been interested in the intersection of their respective fields for decades. Despite this interest, most research at the behaviour-disease interface focuses either on how host behaviour affects parasites or how parasites affect behaviour, with little overlap between the two. Yet, the majority of interactions between hosts and parasites are probably reciprocal, such that host behaviour feeds back on parasites and vice versa. Explicitly considering these feedbacks is essential for understanding the complex connections between animal behaviour and parasite ecology and evolution. To illustrate this point, we discuss how host behaviour-parasite feedbacks might operate and explore the consequences of feedback for studies of animal behaviour and parasites. For example, ignoring the feedback of host social structure on parasite dynamics can limit the accuracy of predictions about parasite spread. Likewise, considering feedback in studies of parasites and animal personalities may provide unique insight about the maintenance of variation in personality types. Finally, applying the feedback concept to links between host behaviour and beneficial, rather than pathogenic, microbes may shed new light on transitions between mutualism and parasitism. More generally, accounting for host behaviour-parasite feedbacks can help identify critical gaps in our understanding of how key host behaviours and parasite traits evolve and are maintained. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Additionally, the activity of animals can be shaped by certain periods of their annual life cycle, like migration or breeding seasons. In the majority of bird species' -especially those with prolonged bi-parental care - it is possible to observe modifications in their daily behaviour during the breeding season. Birds involved in parental duties are forced to change their own activities according to the requirements of their offspring. As a consequence, the daily rhythm of their behaviours can vary between different phases of the breeding period. Moreover, each sex may respond individually to demands caused by parental duties. The degree of change in daily behaviour can help to explain the role of each sex in brood care. A time-budget analysis of different 11 breeding pairs of Mute Swan was performed in central Poland in the years of 2005- 2007. Here, the daily patterns of the following behaviours of both sexes were the subjects to analysis: incubation; nest (or sleeping platform) building/maintenance; movement; foraging; preening/comfort; resting/sleeping; alert/guarding and aggression. The study revealed a regular daily pattern of five activities (resting, comfort, movement, foraging and nest maintenance). Incubation was performed by females only and showed a defined daily pattern. Two behaviours -resting and nest maintenance - showed sex-related differences in daily rhythm. What is more, females modified their daily pattern of resting and nest maintenance during different phases of the breeding season (incubation vs. fledging phase). Males, on the other hand, did not change their pattern of daily activity during the entire breeding season.

Even so, the complex nature of environmental problems makes adaptive governance a far from straightforward task. In addition to the inherent complexity and unpredictability of the natural environment, social processes related to natural resources are often ridden with con?ict and feature great uncertainty regarding the substance of the problem, the strategies of other actors, and the overall institutions governing such processes (Koppenjan and Klijn, 2004). In striving for adaptability, governance is faced with various challenges originating from collective action problems, from the existence of divergent and competing interests, values, and problem de?nitions, and from the fact that ecological knowledge more often than not is contested (Olson, 1965; Hardin, 1968; Hoppe, 1999; Koppenjan and Klijn, 2004). These features signi?cantly aggravate the processes of reaching a joint image regarding the state of the resource and appropriate management rules, which is absolutely essential for adaptive management to evolve. Thus, the social challenges of adaptive governance are many. There is therefore a constant search - among both policy makers and researchers - for the type of governance system that can promote the rise and subsistence of social processes dealing with these challenges in an ef?cient way. © Cambridge University Press 2011.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84911404996

But what was the nature of this information? How did it influence behaviour? And how might the information in animal signals compare with the information in human language? Here we review evidence that signals in a variety of social contexts are adaptive because they convey information. For recipients, meaning results from the integration of information from the signal and the social context. As a result, communication in animals – particularly in long-lived, social species where the same individuals interact repeatedly – constitutes a rich system of pragmatic inference in which the meaning of a communicative event depends on perception, memory and social knowledge. In the human lineage, pragmatics served as a precursor to the later evolution of semantics and syntax. Among primates, there is a striking difference in flexibility between constrained call production and more flexible perception and cognition. However, call production is more flexible in the wild, where it is affected by contextual cues, than in laboratory studies where contextual cues have been removed. Monkeys and apes may overcome the limits of constrained vocal production by producing composite signals in the same and different modalities. © 2016 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","animal communication; evolution; information; language; social context","animal; cognition; communication behavior; evolutionary biology; perception; signal; social network; theoretical study; Animalia; Primates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992540105

In recent years, microorganisms have been increasingly recognised for their role in the health and overall performance of aquatic organisms, providing the aquaculture industry with a promising avenue for further success. Here, we review the literature on freshwater fish microbiology to evaluate the potential for microbial research to enhance freshwater aquaculture. A systematic review revealed that the existing freshwater fish microbiology literature incorporates <1% of freshwater fish species, with most studies focussed on Cyprinidae, Salmonidae and to a lesser extent Cichlidae. Using social network analyses, this review identified 25 key research areas commonly addressed in the existing literature highlighting the narrow focus of existing studies. Microbial community structure was the most frequently researched area, followed by environment and diet. These studies often evaluated microbiota changes associated with diadromous migrations, new technologies and advancements in feed formulations. However, research areas, such as the role of microorganisms in fish fecundity, omega-3 content, sustainability and palatability, were underrepresented in the literature despite their influence on aquaculture success. These underrepresented research areas are examples of where additional investments in microbial research are needed to ensure the continued expansion and success of freshwater aquaculture. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","aquaculture; microbiota; productivity; sustainability; systematic review",,Review,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103628172

Therefore, decisions such as which sites to protect, whether existing habitat should be restored or whether new habitat should be created, and where on the landscape management efforts should be focused present difficult challenges. An overarching goal of many conservation or management plans is the long-term persistence of populations, which is often dependent on functional connectivity and the maintenance of metapopulation dynamics. Graph theory and network approaches are frequently used tools for modeling functional connections between populations and between habitats. Less often, graph models are used to guide conservation or management decisions. We used spatial networks derived for an amphibian population to determine optimal locations to create new habitat, prioritize existing habitat for restoration, and determine the habitat most critical for maintaining connectivity within the existing metapopulation within Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, USA, 2012–2014. Using data collected at 206 breeding ponds over 3 years, we constructed demographic networks representing the functional connectivity between ponds by dispersing ringed salamanders (Ambystoma annulatum). We incorporated uncertainty in key model parameters through Monte Carlo simulation, and used a graph-theoretical parameterization of the metapopulation mean lifetime model to assess how changes in network structure affect persistence of the network. We conducted addition and removal experiments within our Monte Carlo simulations to rank and prioritize locations for pond creation, ponds for restoration, and ponds for preservation. Salamanders bred in 106 ponds in ≥1 year; 2.4% of ponds functioned predominantly as sources and 51% of occupied ponds functioned predominantly as sinks. The importance of a pond to the network was correlated with the number of emigrants dispersing from a pond, the number of ponds reached by these dispersers, and the frequency a pond functioned as a source. Creating new ponds at optimal locations increased the persistence of the network an average of 15.4% compared to randomly selected locations, whereas selective restoration of currently unoccupied ponds resulted in an average increase of 31.4% in network persistence, as compared to randomly selected unoccupied ponds. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we constructed biologically informed demographic connectivity networks for use as a spatial conservation or management planning tool. Although our approach was implemented with an amphibian and a breeding pond network, it is generalizable to any species occupying discrete habitat patches. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017","Ambystoma annulatum; amphibian; demographic networks; dispersal; functional connectivity; graph theory; metapopulation dynamics; source-sink","amphibian; conservation management; decision analysis; demographic survey; dispersal; ecological modeling; functional change; graphical method; habitat management; habitat restoration; management practice; metapopulation; optimization; pond; removal experiment; resource management; spatial analysis; Missouri; United States; Ambystoma annulatum; Amphibia; Salamandroidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044056239

Annual fluctuations in rainfall may affect parrot populations, but few studies address the impact of other stochastic or catastrophic events on their population dynamics. The Maroon-fronted Parrot Rhynchopsitta terrisi is an endangered species that nests colonially in cavities and crevices in limestone cliffs. From 1995 to 2010, we quantified Parrot attendance at nesting colonies throughout its breeding range, and reproductive output of nesting Parrots from 1997 to 2010 at the two most important nesting colonies. There was significant variation among colonies in the number of cavities occupied by Parrots each year. Rainfall significantly influenced both the number of occupied cavities and productivity, which declined after very dry years. Natural unpredictable events such as hurricanes did not modify the nesting activity of Maroon-fronted Parrots at breeding colonies. However, wildfires increased in dry years, negatively affecting attendance at breeding colonies. The Maroon-fronted Parrot may overcome the impacts of climatic variability, natural stochastic processes, and human-induced catastrophic events by using nesting colonies as a network of resources throughout the breeding range. Given the current trends in climate change, it is likely the species may suffer stronger and more frequent unpredictable catastrophic events, potentially putting at risk its survival in the long term. © 2014 British Ornithologists' Union.","Cliff-nesting; ENSO; La Niña; Sierra Madre Oriental; Wildfires","anthropogenic effect; bird; breeding population; breeding site; catastrophic event; cliff; climate change; colony; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; endangered species; hurricane; La Nina; limestone; microhabitat; nesting behavior; population decline; reproductive cycle; reproductive productivity; survival; wildfire; Mexico [North America]; Sierra Madre Oriental; Sierra Madre [Mexico]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84896125484

Although the elements of economic and environmental assessment have been relatively well developed and accepted, the effective inclusion of 'social' aspects in assessments of sustainable development are still being grappled with. This paper, which discusses a project that investigated the sustainable development of the Marine Scalefish Fishery in South Australia, was focused on providing a combined assessment of the interrelationships between the environmental, economic and social aspects of the industry and the effect of its restructure in 2005. The findings highlight the complexities of developing effective policies to address all three aspects of sustainable development, rather than trading off one outcome against another. In the case of the fishery at hand, while the environmental and economic objectives of the adjustment appear to have achieved, the social objectives may well have not. In this circumstance, the findings raise the possibility that the social impacts of the restructure may in fact, alone, compromise the long term future of the industry, despite the economic success of the restructure. This paper addresses the results of the research and presents some salient social issues that policy makers and industry should be aware of, when considering industry structure and futures in a changing economic and climatic environment. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Vampire bats are highly mobile and social, engaging in frequent allogrooming, which is likely to facilitate pathogen spread. Sickness behaviour is known to reduce social associations, but the effect on physical interactions between associated individuals, such as grooming, is less understood. Here, we tested the effects of induced sickness behaviour on allogrooming in vampire bats, while holding association between individuals in groups constant. To experimentally induce sickness behaviour, we used injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and saline controls in 13 female common vampire bats, Desmodus rotundus, housed in stable groups of two to four adult bats. LPS injection induced an immune response that mimicked illness. Circulating leukocytes and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios increased, while body mass and activity decreased. While LPS-injected bats did not receive less grooming from their group mates, they dramatically reduced the amount that they groomed their partners. This reduction in social interactions illustrates that sickness behaviour can potentially change transmission rates by altering directed behaviours, even under conditions of constant close proximity. The ability to manipulate social behaviours under controlled conditions should also prove useful for experiments attempting to test mechanisms underlying cooperation. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","allogrooming; disease transmission; lipopolysaccharide; sickness behaviour; social network; sociality","bat; cell; disease transmission; eusociality; grooming; group behavior; immune response; induced response; parasite transmission; polysaccharide; social behavior; social network; Desmodus rotundus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047412952

Pathogens have evolved strategies to breach structural barriers and avoid or counter preformed and induced chemical defenses of their host plants. Plants have evolved sensitive mechanisms to perceive bioagressors and innate immune responses are activated when plants encounter non-adapted microbes, virulent microbes and insects, or when plants engage in a gene-for-gene resistance response. The earliest events in innate immunity are triggered by the perception of the mechanical and chemical signals associated with injury and highly conserved molecules called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which signal the presence of a nonself organism (i.e., a microbial or animal aggressor). Using mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades, PAMP-triggered immunity integrates with the salicylic acid (SA)-, jasmonic acid (JA)-, and ethylene (ET)-regulated defense pathways. This complex and dynamic network provides effective, inducible defenses to resist pathogens and herbivores. Consistent with the defense arms race of plants and pathogens, these intruders attempt to derail defenses by the strategic deployment of virulence factors or effectors. In this chapter, the similarities and distinctions of the adaptive defense strategies used by pathogens and insect herbivores to recover nutrients and promote their establishment and proliferation on host plants will be emphasized. The role of PAMPs and the distinctive chemical nature of herbivore elicitors and effectors in plant-herbivore interactions are discussed. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

With its long and well documented history of pollution, Lake Orta offers the opportunity to document the post-extirpation recovery of freshwater unionid mussels. This case evidences that recovery/recolonization is possible despite a high devastation in the past, and permits to evaluate how fast recolonization may occur, in which way, and in what conditions. The answer to the how fast was sought by estimating the age of the larger and seemingly older individuals of the population. To address the in which way we compared the haplotypes of Lake Orta specimens of Unio elongatulus (the only species present) with those of surrounding populations. We concluded that, since Lake Orta lacks a direct connection with the putative source populations, colonizing mussels were almost certainly transported by fish carrying glochidia that were used for lake restocking after liming. Data from the long-term monitoring of water chemistry and sediments have allowed defining what conditions proved to be suitable for survival making possible the start of mussels recovery. But not only water and sediment quality matters for mussels recovery, which was delayed by nearly ten years after the reappearance of fish. This delay reflects the need of the whole trophic chain to be reestablished to allow the survival of the suitable and healthy host-fish populations necessary for mussels reproduction. © 2016, Page Press Publications.

However, although many studies have focused on spatial position in flocks of birds and schools of fish, relatively few studies have been conducted in mammals with high accuracy. Because some mammal species form societies, we wondered how social relationships among mammals within a group influence each individual’s spatial position. To address this issue, we used drones to obtain accurate positioning of individuals in a feral horse group on the Serra D’ Arga mountain in Portugal. The results of our study revealed the following characteristics: (1) the male in between social and spatial relationships indicated that they are independent from each other. The present study is the first to reveal the characteristics of spatial positioning in a mammalian group using drone technology. The harem group was located in the periphery; (2) as in other species, individuals had areas of repulsion and attraction, and (3) nearest neighbors were located more toward the sides than to the back or front. We also measured the social relationships between individuals in terms of grooming frequency. Social network analyses of the correlation between social and spatial relationships indicated that they are independent from each other.

Using controlled and replicated experiments, the role of familiarity as a potential mechanism driving aggregation and social behaviour in this species was considered. Observed S. canicula association data compared to null model simulations of random distributions revealed differences in aggregation under different social contexts. Only familiar juvenile S. canicula aggregated more than would be expected from random distribution across their habitat. Familiarity increased the mean number of groups but did not significantly affect mean group size. Significant preference and avoidance behaviour across all groups were also observed. Furthermore, the strength of social attraction, quantified by the mean association index, was significantly higher in groups containing familiar individuals. Mixed familiar and unfamiliar treatments were also conducted to test for within- and between-group effects, finding high variation across replicates with some groups assorting by familiarity and others not. It is believed that this study is the first to examine experimentally the influence of conspecific familiarity on aggregation behaviour in sharks. These results not only imply a functional benefit to aggregation, but also suggest that persistent social affiliation is likely to influence dispersal following hatching in this small benthic elasmobranch. © 2012 The Authors.

Spatial genetic structure (SGS) of freshwater insects is particularly influenced by catchment characteristics and land use in the surroundings of the river. Gene flow also depends on the life cycle of organisms. Aquatic larvae mainly drift downstream whereas flying adults can disperse actively overland and along watercourses. In-stream movements can generate isolation by distance (IBD) at a local scale and differentiation between subcatchments. However, these patterns can be disrupted by overland dispersal. We studied SGS across the Loire River in the damselfly Calopteryx splendens which is able to disperse along and between watercourses. Our sampling design allowed us to test for overland dispersal effects on genetic differentiation between watercourses. Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers revealed high genetic differentiation at the catchment scale but the genetic structure did not reflect the geographical structure of sampling sites. We observed IBD patterns when considering the distance following the watercourse but also the Euclidean distance, i.e. the shortest distance, between pairs of sites. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis of overland dispersal between watercourses. From a conservation perspective, attention should be paid to the actual pathways of gene flow across complex landscapes such as river networks. © 2008 The Authors.","AFLP; Catchment; Isolation by distance; Landscape genetics; Odonates","fresh water; amplified fragment length polymorphism; animal; article; France; gene flow; genetic variability; genetics; geography; insect; parasitology; population genetics; Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis; Animals; France; Fresh Water; Gene Flow; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Geography; Insects; Calopteryx splendens; Hexapoda; Zygoptera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47649104547

The associations among vertebrates, pathogens and their commensal/symbiotic microbial communities (i.e. microbiomes) have important downstream effects for biodiversity conservation, yet we know little about how deforestation contributes to changes in host microbial diversity and pathogen abundance. Here, we tested the effects of landcover, forest connectivity and infection by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) on amphibian skin bacterial diversity along deforestation gradients in Brazilian landscapes. If disturbance to natural habitat alters skin microbiomes as it does in vertebrate host communities, then we would expect higher host bacterial diversity in natural forest habitats. Bd infection loads are also often higher in these closed-canopy forests, which may in turn impact skin-associated bacterial communities. We found that forest corridors shaped composition of host skin microbiomes; high forest connectivity predicted greater similarity of skin bacterial communities among host populations. In addition, we found that host skin bacterial diversity and Bd loads increased towards natural vegetation. Because symbiotic bacteria can potentially buffer hosts from Bd infection, we also evaluated the bi-directional microbiome-Bd link but failed to find a significant effect of skin bacterial diversity reducing Bd infections. Although weak, we found support for Bd increasing bacterial diversity and/or for core bacteria dominance reducing Bd loads. Our research incorporates a critical element in the study of host microbiomes by linking environmental heterogeneity of landscapes to the host-pathogen-microbiome triangle. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

The paper used a structured case study approach to analyse the impacts and responses and relied heavily on existing reports and data sources in each country. The pandemic has further revealed the vulnerability of small-scale fishing households in the region. Given the few assets of fisher households, their ability to cushion the negative impact of crises and shocks is limited. Fishers made adaptive responses such as direct fish marketing, online marketing, and home delivery services. While short-term responses of providing food and financial assistance have been helpful, long-term support to address pandemics such as COVID-19 and other stressors will require developing more resilient fishing households. The paper recommends several approaches and interventions to improve household resilience and to be better prepared for similar challenges and threats in the future. These include: i) strengthening the fishing households’ social network of friends, relatives, and neighbours to serve as both a social safety net and a bridge towards the transition to financial inclusion; ii) diversifying livelihood to reduce dependency on the fishery and provide for additional sources of income and food; iii) promoting financial inclusion through savings, credit, digital payment products, and insurance; iv) value chain upgrading through post-harvest fish handling and processing methods; and, v) providing access, especially for women, to social protection measures such as government health insurance and social security. © Asian Fisheries Society.","Coastal livelihood; Coping; Fishers; Pandemic; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104825330

Management institutions operating at diferent spatial scales create diferent kinds of hierarchies, relationships, and incentives. Hence the scale at which management decisions are made can strongly influence their effectiveness. In the United States, top-down coast-wide control rules can create perverse harvest incentives, impose adverse social impacts, and result in poor conservation and economic performance. Some large-scale institutional changes (e.g., individual fishing quotas) have effectively realigned economic incentives of individual harvesters, but fishermen respond to a diversity of factors in addition to economic incentives, including environmental and social factors that operate primarily in small-scale U.S. fisheries or within subunits of larger-scale fisheries. Failure to address scale issues has resulted in disputes over ""best available science"" and opposition to management perceived as threatening. Small-scale cooperative strategies that empower fishing communities to strengthen local monitoring efforts and social networks are practiced throughout the world, with often impressive success, but have yet to become integrated into mainstream U.S. fisheries management. We assessed potential barriers and bridges to using cooperative strategies to improve sustainability of small-scale U.S. fisheries. We selected California's nearshore fishery to demonstrate the methods, but the analytical framework we present can be applied to many others. Of course, successful implementation will require more than good analysis. People and institutions interested in cooperative strategies must continue to assemble resources and political will to overcome the barriers to progress that exist in the United States. © 2010 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.",,"environmental factor; fishery management; fishing community; harvesting; hierarchical system; human behavior; integrated approach; social impact; sustainability; top-down control; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952216667

Such work is critical for the development of conservation plans that are relevant at the scale of entire ecosystems. The stream network is the foundation upon which stream systems are organized. Natural and human disturbances in streams alter the configuration of stream habitats such as pools, riffles, and glides across seasons, decades, or centuries. Thus, native aquatic species have developed mechanisms for adapting to the dynamic configuration of habitats in stream networks. At different spatial scales, stream network structure informs habitat connectivity for aquatic-obligate species. The movement of aquatic species both upstream and downstream is limited by stream channels and may be modified by the downstream flow of water, nutrients, and physical materials such as wood and substrate. Analysing streams as networks offers a realistic and holistic perspective for assessing movement and distribution by freshwater aquatic species in response to life-history needs and environmental conditions. In this study, network analysis was facilitated by automating, in a Geographic Information System, the calculation of network distances and variables that represent spatial configuration. A comparison between traditional instream habitat variables and network variables for juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in seven sub-basins of Oregon's mid-coast over a 5-year period revealed that network variables perform better at explaining juvenile coho salmon density than instream habitat variables. Moreover, analysis of network distances among seasonal habitats indicates that juvenile coho salmon density may be higher where the distance between critical seasonal habitats is short.

Many of these studies have focused on species exhibiting parental care, which may facilitate the transmission of the social environment from parents to offspring. This becomes problematic when disentangling whether kin-biased associations are driven by kin recognition, or are a product of transmission of the social environment during ontogeny, or a combination of both. Studying kin-biased associations in systems that lack parental care may aid in addressing this issue. Furthermore, when studying kin-biased social associations, it is important to differentiate whether these originate from preferential choice or occur randomly as a result of habitat use or limited dispersal. Here, we combined high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism data with a long-term behavioral data set of a reptile with no parental care to demonstrate that eastern water dragons (Intellagama lesueurii) bias their nonrandom social associations toward their kin. In particular, we found that although the overall social network was not linked to genetic relatedness, individuals associated with kin more than expected given availability in space and also biased social preferences toward kin. This result opens important opportunities for the study of kinship-driven associations without the confounding effect of vertical transmission of social environments. Furthermore, we present a robust multiple-step approach for determining whether kin-biased social associations are a result of active social decisions or random encounters resulting from habitat use and dispersal patterns. © 2019 The Author(s).

We conducted a field experiment on coral reef fishes in Moorea, French Polynesia, to quantify how differing levels of habitat availability (controlling for quality) increased and/or redirected colonizing larval fish. Focal reefs without neighboring reefs received two to four times more settlers than reefs with adjacent habitat, demonstrating that increased habitat redirected larval fish. At the scale of the entire reef array, total colonization increased 1.3-fold in response to a sixfold increase in reef area (and a 2.75-fold increase in adjusted habitat availability). Thus, propagules were both increased and redirected, a result midway between the Field-of-Dreams and Propagule Redirection Hypotheses. A recruitment model using our data and field estimates of density-dependent recruitment predicts that habitat addition increases recruitment primarily by ameliorating the negative effects of competition at existing sites rather than increasing colonization at the new sites per se. Understanding long-term implications of these effects depends upon the interplay among habitat dynamics, population connectivity, colonization dynamics, and density dependence. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Attraction-production; Coral reefs; Density dependence; Habitat selection; Reef fish; Settlement; Settlement shadow","colonization; density dependence; fish; habitat availability; habitat selection; larval settlement; propagule; recruitment (population dynamics); reef; animal; article; ecosystem; fish; Pacific Ocean; physiology; population dynamics; reproduction; species difference; Animals; Ecosystem; Fishes; Pacific Ocean; Population Dynamics; Reproduction; Species Specificity; Moorea; Society Islands; Windward Islands [Society Islands]; Anthozoa; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77957727059

As fishes grow in body size, they can consume larger-bodied prey items at potentiallyhigher trophic levels. Therefore, body size should predict trophic position. Trophic position (TP) is useful for describing energy flow between biota, giving a more comprehensive picture of aquatic food webs, but the factors that influence the body-size–TP relationship are unclear. Additionally, stable isotope-derived TP and body-size relationships are untested for temperate freshwater fishes. Using linear mixed-effects models, we tested fish body mass as a predictor of TP across 6 species of temperate freshwater fish (n 5 921 total individuals) sampled from 110 stream reaches in New Zealand, and we evaluated habitat factors (flood disturbance and stream size) likely to affect trophic structure of stream fish assemblages. Supporting ecological theory, but contrasting with some previous findings in marine and tropical environments, we found that TP was positively associated with body size across all species. Habitat factors did not affect fish TP. However, stream network spatial factors included in models as random effects explained the majority of variance in TP across species. Thus, while our study shows that New Zealand temperate freshwater fish body size is positively associated with stable isotope-derived TP, researchers will need to account for catchment-specific spatial factors to make accurate inferences about TP based on body size. © 2020 by The Society for Freshwater Science.","Conservation; Fish assemblages; Food webs; Non-native species; Rivers; Stable isotope analysis; Trophic ecology","bioenergetics; body mass; body size; energy flow; freshwater ecosystem; isotopic composition; prediction; prey availability; stream channel; trophic interaction; tropical region; New Zealand; Animalia; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090251312

Human activities such as urbanization can alter animal movement behavior, including site fidelity and resource use. Because many urban areas are adjacent to natural sites, mobile animals might connect natural and urban habitats. More generally, understanding animal movement patterns in urban areas can help predict how urban expansion will affect the roles of highly mobile animals in ecological processes. Methods: Here, we examined movements by a seasonally nomadic wading bird, the American white ibis (Eudocimus albus), in South Florida, USA. White ibis are colonial wading birds that forage on aquatic prey; in recent years, some ibis have shifted their behavior to forage in urban parks, where they are fed by people. We used a spatial network approach to investigate how individual movement patterns influence connectivity between urban and non-urban sites. We built a network of habitat connectivity using GPS tracking data from ibis during their non-breeding season and compared this network to simulated networks that assumed individuals moved indiscriminately with respect to habitat type. Results: We found that the observed network was less connected than the simulated networks, that urban-urban and natural-natural connections were strong, and that individuals using urban sites had the least-variable habitat use. Importantly, the few ibis that used both urban and natural habitats contributed the most to connectivity. Conclusions: Habitat specialization in urban-acclimated wildlife could reduce the exchange of propagules and nutrients between urban and natural areas, which has consequences both for beneficial effects of connectivity such as gene flow and for detrimental effects such as the spread of contaminants or pathogens. © 2020, The Author(s).","American white ibis (Eudocimus albus); Connectivity; Habitat specialization; Network; Nomadism; Urbanization; Wildlife",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097239195

Group size may also influence social stability, but no information is available about its influence on social bonding. We investigated the effect of group size and social motivation on the strength of social bonds between familiar Japanese quail chicks. The behaviour of quail selected for high (HSR) or low (LSR) social reinstatement behaviour and housed in different group sizes (6, 15 and 30 individuals) was recorded during two successive 10 min situations: separation and return of a cagemate or an unfamiliar conspecific. In both lines and for all group sizes, chicks formed social bonds with cagemates, shown by disturbance at separation and a greater calming effect of the return of a familiar versus an unfamiliar quail. LSR chicks might form stronger social bonds than HSR ones but our results do not allow us to conclude confidently on that point. With increasing group size, the calming effect and especially the positive social interactions decreased in both lines, indicating a weakening of the social bond between familiar conspecifics, perhaps because of the larger number of potential partners or the establishment of a tolerant social strategy based on less aggression, less time spent in contact and weaker bonds. Further investigations of the relationship between group size and social bonding in this species may allow us to determine why their social behaviour changes with increasing group size and to make more suitable social environments for domestic birds. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.","Affinity; Bird; Chick; Coturnix japonica; Genetic selection; Japanese quail; Social bonding; Social environment; Social relationship","aggression; conspecific; gamebird; group size; social network; Aves; Coturnix; Coturnix japonica; Phasianidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79851512445

Social network analyses were used to describe patterns of contact among poultry enterprises and their associates for these four movement types. The response rate to the survey was 58% (244 out of 420). Network structures for enterprise-to-enterprise movements of feed, live birds and hatching eggs, and table egg and poultry product were characterised by 'hub and spoke' type structures with small-world characteristics. Small worlds were created by network hubs (e.g. feed suppliers and hatcheries) providing goods and services to larger numbers of client farms. In addition to hubs acting as the predominant source of material moving onto farms we identified enterprises acting as bridges between identified small worlds. The presence of these bridges is a concern, since their presence has the potential to facilitate the spread of hazards (e.g. feed contaminants, infectious agents carried within feed) more readily throughout the population. An ability to predict enterprises with these network characteristics on the basis of factors such as shed capacity, enterprise type, geographic location would be useful for developing risk-based approaches to disease prevention, surveillance, detection, response and control activities. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Disease; Epidemiology; Network analysis; New Zealand; Poultry","animal; animal food; animal husbandry; article; bird disease; commercial phenomena; community care; disease transmission; female; food; human; male; manure; methodology; New Zealand; poultry; questionnaire; waste management; analysis; animal food; food; manure; New Zealand; Poultry Diseases; procedures; transmission; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Commerce; Community Networks; Female; Humans; Male; Manure; New Zealand; Poultry; Poultry Diseases; Poultry Products; Questionnaires; Waste Management; Aves; manure; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Commerce; Community Networks; Female; Humans; Male; Manure; New Zealand; Poultry; Poultry Diseases; Poultry Products; Questionnaires; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954865085

Although spatial distribution patterns and fish time series of abundance have been studied in the past, little research has addressed the impact of spatial scale on mapping spatiotemporal patterns. To achieve this goal, the first step is to develop a method describing spatiotemporal communities statistically. At three spatial resolutions, from 1043 km2 to 522 km2, we compared the output of a new framework, the Autoregressive Spatiotemporal Clustering analysis (ASTEC) and we finally retained the most parsimonious scale: 522 km2. ASTEC combines a zero-inflated Poisson model with latent predictors alongside a hierarchical clustering analysis using multiscale bootstrap resampling. It estimates the spatial and spatiotemporal communities formed by 16 species in the Eastern English Channel using 20 years of data from the Channel Ground Fishery Survey. Community structure was strongly dependent upon the spatial scale of analysis and the smallest scale provided the most parsimonious model. Moreover, integrating temporality in spatial studies defined a stable composition and richness community structure. Combining a spatial and spatiotemporal approaches highlighted cluster composition shifts over time. It shows that small-scale data should be used for studies on spatial connectivity and meta-community when integrating temporality. Moreover, the scale of the study did not matter anymore in a spatiotemporal case. A combined spatial and spatiotemporal approach defines community dynamics, and may help management and conservation efforts facing climate change and anthropogenic pressures. © SFI","Distribution; Marine communities; Spatial scale; Spatiotemporal model; Species cluster",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093872407

Extension of networks to spatial ecology is currently limited, yet the approach has significant potential as a framework for analysing habitat connectivity and ecosystem stability. Examination of network structures characterizing the spatial dynamics of organisms has the potential to highlight the relative robustness or vulnerability of the ecosystem processes they support. On coral reefs, grazing by large herbivorous fishes is critical in maintaining the balance between coral and algae and is widely recognized as a key process in reef ecosystem functioning. However, the spatial dynamics exhibited by roving herbivores, and the implications of these dynamics for the overall stability and resilience of herbivory on reefs are not well understood. Here, we present a novel extension of network theory to the analysis of movements of marine herbivorous fishes within a reef system. Using an array of remote acoustic receivers, over a period of 12 months, we tracked the movements of fishes belonging to the three dominant species of roving herbivore within a particular coral reef community. Analysing these movements in terms of network graph theory, we found that individual fishes clustered their activities within small sections of the available linear reef habitat, and movements within and outside of these home ranges were made along predictable routes. All three species were heavily reliant on particular, well-connected parts of the reef (nodes), mirroring an 'ultra-small-world' network. This underlying dynamic creates vulnerability in the system, making targeted removal by fishing or the degradation of individual pockets of reef habitat more likely to result in a complete collapse in the overall process of herbivory at that particular area of reef. Our results highlight an inherent vulnerability in the movement dynamics of herbivorous fishes and, by extension, in the overall process of herbivory in reef ecosystems. They suggest that maintaining high herbivore abundances across all reef habitats is critical in preserving the integrity of the grazing function on reefs. The approach of using network graph theory to analyse acoustic telemetry data is illuminating and is likely to have a range of applications across diverse ecosystems. © 2013 British Ecological Society.","Acoustic telemetry; Coral reef resilience; Ecosystem function; Parrotfishes; Rabbitfishes; Roving herbivores; Small-world networks; Spatial ecology","alga; biotelemetry; coral reef; ecosystem function; ecosystem resilience; herbivory; marine ecosystem; movement; network analysis; perciform; vulnerability; algae; Anthozoa; Pisces; Scaridae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900564225

However, efforts to do so considering the joint effects of habitat fragmentation and climate change are still scant. Here, we aimed to outline a framework that incorporates spatial, temporal and multi-taxa criteria to pinpoint locations that connect protected areas in the eastern Amazon. We analyzed three mosaics of protected areas, and data on 603 species (bees, birds, bats) and developed two models using species movement flow (MF; through circuit theory) and habitat suitability (HS; through species distribution models). Considering only the MF, northward areas are the main candidates for corridors, most of which presenting forest cover (68% of the 928,379 ha). This result changes when we analyze the HS, since the corridors are mostly positioned in a different direction (westward) and less than half have forest cover (45% of the 925,058 ha). Candidate areas for both approaches totaled 135,171 ha, with 86% still covered by forest. Our results rely on methodological and taxonomic redundancy (to depict a range of movement and/or habitat requirements) for an efficient strategy to prioritize areas for connectivity. Dynamic restoration simulations showed that the location and order of restoration are important to ensure increased availability of habitat. Our approach can help address two important biodiversity threats (habitat loss and climate change) and maximize the selection of the best corridors to protect species in a rapidly changing world. © 2021 The Author(s)","Circuit theory; Forest management; Habitat connectivity; Habitat suitability; National Forest of Carajás; Protected areas","biodiversity; climate change; connectivity; conservation status; ecological modeling; forest cover; habitat availability; habitat fragmentation; protected area; restoration ecology; spatiotemporal analysis; Amazonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105070216

The resulting social structure then determines how individuals interact with their surroundings—resources and risks, pathogens and predators, competitors and cooperators. However, despite intensive research on (a) how individuals make social decisions and (b) how social structure shapes social processes (e.g. cooperation, competition and conflict), there are still few studies linking these two perspectives. These perspectives represent two halves of a feedback loop: individual behaviour scales up to define the social environment, and this environment, in turn, feeds back by shaping the selective agents that drive individual behaviour. We first review well-established research areas that have captured both elements of this feedback loop—host–pathogen dynamics and cultural transmission. We then highlight areas where social structure is well studied but the two perspectives remain largely disconnected. Finally, we synthesise existing research on 14 distinct research topics to identify new prospects where the interplay between social structure and social processes are likely to be important but remain largely unexplored. Our review shows that the inherent links between individuals’ traits, their social decisions, social structure and social evolution, warrant more consideration. By mapping the existing and missing connections among many research areas, our review highlights where explicitly considering social structure and the individual-to-society feedbacks can reveal new dimensions to old questions in ecology and evolution. © 2020 The Authors.

Yet fish seed systems have received considerably little attention in the diffusion process for genetically improved strains. This study examined how seed systems of genetically improved fish strains function, assessed constraints faced, and explored entry-points to increased diffusion. To address these objectives, the study combined the seed systems performance assessment framework with innovation systems thinking. Data came from participatory multi-stakeholder workshops and interviews with tilapia hatchery operators and grow-out farmers in Bangladesh. We found that tilapia seed production and dissemination was profitable and cost-effective indicating a business case for supply chain actors. However, there were several binding constraints including low adoption of elite broodstock, vulnerability to weather shocks and diseases, poor quality of complementary inputs, intermittent electricity supply, hidden costs of seed transportation, and limited market access. These constraints and their causes interacted, creating systemic lock-ins through blocking mechanisms related to incomplete enforcement of regulatory frameworks to control hatchery practices and quality of inputs; limited knowledge about broodstock management, quality seed production, and disease management; weak adaptive capacity to weather shocks; and limited access to credit. Projects, programs, and policies targeted at accelerating adoption of good quality fish seed should focus on the following important aspects. First, strengthening institutional capacity to monitor and enforce quality control. Second, increasing advocacy and knowledge transfer about benefits and sources of elite broodstock. Third, promoting adoption of better management practices by hatcheries and farmers including adaptation to weather shocks. Fourth, leveraging partnerships with local service providers as intermediaries. Fifth, using social networks for information diffusion among farmers. © 2020 The Author(s)","Aquatic food systems; Bangladesh; Genetically improved farmed fish; Scaling; Seed quality; Seed system","brood stock; electricity supply; hatchery; livelihood; nutrition; performance assessment; questionnaire survey; seed production; stakeholder; vulnerability; Bangladesh; Tilapia; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098583752

Software applications on these devices have become diverse in their functionality and easy to use. Citizen science projects that try to mobilise data collection from people from diverse backgrounds are ideally placed to benefit from the acceptance of easy-to-use technology. This article describes the development of the mobile BirdLasser app and its integrated gamification network, with emphasis on how its unique features contributed to increased participation and submission of data to the current Southern African Bird Atlas Project (SABAP2) and associated BirdMap projects across Africa. The app has experienced a high adoption rate by contributors to SABAP2 (atlassers), birdwatchers and conservationists, contributing to causes, creating life lists and taking part in events. The app has been associated with the recruitment of new participants, but this has also seen a change in atlassing patterns, suggesting caution when using traditional measures of abundance comparisons, especially reporting rate, before and after the adoption of BirdLasser as the data submission pathway. We show that a well-designed mobile app that facilitates the flow of information from observers to databases is essential for maintaining long-term citizen science based, monitoring projects, especially if the platform is fun, well-supported, and free to use; but the introduction of an app may also introduce subtle changes to the data itself and so data submission pathways to citizen science projects is a field that requires additional research. © Zoological Society of Southern Africa.","application; atlasing; birdmapping; data; ornithology; SABAP software","bird; information and communication technology; local participation; research work; social network; software; technology adoption; wildlife management; Southern Africa; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087752705

These diseases may represent a structurally normal biologic network that has become trapped within the basin of an abnormal attractor. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used the Hopfield net as the archetypical example of a dynamic biological network. By progressively removing the links of fully connected Hopfield nets, we found that a designated attractor of the nets could still be supported until only slightly more than 1 link per node remained. As the number of links approached this minimum value, the rate of convergence to this attractor from an arbitrary starting state increased dramatically. Furthermore, with more than about twice the minimum of links, the net became increasingly able to support a second attractor. Conclusions/Significance: We speculate that homeostatic biological networks may have evolved to assume a degree of connectivity that balances robustness and agility against the dangers of becoming trapped in an abnormal attractor. © 2010 Anafi, Bates.",,"algorithm; article; biological model; equilibrium constant; mathematical computing; mathematical model; process development; systems biology; artificial neural network; computer program; computer simulation; genetic disorder; homeostasis; human; kinetics; metabolism; nonlinear system; statistical model; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Homeostasis; Humans; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Neural Networks (Computer); Nonlinear Dynamics; Software; Systems Biology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650979028

Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors are already known from applications in military, private and commercial environments, and their application in animal science is increasing. However, as trade-offs between sensor cost, battery life and sensor weight have to be made, GPS based studies scheduling long data collection periods and including a high number of animals, have to deal with problems like high hardware costs and data disruption during recharging of sensors. Furthermore, human–animal interaction due to sensor changing at the end of battery life interferes with the animal behaviour under analysis. The present study thus proposes a setting to deal with these challenges and offers the software tool ‘HerdGPS-Preprocessor’, because collecting position data from multiple animals nonstop for several weeks produces a high amount of raw data which needs to be sorted, preprocessed and provided in a suitable format per animal and day. The software tool ‘HerdGPS-Preprocessor’ additionally outputs contact lists to enable a straight analysis of animal contacts. The software tool was exemplarily deployed for one month of daily and continuous GPS data of 40 horses in a loose-housing boarding facility in northern Germany. Contact lists were used to generate separate networks for every hour, which are then analysed with regard to the network parameter density, diameter and clique structure. Differences depending on the day and the day time could be observed. More dense networks with more and larger cliques were determined in the hours prior to the opening of additional pasture. © 2020 by the authors.

From this position, they have the potential to have a powerful influence on group dynamics and performance. Here, we use metrics from social network theory to identify Key individuals in groups of 3-4 zebrafish (Danio rerio), and to measure the impact of removing those individuals from the group. We compared the results for two genetically distinct strains of zebrafish and found that although their social dynamics were superficially similar, one strain (Scientific Hatcheries, SH) responded to social perturbation, whereas the other (Parganas North, PN) did not. For both strains, groups that retained their Key fish performed better on a simple group foraging-learning task than did those from which the Key fish had been removed. However, the SH strain learned the task more quickly than did the PN strain, perhaps in part because of sex differences in task performance or because of strain differences in the reaction to experimental disturbance. We also confirm the utility of measures of social dynamics and social role that can be estimated reliably from very short observation sessions and by relatively untrained observers. These results set the stage for future research into the genetic mechanisms underlying social roles and group learning in vertebrates. © 2011 American Psychological Association.","Gatekeeper; Group performance; Information Centrality; Zebrafish","animal; animal behavior; article; comparative study; cooperation; crowding; exploratory behavior; female; learning; male; social dominance; species difference; zebra fish; Animals; Association Learning; Behavior, Animal; Cooperative Behavior; Exploratory Behavior; Female; Hierarchy, Social; Male; Mass Behavior; Social Dominance; Species Specificity; Zebrafish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051991311

We used an age-structured model of different primate social systems to illustrate that interactions between social structure and demography create 'dynamic constraints' on the pathogens that can establish and persist in primate host species with different social systems. We showed that this varies by disease transmission mode. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) require high rates of transmissibility to persist within a primate population. In particular, for a unimale social system, STIs require extremely high rates of transmissibility for persistence, and remain at extremely low prevalence in small primates, but this is less constrained in longer-lived, larger-bodied primates. In contrast, aerosol transmitted infections (ATIs) spread and persist at high prevalence in medium and large primates with moderate transmissibility;, establishment and persistence in small-bodied primates require higher relative rates of transmissibility. Intragroup contact structure - the social network - creates different constraints for different transmission modes, and our model underscores the importance of intragroup contacts on infection prior to intergroup movement in a structured population. When alpha males dominate sexual encounters, the resulting disease transmission dynamics differ from when social interactions are dominated by mother-infant grooming events, for example. This has important repercussions for pathogen spread across populations. Our framework reveals essential social and demographic characteristics of primates that predispose them to different disease risks that will be important for disease management and conservation planning for protected primate populations. © 2013 Ryan et al.",,"adult; aerosol; alpha animal; article; body size; demography; disease simulation; disease transmission; dominance behavior; female; grooming; human; infant; male; mother child relation; nonhuman; pathogenicity; population dynamics; population structure; prevalence; primate disease; sexual behavior; sexually transmitted disease; small mammal; social interaction; social structure; species conservation; Algorithms; Animals; Computer Simulation; Female; Grooming; Male; Models, Biological; Prevalence; Primate Diseases; Primates; Reproduction; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84885828864

Because of its contiguous distribution and extended breeding season this species might be expected to show a phylogeographic pattern of isolation by distance rather than divergent geographical lineages. To investigate population structure and make inferences about physical processes that have influenced gene flow in this species, two mitochondrial genes (ND2 and 16S) were sequenced for 64 frogs from across the distribution of the species. Phylogenetic analyses (parsimony and Bayesian) revealed two well-supported clades partitioning the range of this taxon, with one clade restricted to the northeast (summer rainfall) and the other restricted to the south (winter and aseasonal rainfall). The magnitude of sequence divergence between these clades is higher than expected, and is typical of levels of sequence divergence found among closely related species of pyxicephalid frogs. Phylogeographic analyses of sequence networks and spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) revealed additional geographical structure within each of these lineages.

Measuring how they are trophically linked, both directly and indirectly, to other species is vital to comprehend the mechanisms driving alterations in fish communities in space and time. Moreover, this knowledge also helps to understand how fish communities respond to environmental change and delivers important information for implementing management of fish stocks. DNA-based methods have significantly widened our ability to assess trophic interactions in both marine and freshwater systems and they possess a range of advantages over other approaches in diet analysis. In this review we provide an overview of different DNA-based methods that have been used to assess trophic interactions of fish as consumers and prey. We consider the practicalities and limitations, and emphasize critical aspects when analysing molecular derived trophic data. We exemplify how molecular techniques have been employed to unravel food web interactions involving fish as consumers and prey.

In this study, records of non-native and Japanese Red List fishes observed by citizens were extracted from all 85,453 posts on the bulletin board system of WEB sakana-zukan, a web-based encyclopedia of Japanese fishes that went online in 2002. We found 681 (0.8%) and 549 (0.6%) posts containing attached images of non-native and Red Data Book fishes, resulting in 418 and 362 Japanese distributional records respectively. The number of posts and the composition of non-native species reflected the Japanese inland fisheries policy to increase target species. These data included records of exotic species (eleven taxa) whose introduction to Japan had been unknown previously, as well as records of nine exotic/domestic species whose introductions into specific Japanese regions had been unknown. Additionally, we identified the range extension of one Red Data Book species. These photographs were stored in a public museum’s photographic collection for ongoing scientific use. Three heavy users of the website combined contributed 26.7% of the new distribution records (8/30 lots), while 15 light users contributed 50.0% (15/30 lots), suggesting that overall there is a greater contribution by light users. This indicates that a web community with abundant users can accumulate new biodiversity observations better than one with fewer users but many posts per user. Our results show that this web-community was able to contribute to monitoring non-native and Red List fishes in conjunction with expert participation, and therefore that web-communities targeting living organisms can contribute to biodiversity conservation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Citizen science; Database; Picture; Social networking service (SNS); Verifiability; Voucher","biodiversity; community structure; database; fish; geographical distribution; Internet; introduced species; local participation; participatory approach; photograph; range expansion; Red List; social network; Japan; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076095851

One of the main consequences of a reduction in water pH for aquatic organisms is the disruption of their chemosensory abilities, as the detection of chemical cues underpins a wide range of decision-making processes; for example, a reduction to low pH has been shown to interfere with predator avoidance and the detection of foraging cues. Moreover, aquatic organisms are known to make widespread use of chemical information to inform their social behaviour, although we have a comparably poor understanding of how this is impacted by water acidification, especially their shoaling behaviour. Using a standard behavioural assay, we therefore investigated the impact of low water pH on the social interactions mediated by diet-derived chemical cues in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), by quantifying social behaviour in water that varied either experimentally or naturally in pH. In both cases, we predicted that association patterns would be disrupted by low pH conditions, as reduced pH has shown to interfere with the perception of chemical cues in other non-social contexts. Consistent with this prediction, our results demonstrate that an acute, short-term reduction in water pH caused a breakdown in the diet-mediated social interaction patterns seen in more alkaline water, although, interestingly, the pattern of associations for fish tested in naturally acidic water was both more complex and in a direction that was precisely contrary to our predictions. Overall, the findings provide insights into the potential effects of an acute reduction in water pH on fish communication and social interaction patterns, which may have implication for various individual, group, population and community-level processes. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH","anthropogenic interference; chemical cues; Gasterosteus aculeatus; social network; sticklebacks; water acidity","acidification; acidity; alkaline water; anthropogenic effect; aquatic organism; avoidance reaction; chemical cue; fish; pH; preference behavior; social behavior; social network; Gasterosteus aculeatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061574055

In Portugal, the construction of several big dams all through the 20th century was a major cause of disappearance or decline of long distance migratory fish species from various rivers. In this study we analysed the historical changes of functional connectivity for diadromous fish at the Tagus basin river network (Portugal), using a spatial graph approach that integrates both structural connectivity and habitat suitability. Due to the presence of many artificial barriers, the current distribution of species does not reflect natural environmental conditions. Therefore, historical data on the occurrence of species is paramount to assess the potential habitat suitability. The compilation of historical data on the distribution of diadromous species [Sea Lamprey—Petromyzon marinus (Linnaeus 1758) and Allis shad—Alosa alosa (Linnaeus 1758)] was based on geographical dictionaries and geo-referenced information for Portugal dated between 1700 and 1900. Habitat suitability was expressed as the probabilities of occurrence of empirical predictive models based on the historical records and a set of regionalized environmental data. The loss of connectivity caused by big dam construction between 1928 and 2004 was then analysed using a spatial graph approach. The output of this analysis will aid decision-makers to optimize targets of connectivity restoration actions aiming at enhancing the functional connectivity of the river network for diadromous species, using the historical situation as a benchmark. © 2014, Springer Basel.","Allis shad; Longitudinal connectivity; Sea lamprey; Spatial graph; Species distribution modeling; Tagus river","connectivity; dam construction; decision making; diadromy; fish; habitat conservation; habitat type; historical ecology; historical record; human activity; network analysis; river evolution; river flow; spatial analysis; twentieth century; Portugal; Tagus River; Alosa alosa; Petromyzon marinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84937977537

We also test whether settlement of the region between ∼39–24,000 cal BP relates to environmental variability. The earliest evidence occurs in archaeological horizon (AH) VII from ∼39–36,000 cal BP during a mild, moist climatic phase. AH VI shows periodic occupation as warm, humid conditions prevailed from ∼36–32,000 cal BP. As the climate becomes cooler and drier at ∼32–29,000 cal BP (AH V-IV), evidence for occupation is minimal. However, as cooling continues, the deposits of AH III demonstrate that people used the site more intensively from ∼29–24,000 cal BP, leaving behind numerous stone artifacts, faunal remains, and complex combustion features. Despite the climatic fluctuations seen across this 15,000-year sequence, lithic technology remains attuned to one pattern: unidirectional reduction of small cores geared towards the production of bladelets for tool manufacture. Subsistence patterns also remain stable, focused on medium-sized prey such as ovids and caprids, as well as equids. AH III demonstrates an expansion of social networks to the northwest and southwest, as the transport distance of obsidian used to make stone artifacts increases. We also observe the addition of bone tools, including an eyed needle, and shell beads brought from the east, suggesting that these people manufactured complex clothing and wore ornaments. Remains of micromammals, birds, charcoal, pollen, and tephra relate the story of environmental variability. We hypothesize that UP behavior was linked to shifts in demographic pressures and climatic changes. Thus, by combining archaeological and environmental data, we gain a clearer picture about the first UP inhabitants of the Armenian Highlands. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Armenia; Bone tools; Lithic technology; Obsidian sourcing; Paleoclimate; Upper Paleolithic","archaeology; bone; cave system; human settlement; lithic fragment; obsidian; paleoclimate; Paleolithic; tool use; upland region; Armenia [West Asia]; Aves; Equidae; archeology; Armenia; cave; human; Archaeology; Armenia; Caves; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022063784

Young nurses are typically found deep within the nest where they tend to the queen and the brood, whereas older foragers are found near the entrance and outside the nest.1-3 However, the individual-level maturation dynamics remain poorly understood because following individuals over relevant timescales is difficult; hence, previous experimental studies used same-age cohort designs.4-15 To address this, we used an automated tracking system to follow >500 individuals over >100 days and constructed networks of physical contacts to provide a continuous measure of worker social maturity. These analyses revealed that most workers occupied one of two steady states, namely a low-maturity nurse state and a high-maturity forager state, with the remaining workers rapidly transitioning between these states. There was considerable variation in the age at transition, and, surprisingly, the transition probability was age independent. This suggests that the transition is largely stochastic rather than a hard-wired age-dependent physiological change. Despite the variation in timing, the transition dynamics were highly stereotyped. Transitioning workers moved from the nurse to the forager state according to an S-shaped trajectory, and only began foraging after completing the transition. Stochastic switching, which occurs in many other biological systems, may provide ant colonies with robustness to extrinsic perturbations by allowing the colony to decouple its division of labor from its demography.

Levins's loop analysis was used as a methodological framework for assessing the local stability (considered as a component of sustainability) of the modeled management interventions represented by various scenarios. The results provided by models of different complexity (models 1 through 4) showed that a reduction of coral species cover would drive the system to unstable states. In the absence of the alien lionfish, the simultaneous fishing of large benthic epifaunal species, adult herbivorous fish and adult carnivorous fish could be sustainable only if the coral species present high levels of cover (models 2 and 3). Once the lionfish is added to the simulations (models 4 and 5), the analysis suggests that although the exploitation or removal of lionfish from shallow waters may be locally stable, it remains necessary to implement additional and concurrent human interventions that increase the holistic sustainability of the control strategy. The supplementary interventions would require the implementation of programs for: (1) the restoration of corals for increasing their cover, (2) the exploitation or removal of lionfish from deeper waters (decreasing the chance of source/sink meta-population dynamics) and (3) the implementation of bans and re-stocking programs for carnivorous fishes (such as grouper) that increase the predation and competition pressure on lionfish (i.e. biological control).

One of the most promising candidates for such a signaling system is the cooperatively breeding bell miner, Manorina melanophrys. Large numbers of unrelated helpers attend multiple nests while giving individually identifiable vocalizations, breeding females usually remain within monitoring distance of the nest area, and females often re-pair with the hardest working male helper after the death/removal of their breeding partner. We examined the possibility that helping operates as a signal by temporarily removing the potential audience: the breeding male or the breeding female. However, there was no discernable change in provisioning behavior of helpers, relative to control periods. We also simulated the presence of the removed birds through playbacks of their individual-specific calls and again found no effect on others' visit rates, prey types, load size, and a variety of other behaviors at the nest. If either signaling hypothesis explained helping in this system, we might have expected facultative decreases in conspicuous provisioning behaviors when one or other potential audience was absent. Thus, despite possessing many of the prerequisites of a signal-based helping system, there is no evidence for such a phenomenon in bell miners. Cooperation in these groups of mixed relatedness may instead be driven by a combination of kin selection and direct benefits via group augmentation and/or pseudoreciprocity. © The Author 2008.

However, the social organization of these groups also offers the potential to provide an effective barrier against the transmission of pathogens within the colony. Social insects with their elaborate colony organizations provide an ideal model system to develop and test this hypothesis. While the different elements of colony organization are generally assumed to be products of ergonomic selection, in this paper we address how the same elements could influence the transmission of pathogens. By developing a simple model, we explore how three parameters of colony organization, division of labor, interaction network and colony demography could influence the transmission of pathogens. We find that heterogeneity among individuals in terms of division of labor alone has little effect on the spread of an infection in the colony and the scenario is indistinguishable from one in which all the individuals are homogeneous. However, division of labor, combined with heterogeneity in the interaction network and demographic schedules reduce the spread of an infection. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, persistent technological and logistical challenges have thus far impeded the implementation of biotelemetry in the deep sea. Despite these limitations, innovations in telemetry technology, experimental design, and animal handling have allowed the study of 13 families of deep-water fishes to date, providing movement records spanning from surface waters down to 5900 m depth and across nearly all of the world's oceans. Telemetry devices employed in deep-sea tracking studies have included both commercially available and custom-built transmitters belonging to multiple tag categories: acoustic transponders/code-activated acoustic transponders, acoustic transmitters (coded and continuous, e.g., ‘pingers’), pop-up satellite archival tags, and archival tags (data loggers). Specially adapted tagging approaches, including in situ methods such as dart tagging via manned submersible, underwater surgical implantation, and the ingestion of baited transmitters have facilitated the monitoring of species that can not survive being brought to the surface, while modified capture, tag, and release approaches have been used for species that can withstand depressurization. These tracking data have revealed patterns in the vertical and horizontal movement behaviours and population connectivity of a number of data deficient species, as well as contributing to management by allowing the effectiveness of reserves, fisheries management boundaries, and fishery closures to be evaluated. With the rapid expansion of fisheries and natural resource exploration to depths beyond the continental shelf, further monitoring of deep-sea habitats and species is essential. By examining these substantial breakthroughs in biotelemetry application, in addition to the range of cutting-edge technologies that could be adapted for use in deep water, we strive to promote the timely advancement of this research in the deep sea. Further diversification of these tools and techniques will be necessary to expand the accessibility of this field to the broader scientific community. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Animal tracking; Deep-water; Movement ecology; Spatial ecology; Telemetry","Animals; Biotelemetry; Ecology; Fisheries; Natural resources exploration; Population statistics; Telemetering; Telemetering equipment; Transmitters; Transponders; Acoustic transmitters; Acoustic transponders; Animal tracking; Biotelemetry applications; Cutting edge technology; Deep Water; Movement ecologies; Spatial ecology; Bioacoustics; biotelemetry; continental shelf; deep water; deep-sea organism; equipment; exploration; fishery management; instrumentation; movement; natural resource; tracking; Animalia; Pisces",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062659789

The food material was classified as arthropod or plant in origin. The arthropod particles were identified to orders. Fire ant foragers carried more arthropods than plant material. Coleoptera and Homoptera were the most abundant groups preyed upon. These insect orders contain various economically important pests of sweetpotato. Other major hexapod groups included the orders Hemiptera, Diptera and Collembola. The quantity of foraged material varied over the season.

Sociality implies preserving relationships between group members. An increase in group size and/or in competition for food within the group can result in decrease certain social interactions between members, and the group may split irreversibly as a consequence. One individual may try to maintain bonds with a maximum of group members in order to keep group cohesion, i.e. proximity and stable relationships. However, this strategy needs time and time is often limited. In addition, previous studies have shown that whatever the group size, an individual interacts only with certain grooming partners. There, we develop a computational model to assess how dynamics of group cohesion are related to group size and to the structure of grooming relationships. Groups' sizes after simulated fission are compared to observed sizes of 40 groups of primates. Results showed that the relationship between grooming time and group size is dependent on how each individual attributes grooming time to its social partners, i.e. grooming a few number of preferred partners or grooming equally or not all partners. The number of partners seemed to be more important for the group cohesion than the grooming time itself. This structural constraint has important consequences on group sociality, as it gives the possibility of competition for grooming partners, attraction for high-ranking individuals as found in primates' groups. It could, however, also have implications when considering the cognitive capacities of primates. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Cohesion; ODD protocol; Population structure; Social network; Time allocation","cognition; grooming; group behavior; group size; modeling; population structure; primate; social network; time allocation; article; controlled study; grooming; group dynamics; group structure; interspecific competition; population structure; primate; priority journal; social interaction; social structure; Animals; Competitive Behavior; Computer Simulation; Grooming; Group Structure; Models, Biological; Primates; Social Behavior; Social Environment; Time Factors; Animalia; Primates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651365070

A Cytoscape plugin named NetDS was recently proposed to analyze the robustness-related dynamics and feed-forward/feedback loop structures of biological networks. Despite such a useful function, limitations on the network size that can be analyzed exist due to high computational costs. In addition, the plugin cannot verify an intrinsic property which can be induced by an observed result because it has no function to simulate the observation on a large number of random networks. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a novel software tool, PANET. First, the time-consuming parts of NetDS were redesigned to be processed in parallel using the OpenCL library. This approach utilizes the full computing power of multi-core central processing units and graphics processing units. Eventually, this made it possible to investigate a large-scale network such as a human signaling network with 1,609 nodes and 5,063 links. We also developed a new function to perform a batch-mode simulation where it generates a lot of random networks and conducts robustness calculations and feed-forward/feedback loop examinations of them. This helps us to determine if the findings in real biological networks are valid in arbitrary random networks or not. We tested our plugin in two case studies based on two large-scale signaling networks and found interesting results regarding relationships between coherently coupled feedforward/feedback loops and robustness. In addition, we verified whether or not those findings are consistently conserved in random networks through batch-mode simulations. Taken together, our plugin is expected to effectively investigate various relationships between dynamics and structural properties in large-scale networks.

This unique physical structure and the associated directionality of physical flows set them apart from most other environments by regulating the dispersal of resident biota and therefore the distribution of biodiversity. The aim of this special issue is to highlight the importance of the river network on structuring biodiversity, particularly through metacommunity dynamics and associated dispersal processes. The issue covers a wide range of topics, including disease spread, nutrient uptake, trophic dynamics, effects of anthropogenic stressors and the joint roles of dispersal and environmental filtering. Contributions employ a broad range of approaches, including field and laboratory experiments, modelling, population genetics and conceptual synthesis. Although these studies represent just a sample of the research that is being performed on biodiversity and metacommunity dynamics in river networks, several important findings have emerged; a common theme being that the structure of the network and spatial dynamics clearly influence the dynamics of populations and communities, and their functions. By taking a broad taxonomic focus (from diatoms and protists to fish), and spanning a large geographic gradient (from the tropics to the subarctic), this special issue provides a broad look at the dynamics that occur in river networks relating to their unique makeup.

Such societies are intriguing, because it is unclear whether stable dominance relationships that form within subgroups are retained upon fusion with other subgroups, and what the implications of rank instability may be at higher levels of ecological organization. Additionally, little is known about how environmental change affects the fission–fusion process, even though environments often fluctuate and are predicted to become increasingly variable, in part due to climate change. Here we investigated the social organization, levels of conflict and stability of dominance relationships during group fusion in a globally invasive fish, the eastern mosquitofish, Gambusia holbrooki. To assess the effect of environmental variation, we conducted group fusion experiments at high and low water depths, to simulate normal and drought conditions, and recorded dominance interactions during prefusion, early fusion and late fusion stages. Individuals formed size-based hierarchies within prefusion groups, although the relationship between size and dominance varied with group fusion. Levels of conflict were affected by group fusion and water depth, with higher levels of conflict after fusion and at low depth. Rank relationships in early and late fusion groups were stable and unaffected by water depth. Finally, there was no evidence of coat-tail effects, as familiarity with the alpha dominant in postfusion groups did not lead to a significant increase in subordinate dominance rank. All in all, these results provide key experimental evidence that environmental change in terms of water level is unlikely to impact social organization or rank stability in response to group fusion in this species. More generally, they indicate that sociality in fission–fusion societies may be relatively robust to changes in both social and environmental contexts. © 2017 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour","coat-tail; conflict; dominance; fish; fission–fusion; Gambusia; hierarchy; mosquitofish; sociality; water level","cyprinid; dominance; drought; environmental change; eusociality; familiarity; group behavior; hierarchical system; invasive species; social network; social organization; water depth; water level; Animalia; Gambusia; Gambusia affinis; Gambusia holbrooki",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020294172

Whilst the environmental and economic impacts of this industry have been studied, there is a lack of research on the social impacts of oyster farming on the communities and the individuals who reside therein. The study extends a Five Capitals Framework (environmental, produced, social, institutional and human assets) for assessing rural sustainability by applying it to address the social impacts of the oyster industry in the Eyre Peninsula's five principal oyster farming communities. The study combines quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques, with triangulation of the data, to demonstrate that oyster farming has had a predominantly positive effect on the social fabric. More young people are staying in the communities because of the availability of oyster-related employment. This is generating more participation in local sporting teams alongside other benefits, including more government funding for infrastructure, better educational opportunities, increased community spirit, being 'on the map', global oyster sales and tourism, as well as economic growth. There are also more social network linkages, increased community pride, and strengthened social capital, though competition for employment from the state's fast-growing mining sector may threaten the industry's future.

In this review, I briefly describe some key findings from phylogenetic comparative approaches, focusing on analyses of parasite richness that use the Global Mammal Parasite Database. While these studies have provided new answers to fundamental questions, new questions have arisen, including questions about the underlying epidemiological mechanisms that produce the broader phylogenetic patterns. I discuss two examples in which theoretical models have given us new traction on these comparative questions. First, drawing on findings of a positive association between range use intensity and the richness of helminth parasites, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to investigate the underlying drivers of this pattern. From this model, we are gaining deeper understanding of how range use intensity results in greater exposure to parasites, thus producing higher prevalence in the simulated populations-and, plausibly, higher parasite richness in comparative analyses. Second, I show how a model of disease spread on social networks provides solid theoretical foundations for understanding the effects of sociality and group size on parasitism across primate species. This study further revealed that larger social groups are more subdivided, which should slow the spread of infectious diseases. This effect could offset the increased disease risk expected in larger social groups, which has yet to receive strong empirical support in our comparative analyses. In addition to these examples, I discuss the need for more meta-analyses of individual-level phenomena documented in the field, and for greater linkage between theoretical modeling and field research. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Comparative study; Disease ecology; Epidemiology; Parasitism; Theoretical modeling","comparative study; database; disease spread; epidemiology; flatworm; global perspective; group size; infectious disease; meta-analysis; parasite; parasite prevalence; parasitism; phylogenetics; primate; range size; theoretical study; wild population; animal; animal behavior; biological model; disease transmission; ecology; host parasite interaction; immunology; microbiology; parasitology; population density; primate; primate disease; research; review; social behavior; virology; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Ecology; Host-Parasite Interactions; Models, Biological; Population Density; Primate Diseases; Primates; Research; Social Behavior; Mammalia; Primates; Vermes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860331068

Although there is increasing evidence that many animal species use information acquired from conspecics to assess the suitability of potential breeding sites, little is known about how the use of this social information is modified by biotic and abiotic conditions. We used an automated playback experiment to simulate two types of social information, post-breeding public information and pre-breeding location cues, to determine the relative importance of these cues for breeding site selection by a migratory songbird, the American redstart (Setophaga ruticilla). In addition, we used stable hydrogen isotopes to determine the dispersal status of individuals that responded to our experimental treatments and quantify whether long-distance dispersers use different social cues to select breeding sites compared to philopatric individuals. We found that points that received pre-breeding location cue treatments were signi cantly more likely to be settled by redstarts than control points that received no playback. However, we found no evidence the redstarts used post-breeding public information gathered during one season to select breeding sites the following year. Breeding site habitat structure was also a strong predictor of settlement probability, indicating that redstarts modi ed the use of social information based on habitat cues. Furthermore, stable hydrogen isotope signatures from individuals that responded to location cue treatments suggest that long-distance dispersers may rely more heavily on these cues than local recruits. Collectively, these results indicate that redstarts use multiple sources of information to select breeding sites, which could buffer individuals from selecting suboptimal sites when they breed in unfamiliar locations or when habitat quality becomes decoupled from social cues. © 2015 British Ecological Society.","Conspecific attraction; Deuterium; Habitat selection; Location cues; Public information; Setophaga ruticilla; Social information","automation; breeding site; conspecific; deuterium; dispersal; experimental design; habitat structure; long range transport; migratory population; recruitment (population dynamics); site selection; social network; songbird; Animalia; Aves; Passeri; Setophaga; Setophaga ruticilla; animal; animal dispersal; environment; female; male; Maryland; physiology; reproduction; season; social behavior; songbird; Animal Distribution; Animals; Environment; Female; Male; Maryland; Reproduction; Seasons; Social Behavior; Songbirds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943451570

A progressive livestock manager realizes that his business must consider potential responses by individual people and firms (producers, consumers, businesses), as well as broader impacts within their supply chains and industries, when considering the potential threats (or opportunities) from an animal disease outbreak. To be an active voice in the formation of animal disease management and control policies that may influence the livestock sector, industry leaders may also need to understand the public policy perspectives on regional, national and international levels. As a set, the articles provide a balanced overview of private and public research, in addition to motivating a stronger connection between social and managerial economics. Previous analyses of animal disease impacts, policies and management range from producer level to national welfare impacts. Yet, after a major disease and market event, stakeholders seek a single economic measure of loss, all-inclusive of impacts.

Here, we review the past two decades of research, identifying knowledge gaps and new directions. Two coral reef fishes, with social systems similar to other cooperative breeders, have emerged as models: the clown anemonefish Amphiprion percula and the emerald goby Paragobiodon xanthosoma. In these systems, non-breeders do not forgo their own reproduction to gain indirect genetic benefits. Rather, they do so because they stand to inherit the territory in the future and there are strong ecological and social constraints. The reasons why breeders tolerate non-breeders remain obscure, though it is plausibly a combination of weak kin selection, bet-hedging, and benefits mediated via mutualistic interactions with cnidarian hosts. The latter is particularly interesting, given the parallels with other social animals with mutualistic partners, such as acacia ants. Looking beyond the two model species, our attention is turning to species with more complex social organization, such as the damselfish Dascyllus aruanus. Here, variable group stability, conflict intensity, and reproductive skew provide opportunities to test theories of social evolution that have only been tested in a few taxa. New methods like social network analysis are enabling us to uncover more subtle effects of ecology on social interactions. More recently, comparative methods have yielded insights into the correlates of interspecific variation in sociality in the genera to which our model species belong. Phylogenetically controlled contrasts within the genus Gobiodon, have revealed the role of ecology, life history traits, and their interaction in sociality: smaller bodied species are more social than larger bodied species, which are only social on large corals. As climate change affects coral reefs, there is a pressing need to understand the many ways in which environmental disturbance influences these unique social systems. In sum, coral reef fishes have enabled us to test the robustness of current theories of social evolution in new taxa and environments, and they have generated new insights into social evolution that are applicable to a wider variety of taxa. © Copyright © 2021 Rueger, Branconi, Froehlich, Heatwole, Wong and Buston.","cooperative breeding; coral reef fishes; eusociality; reproductive skew; social evolution; sociality",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106185073

We coupled age-structured stock assessment models and fish bioenergetics models for lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), walleye (Sander vitreus), and lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis). The model system also included time-varying parameters or variables of growth, length–mass relations, maturity schedules, energy density, and diets. These time-varying models reflected the dynamic connections that a fish cohort responded to year-to-year ecosystem changes at different ages and body sizes. We found that the ratio of annual predation by lake trout, Chinook salmon, and walleye combined with the biomass indices of age-1 and older alewives (Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) increased more than tenfold during 1987–2010, and such increases in predation pressure were structured by relatively stable biomass of the three piscivores and stepwise declines in the biomass of alewives and rainbow smelt. The piscivore stability was supported by the use of alternative energy pathways and changes in relative composition of the three piscivores. In addition, lake whitefish became a new piscivore by feeding on round goby (Neogobius melanostomus). Their total fish consumption rivaled that of the other piscivores combined, although fish were still a modest proportion of their diet. Overall, the use of alternative energy pathways by piscivores allowed the increases in predation pressure on dominant diet species. © 2015, National Research Council of Canada.

In the present study, we used Carassius gibelio (Prussian carp) as a model organism to research the impact of scantily explored benzodiazepine phenazepam (PNZ) on feeding behaviour and the related molecular mechanisms of PNZ action at single-cell and singlereceptor levels.We found that the feeding activity of C. gibelio is under control of GABARs via two distinct mechanisms: orthosteric (triggered by GABA binding site) and allosteric (triggered by benzodiazepine binding site). PNZ displayed clear stimulatory effects on both mechanisms in a GABA-dependent manner.

However, in complex, highly connected systems, such as marine environments connected by ocean currents, populations spread dynamically in both space and time via transient connectivity links. This results in nondeterministic future distributions of species in which local populations emerge dynamically and concurrently over a large area. The challenge, therefore, is to choose intervention locations that will maximize the effectiveness of the control efforts. We propose a novel method to manage dynamic species invasions and outbreaks that identifies the intervention locations most likely to curtail population expansion by selectively targeting local populations most likely to expand their future range. Critically, at any point during the development of the invasion or outbreak, the method identifies the local intervention that maximizes the long-term benefit across the ecosystem by restricting species' potential to spread. In so doing, the method adaptively selects the intervention targets under dynamically changing circumstances. To illustrate the effectiveness of the method we applied it to controlling the spread of crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster sp.) outbreaks across Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Application of our method resulted in an 18-fold relative improvement in management outcomes compared with a random targeting of reefs in putative starfish control scenarios. Although we focused on applying the method to reducing the spread of an unwanted species, it can also be used to facilitate the spread of desirable species through connectivity networks. For example, the method could be used to select those fragments of habitat most likely to rebuild a population if they were sufficiently well protected. © 2016 Society for Conservation Biology.","Acanthaster; adaptive management; conectividad; connectivity; decision theory; dynamic digraph; dígrafo dinámico; invasives; invasoras; manejo adaptativo; redes espaciales; spatial network; teoría de la decisión","adaptive management; biological invasion; connectivity; conservation planning; decision analysis; environmental management; fish; habitat conservation; invasive species; population structure; range expansion; spatiotemporal analysis; targeting; animal; Anthozoa; Australia; ecosystem; environmental protection; population dynamics; starfish; Animals; Anthozoa; Australia; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Population Dynamics; Starfish; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Queensland; Acanthaster; Acanthaster planci; Asteroidea; Callithrix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027940721

The system collects information in much the same way as other similar systems (e.g. HealthMap, BioCaster). However, the information collected undergoes minimal automated analysis, and analysis is largely left to AquaticHealth.net's users. The result is an automated system of intelligence gathering, combined with a manual system of intelligence analysis. This approach relies on a large number of users, and so AquaticHealth.net relies on an open-intelligence analysis method: any user can publish their own analyses for all to see and analyse further. By combining automated data collection and human analysis, AquaticHealth.net will provide fast and accurate forecasts, accompanied with nuanced explanations. These methods can be applied to other areas of biosecurity and disease surveillance. Location: Canberra, Australia; College Park, Maryland, USA; Melbourne, Australia. Methods: Automated: AquaticHealth.net performs hourly scans of an array of RSS feeds, blogs, social networks and news sites. It analyses this information and removes redundancies and applies taxonomy and geospatial tags. The information is then pushed to the Daily Scan, where users then analyse it further. Manual: Users assess the information for inaccuracies and its importance. They decide whether an article should be a disease alert, which is emailed to all users. Users can change tags, edit reports, add commentary, apply rankings, change search terms and summarize issues in the Emerging Issues blog (formerly a wiki). Results: AquaticHealth.net publishes seven daily reports and 2 weekly disease alerts (on average). Ninety per cent of CEFAS's (www.cefas.defra.gov.uk) Emerging Disease Updates cite AquaticHealth.net. The Australian Sub-Committee for Aquatic Animal Health (SCAAH) uses the system to compile quarterly reports. The Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) uses AquaticHealth.net to make forecasts-for example, used aquaculture equipment is a high-risk pathway for OsHV. AquaticHealth.net's users forecasted an increase in emerging marine finfish disease outbreaks in Southeast Asia and are actively watching this issue. Main conclusions: AquaticHealth.net's open-intelligence approach has proven to be an effective and flexible biosecurity forecasting method. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Aggregation; Aquatic animal health; Biosecurity; Crowdsourcing; Intelligence; Risk analysis","aquatic community; automation; biosafety; disease incidence; forecasting method; health monitoring; Internet; risk assessment; taxonomy; Australia; Australian Capital Territory; Canberra; Maryland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877337072

Ignoring mate sampling may underestimate female choice because the smaller the sample taken by individuals of the choosing sex, the weaker the correlation between sexually selected traits and the mating success among individuals of the chosen sex. A main factor promoting mate sampling is the spatial distribution of individuals. Thus, including distances in models of mate choice should improve estimates of mate choosiness. However, spatial distances between individuals are pairwise variables and cannot be readily included in the models commonly used to investigate mate choice. We address this limitation by proposing a multinomial network (MN) model of mate choice, and comparing its performance with a previously published binomial generalized linear mixed model. Both models allow the inclusion of pairwise predictors, accommodating spatial distances between individuals in analyses of mate choice. We evaluated the performance of these models in detecting directional and assortative mate choice using different simulated datasets: with and without spatial information, and with and without spatial autocorrelation of male and female traits. We also took samples of different sizes from the simulated datasets to evaluate the models’ performance when data are incomplete. Using both models, the exclusion of spatial information underestimated mate choice. Small sample sizes from the simulated populations led to underestimated directional mate choice, whereas assortative choice estimates were unbiased. Taking larger samples increased statistical power, and confidence interval coverage of both models. Spatial autocorrelation decreased the power of both models, but the MN model was less affected by it. We conclude that including space in analyses of mate choice increases our ability to detect and accurately estimate mate choice using observational data. The MN model is a powerful and flexible tool that should be used in studies of mate choice in spatially structured populations. Moreover, the model can be used to investigate choice in other contexts, such as floral constancy by pollinators and host plant selection by phytophagous insects. © 2017 The Authors.

Networks of no-take marine reserves are promising management tools because of their potential to (1) protect coastal ecosystem structure and functioning, (2) benefit exploited populations and fisheries, (3) improve scientific understanding of marine ecosystems, and (4) provide enriched opportunities for non-extractive human activities. By protecting marine ecosystems and their populations, no-take reserve networks can reduce risk by providing important insurance for fishery managers against overexploitation of individual populations. Replicated reserves also foster strong scientific testing of fishery and conservation management strategies. Reserve networks will require social acceptance, adequate enforcement, and effective scientific evaluation to be successful. Processes for reserve establishment should accommodate adaptive management so boundaries and regulations can be modified to enhance performance. However, even well-designed reserve networks will require continued conservation efforts outside reserve boundaries to be effective. Establishing networks of no-take reserves is a process-oriented, precautionary management strategy that protects functional attributes of marine ecosystems. As an addition to fishery management practices and other conservation efforts, no-take reserve networks may improve the status of exploited populations while conserving marine resources for future generations.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033229559

Five samples were prepared: heating treatment (control), optimal high-pressure treatment (P), optimal MTGase treatment (M), MTGase combined with high pressure (MP), MTGase combined with setting, and high pressure (MSP). MSP exhibited the highest gel strength, a higher water-holding capacity than the control sample. A fibrous structure was viewed in MSP sample under scanning electron microscope, which was due mainly to the greater proportion of hydrogen bonds formed during setting prior to high-pressure treatment and non-disulfide covalent bonding catalyzed by MTGase under high-pressure treatment. The result of sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that with the addition of MTGase, surimi protein established a tridimensional network. The dynamic rheological results showed that the addition of MTGase enhanced the solid-like nature of the gels. Practical applications: The optimal process for improving surimi gels of greater lizardfish was determined. The effect of high-pressure treatment after setting could promote the ability of the MTGase to form covalent bonds. A lower pressure was recommended for surimi processing combined with MTGase.

This article explores how social–ecological systems (SES) science can address rangeland management challenges associated with the survival and recovery of ESA-listed fish species on federal lands where cattle grazing is a dominant type of land use. We focus on the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon, where the Mountain Social Ecological Observatory Network's Blue Mountains Working Group is collaborating with diverse stakeholders to develop and test a novel grazing system designed to reduce the impact of cattle on riparian areas using an SES science approach.

At the same time, we see wild animals such as wolves actually settling in human landscapes. This forces us to rethink how we can live together with other living beings, with whom we share one earth. The contributions in this book section can be seen as attempts to do just that. However, these developments also challenge the traditional ethical approach towards wild animals, concisely worded as “Let them be”. That falls short in the current era, in which semi-wild, contact zone, and liminal animals are recognized. Animals, whether living in natural or human landscapes, all make opportunistic use of all sorts of resources – including human ones. If circumstances change, either due to natural or human-made causes, they will enter into new interactions with their environment to survive. They are nodes in a dynamic, heterogeneous network of dependency relationships that increasingly includes humans. In this chapter a framework is proposed to indicate the presence of wild animals in the human landscape based on the species’ adaptability and their degree of dependence on humans. The framework shows that species strongly differ in their vulnerability and that a diversity of measures is required in a world in which human and animal domains increasingly merge. Recognizing that we do not have exclusive rights to the earth implies an impersonal care perspective for wild animals as fellow-earthlings. It requires the reconsideration of our ethics, philosophies, culture and politics. © The Author(s) 2021.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105487911

Several theories have been developed to explain clustering in, for instance, multi-cellular organisms, ant colonies, bee hives, flocks of birds, schools of fish, and animal herds. A persistent puzzle, however, is the clustering of opinions in human populations, particularly when opinions vary continuously, such as the degree to which citizens are in favor of or against a vaccination program. Existing continuous opinion formation models predict ""monoculture"" in the long run, unless subsets of the population are perfectly separated from each other. Yet, social diversity is a robust empirical phenomenon, although perfect separation is hardly possible in an increasingly connected world. Considering randomness has not overcome the theoretical shortcomings so far. Small perturbations of individual opinions trigger social influence cascades that inevitably lead to monoculture, while larger noise disrupts opinion clusters and results in rampant individualism without any social structure. Our solution to the puzzle builds on recent empirical research, combining the integrative tendencies of social influence with the disintegrative effects of individualization. A key element of the new computational model is an adaptive kind of noise. We conduct computer simulation experiments demonstrating that with this kind of noise a third phase besides individualism and monoculture becomes possible, characterized by the formation of metastable clusters with diversity between and consensus within clusters. When clusters are small, individualization tendencies are too weak to prohibit a fusion of clusters. When clusters grow too large, however, individualization increases in strength, which promotes their splitting. In summary, the new model can explain cultural clustering in human societies. Strikingly, model predictions are not only robust to ""noise""-randomness is actually the central mechanism that sustains pluralism and clustering. © 2010 Mäs et al.",,"article; computer model; cultural anthropology; individualization; mathematical model; population dynamics; population size; social behavior; social network; social structure; algorithm; animal; biological model; biology; computer simulation; crowding; human; individuality; methodology; public opinion; social problem; Animalia; Apoidea; Aves; Algorithms; Animals; Anomie; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Cultural Diversity; Humans; Individuality; Mass Behavior; Models, Biological; Public Opinion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78349272023

Common prior to white-nose syndrome, the population of this bat species has declined to functional extirpation in some regions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, including portions of the central Appalachians. Our long-term research in the central Appalachians has shown that maternity colonies of this species form non-random assorting networks in patches of suitable trees that result from longand short-term forest disturbance processes, and that roost loss can occur with these disturbances. Following two consecutive prescribed burns on the Fernow Experimental Forest in the central Appalachians, West Virginia, USA, in 2007 to 2008, post-fire counts of suitable black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.; the most selected species for roosting) slightly decreased by 2012. Conversely, post-fire numbers of suitable maple (Acer spp. L.), primarily red maple (Acer rubrum L.), increased by a factor of three, thereby ameliorating black locust reduction. Maternity colony network metrics such as roost degree (use) and network density for two networks in the burned compartment were similar to the single network observed in unburned forest. However, roost clustering and degree of roost centralization was greater for the networks in the burned forest area. Accordingly, the short-term effects of prescribed fire are slightly or moderately positive in impact to day-roost habitat for the northern long-eared bat in the central Appalachians from a social dynamic perspective. Listing of northern long-eared bats as federally threatened will bring increased scrutiny of immediate fire impacts from direct take as well as indirect impacts from long-term changes to roosting and foraging habitat in stands being returned to historic fire-return conditions.

An HMM assumes that each data point from a time series of observations stems from one of N possible states. The states are loosely connected to behavioral modes that manifest themselves at the temporal resolution at which observations are made. Due to advances in tag technology and tracking with digital video recordings, data can be collected at increasingly fine temporal resolutions. Yet, inferences at time scales cruder than those at which data are collected and, which correspond to larger-scale behavioral processes, are not yet answered via HMMs. We include additional hierarchical structures to the basic HMM framework, incorporating multiple Markov chains at various time scales. The hierarchically structured HMMs allow for behavioral inferences at multiple time scales and can also serve as a means to avoid coarsening data. Our proposed framework is one of the first that models animal behavior simultaneously at multiple time scales, opening new possibilities in the area of animal movement and behavior modeling. We illustrate the application of hierarchically structured HMMs in two real-data examples: (i) vertical movements of harbor porpoises observed in the field, and (ii) garter snake movement data collected as part of an experimental design.

We propose that infectious diseases are a significant cost associated with cultural transmission. We investigated two hypotheses that may explain such a connection: that social learning and exploratory behaviours (specifically, innovation and extractive foraging) either compensate for existing infection or increase exposure to infectious agents. We used Bayesian comparative methods, controlling for sampling effort, body mass, group size, geographical range size, terrestriality, latitude and phylogenetic uncertainty. Across 127 primate species, we found a positive association between pathogen richness and rates of innovation, extractive foraging and social learning. This relationship was driven by two independent phenomena: socially contagious diseases were positively associated with rates of social learning, and environmentally transmitted diseases were positively associated with rates of exploration. Because higher pathogen burdens can contribute to morbidity and mortality, we propose that parasitism is a significant cost associated with the behavioural patterns that underpin culture, and that increased pathogen exposure is likely to have played an important role in the evolution of culture in both non-human primates and humans. © 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Citrus rhizosphere inhabits 45 species of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), belonging to seven genera like Acaulospora, Entrophospora, Gigaspora, Glomus, Pacispora, Sclerocystis and Scutellospora. These AMF can be associated with the roots for the formation of arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, who would enlarge the contacted areas of roots to soil and be regarded as a potential soil biofertilizer, thereby promoting citrus nutrients. In addition to the vital function, mycorrhizas in citrus display other roles in soils and plants. Most AMF species usually significantly increase plant growth and fruit quality of citrus plants, but occasionally inhibit or did not impact plant growth. The inoculation with AMF obviously improved root system architecture of citrus, thereby conferring greater ability of the host plant to obtain soil resources. Mycorrhizas can develop an extensive common mycorrhizal network to colonize neighbouring citrus or other plants for underground communication. AMF release a special glycoprotein, glomalin, into the soils, which can improve soil structure and contribute soil carbon pools, thus, providing better soil fertility and soil physical-chemical traits. Mycorrhizas enhance tolerance of citrus plants to drought stress, salt stress, high temperature but not low temperature, flooding, elevated [CO2], diseases, and insect pests in terms of various physiological and molecular approaches. Based on the mycorrhizal functionings, citrus production will consider mycorrhizal management of citrus orchard and new perspectives are also outlined. © 2017, Indian Council of Agricultural Research.

We evaluated anthropogenic effects on spatial connections among populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and steelhead (O. mykiss) (designated as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act) in the lower Columbia and Willamette rivers. For several anthropogenic-effects scenarios, we used graph theory to characterize the spatial relation among populations. We plotted variance in population size against connectivity among populations. In our scenarios, reduced habitat quality decreased the size of populations and hydropower dams on rivers led to the extirpation of several populations, both of which decreased connectivity. Operation of fish hatcheries increased connectivity among populations and led to patchy or panmictic populations. On the basis of our results, we believe recolonization of the upper Cowlitz River by fall and spring Chinook and winter steelhead would best restore metapopulation structure to near-historical conditions. Extant populations that would best conserve connectivity would be those inhabiting the Molalla (spring Chinook), lower Cowlitz, or Clackamas (fall Chinook) rivers and the south Santiam (winter steelhead) and north fork Lewis rivers (summer steelhead). Populations in these rivers were putative sources; however, they were not always the most abundant or centrally located populations. This result would not have been obvious if we had not considered relations among populations in a metapopulation context. Our results suggest that dispersal rate strongly controls interactions among the populations that comprise salmon metapopulations. Thus, monitoring efforts could lead to understanding of the true rates at which wild and hatchery fish disperse. Our application of graph theory allowed us to visualize how metapopulation structure might respond to human activity. The method could be easily extended to evaluations of anthropogenic effects on other stream-dwelling populations and communities and could help prioritize among competing conservation measures. © 2011 Society for Conservation Biology.","Análisis espacial; Anthropogenic; Antropogénico; Conectividad; Connectivity; Network; Red; Spatial analysis; Viabilidad; Viability","anthropogenic effect; connectivity; ecosystem resilience; endangered species; environmental disturbance; human activity; marine environment; metapopulation; population size; salmonid; spatial distribution; animal; article; demography; ecosystem; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; human; human activities; methodology; population density; rainbow trout; river; salmon; United States; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Demography; Ecosystem; Human Activities; Humans; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Oregon; Population Density; Rivers; Salmon; United States; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Oncorhynchus tshawytscha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052577701

Graph (network) theory is increasingly used to understand and predict landscape functional connectivity, as network properties can provide crucial information regarding the resilience of a system to landscape disturbances, e.g. removal of habitat patches. The temporal dimension of movement patterns, however, is not generally included in network analysis, which can lead to a discrepancy between observed space use and landscape connectivity. Reaction–advection–diffusion models, when coupled with network analysis, could provide a powerful mechanistic framework based upon spatio-temporal dimensions of animal movement, but this approach remains poorly developed for ecological studies. We developed a mechanistic space use model that considers both residency time in resource patches and movement amongst those patches within a spatial network. The framework involves two main steps: first, the network topology that best reflects functional connectivity for the study system is identified; second, a spatio-temporal flow dynamic is implemented within the network using reaction–advection–diffusion modelling. To illustrate the approach, we used observations of radiocollared plains bison Bison bison bison that were travelling in a meadow network within a forest matrix. In the model application, we found that the graph best reflecting the functional connectivity of bison was a complex graph of ultra-small world scale-free network type. The reaction–advection–diffusion model involved the effect of meadow area and inter-meadow distance on bison travels. Simulations showed that a simple graph or distance-based graphs provided less accurate predictions of bison distribution, while also predicting different management actions to effectively impact bison space use. Our study demonstrates how reaction–advection–diffusion modelling, coupled with network theory, can provide a robust mechanistic framework for predicting animal distribution in dynamic environments. The modelling approach can be applied to a large range of systems that are subjected to rapid environmental changes due to habitat management or natural resource extraction, for example. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that management and conservation planning can strongly depend upon network structure, and that a faulty assessment of network topology can result in poor planning, with potential unexpected impacts on animal distributions. © 2018 The Authors.

These networks are used to identify genes with similar expression dynamics but are prone to introducing false-positive and false-negative relationships, especially in the instance of large and heterogenous datasets. With the aim of optimizing the relevance of edges in GCNs and enhancing global biological insight, we propose a novel approach that involves a data-centering step performed simultaneously per gene and per sub-experiment, called centralization within sub-experiments (CSE). Using a gene set encoding the plant mitochondrial proteome as a case study, our results show that all CSE-based GCNs assessed had significantly more edges within the majority of the considered functional sub-networks, such as the mitochondrial electron transport chain and its complexes, than GCNs not using CSE; thus demonstrating that CSE-based GCNs are efficient at predicting canonical functions and associated pathways, here referred to as the core gene network. Furthermore, we show that correlation analyses using CSE-processed data can be used to fine-tune prediction of the function of uncharacterized genes; while its use in combination with analyses based on non-CSE data can augment conventional stress analyses with the innate connections underpinning the dynamic system being examined. Therefore, CSE is an effective alternative method to conventional batch correction approaches, particularly when dealing with large and heterogenous datasets. The method is easy to implement into a pre-existing GCN analysis pipeline and can provide enhanced biological relevance to conventional GCNs by allowing users to delineate a core gene network. Author Summary: Gene co-expression networks (GCNs) are the product of a variety of mathematical approaches that identify causal relationships in gene expression dynamics but are prone to the misdiagnoses of false-positives and false-negatives, especially in the instance of large and heterogenous datasets. In light of the burgeoning output of next-generation sequencing projects performed on a variety of species, and developmental or clinical conditions; the statistical power and complexity of these networks will undoubtedly increase, while their biological relevance will be fiercely challenged. Here, we propose a novel approach to generate a “core” GCN with enhanced biological relevance. Our method involves a data-centering step that effectively removes all primary treatment/tissue effects, which is simple to employ and can be easily implemented into pre-existing GCN analysis pipelines. The gain in biological relevance resulting from the adoption of this approach was assessed using a plant mitochondrial case study. © Copyright © 2020 Law, Kellgren, Björk, Ryden and Keech.","correlation; gene co-expression network; metabolism; method; plant mitochondria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086578832

However, very little is known about how pathogen pressure has affected the molecular evolution of genes involved in their innate immune system. We have studied the sequence evolution of several immune genes in ants and honeybees. The results show high rates of evolution in both ants and honeybees as measured by the ratio of amino acid changes to silent nucleotide changes, the ratio being clearly higher than in Drosophila immune genes or in nonimmunity genes of bees. This conforms to our expectations based on high pathogen pressure in social insects. The codon-based likelihood method found clear evidence of positive selection only in one ant gene, even though positive selection has earlier been found in both ant and termite immune genes. There is now indication that selection on the amino acid composition of the immune-related genes has been an important part in the fight against pathogens by social insects. However, we cannot distinguish in all the cases whether the high observed dN/dS ratio results from positive selection within a restricted part of the studied genes or from relaxation of purifying selection associated with effective measures of behaviorally based colony-level defenses.

In this review, we first summarize how hydrologic connectivity has been studied for riverine fish capable of moving long distances, and then identify research opportunities that have clear conservation significance. Migratory species, such as anadromous salmonids, are good model organisms for understanding ecological connectivity in rivers because the spatial scale over which movements occur among freshwater habitats is large enough to be easily observed with available techniques; they are often economically or culturally valuable with habitats that can be easily fragmented by human activities; and they integrate landscape conditions from multiple surrounding catchment(s) with in-river conditions. Studies have focussed on three themes: (i) relatively stable connections (connections controlled by processes that act over broad spatio-temporal scales &gt;1000 km2 and &gt;100 years); (ii) dynamic connections (connections controlled by processes acting over fine to moderate spatio-temporal scales ~1-1000 km2 and &lt;1-100 years); and (iii) anthropogenic influences on hydrologic connectivity, including actions that disrupt or enhance natural connections experienced by fish.2. We outline eight challenges to understanding the role of connectivity in riverine fish ecology, organized under three foci: (i) addressing the constraints of river structure; (ii) embracing temporal complexity in hydrologic connectivity; and (iii) managing connectivity for riverine fishes. Challenges include the spatial structure of stream networks, the force and direction of flow, scale-dependence of connectivity, shifting boundaries, complexity of behaviour and life histories and quantifying anthropogenic influence on connectivity and aligning management goals. As we discuss each challenge, we summarize relevant approaches in the literature and provide additional suggestions for improving research and management of connectivity for riverine fishes.3. Specifically, we suggest that rapid advances are possible in the following arenas: (i) incorporating network structure and river discharge into analyses; (ii) increasing explicit consideration of temporal complexity and fish behaviour in the scope of analyses; and (iii) parsing degrees of human and natural influences on connectivity and defining acceptable alterations.

Understanding this relationship is important in at-risk populations, where knowledge of network structure can provide insight into how they may respond to human impacts. Association patterns in the critically endangered eastern Taiwan Strait (ETS) population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, were investigated using the seasonally collected (2007–2010) photo-identification data of 74 individuals. Social network structure was characterized by high strength and reach, features that are thought to be atypical for the species. Standardized lagged association rates were best fitted by a two-level model: short-term associations that dissipated in less than a day, and long-term associations projected to persist nearly 10 years. These persisting relationships were primarily among calves and their inferred mothers. The short-term associations, which were probably limiting the network's modularity, seemed to occur among more weakly associated individuals temporarily participating in large mother–calf groups. When associations were defined by proximity (within one body-length), relationships involving calves were characterized by a significantly high clustering coefficient, and some calves had high associations with other calves and more than one adult, making maternal relationships ambiguous. This could be evidence for cooperative calf rearing, which may be important for calf survivorship and initiating dyadic relationships among calves. Given their apparent uniqueness among populations of this species, the association patterns observed among the ETS S. chinensis, calves and their inferred mothers in particular, could be a response to conditions (small population size, isolation, confined distribution, and anthropogenic stressors) that make long-term cooperative behaviour advantageous. Thus, minimizing human impacts that disrupt social dynamics, such as interactions with fisheries and habitat fragmentation, should help to improve this population's long-term viability.

Thorough documentation of social interactions is crucial to study the causes and consequences of sociality in gregarious animals. Wireless digital transceivers represent a promising tool to revolutionize data collection for the study of social interactions in terms of the degree of automation, data quantity, and quality. Unfortunately, devices for automated proximity sensing via direct communication among animal-borne sensors are usually heavy and do not allow for the investigation of small animal species, which represent the majority of avian and mammalian taxa. We present a lightweight animal-borne sensor node that is built from commercially available components and uses a sophisticated scheme for energy-efficient communication, with high sampling rates at relatively low power consumption. We demonstrate the basic functionality of the sensor node under laboratory conditions and its applicability for the study of social interactions among free-ranging animals. The first field tests were performed on two species of bats in temperate and tropical ecosystems. At <2 g, this sensor node is light enough to observe a broad spectrum of taxa including small vertebrates. Given our specifications, the system was especially sensitive to changes in distance within the short range (up to a distance of 4 m between tags). High spatial resolution at short distances enables the evaluation of interactions among individuals at a fine scale and the investigation of close contacts. This technology opens new avenues of research, allowing detailed investigation of events associated with social contact, such as mating behavior, pathogen transmission, social learning, and resource sharing. Social behavior that is not easily observed becomes observable, for example, in animals living in burrows or in nocturnal animals. A switch from traditional methods to the application of digital transceiver chips in proximity sensing offers numerous advantages in addition to an enormous increase in data quality and quantity. For future applications, the platform allows for the integration of additional sensors that may collect physiological or environmental data. Such information complements social network studies and may allow for a deeper understanding of animal ecology and social behavior. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Automated data collection; Digital telemetry; Encounter logging; Sensor network; Social interactions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959503563

Due to their abundance, road crossings and dams reduce the amount of habitat available to fish that migrate from the sea or lakes into rivers to breed. The benefits to fish of removing any particular barrier depends on its location within the river network, its passability to fish, and the relative position of other barriers within the network. Balancing the trade-offs between ecological and societal values makes choosing among potential removal projects difficult. To facilitate prioritization of barrier removals, we developed an online decision support tool (DST) with three functions: (1) view existing barriers at various spatial scales; (2) modify information about barriers, including removal costs; and (3) run optimization models to identify portfolios of removals that provide the greatest amount of habitat access for a given budget. A survey of available DSTs addressing barrier removal prioritization indicates that barrier visualization is becoming widespread but few tools allow dynamic calculation of connectivity metrics, scenario analysis, or optimization. Having these additional functions, our DST enables organizations to develop barrier removal priorities based on cost-effectiveness in restoring aquatic connectivity. © 2017, American Fisheries Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011333451

In this study, we developed a way to assist decision making in the management of migration barriers so as to increase eel presence throughout the Loire catchment (France). Models were developed according to eel size-class and various different management strategies to improve accessibility, taking into account: (i) all the migration barriers from the tidal limit to different upstream limits (downstream-upstream strategy), (ii) all the migration barriers with a given degree of passability (migration barrier passability class strategy), (iii) all the migration barriers in a given sub-catchment area (sub-catchment strategy) and (iv) all the migration barriers in the entire Loire catchment (global strategy). Eel were actually found to occur in the Loire at about 50% of the sites sampled. The improvement of habitat accessibility by removing all obstacles to colonisation or installing fish passes, for example (global strategy), would lead to eels being found throughout the whole river. If this management strategy is impossible because the high cost, two others, also producing significant eel continental colonisation must be implemented. Either all barriers from the tidal limit with medium passability and/or migration barriers in the sub-catchment area which is closest to the sea and least accessible must be managed. In both cases, the area significantly exploited by eels and the probability that this species will be present will be doubled. However, these results can only be counted on if the fluvial recruitment increases significantly. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons A/S.","Anguilla anguilla; Management; Probability of presence; Strategy","Anguilla anguilla; Anguillidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449463310

Absence of chemical cues in the environment prevents hierarchical settlement among pairs, and enhances time spent in confrontations. The aim of this study was to test the effect of continuously renewed water flow on the establishment of hierarchical dominance in Nile tilapia juveniles. In this condition, a high frequency of attacks and disruption on hierarchical stability were expected because chemical cues for hierarchy maintenance could be washed out. After 3 days in isolation, the fish were paired by standard size but not by sex, and submitted to two conditions: continuously renewed water flow (RENEWED, n = 7) and non-renewed water flow (NONRENEWED, n = 8). The paired fish were placed in an aquarium (40 cm × 30 cm × 40 cm) for 3 h; four 10-min sessions were video-recorded: the first, immediately after the fish were paired and the others 1, 2, and 3 h after pairing. Hierarchy was identified by a dominance index (DI = given attacks/received + given attacks) for each fish. The hierarchical stability was achieved by analyzing the difference between dominant DI and subordinate DI (DI-D). Hierarchy was established in both groups after second session because the DI was significantly higher for one fish of the pair. The frequency of attacks of the dominant fish in RENEWED and NONRENEWED conditions was similar in all observation sessions. The attack frequency by subordinate fish was also similar during the first three sessions (2-h pairing). However, the frequency of attacks by subordinate fish in the RENEWED condition was higher than in the NONRENEWED situation at the fourth observation session (means ± S.E.: RENEWED = 2.83 ± 0.94 × 10 min-1 and NONRENEWED = 0.25 ± 0.16 × 10 min-1; Mann-Whitney, p = 0.04). At this point, a significant reduction of the DI-D was observed (means ± S.E.: RENEWED = 0.70 ± 0.11 and NONRENEWED = 1,00 ± 0.002; Mann-Whitney, p = 0.04). The changes in DI-D were related to more frequent attacks by the subordinated fish in renewed water flow. According to our results, the unsteady agonistic interaction under renewed water flow leads to social instability. Thus, continuous water renewing can wash out relevant chemical substances and therefore disturb the dominance recognition by subordinate fish. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We monitored the movement of sucking lice (Lemurpediculus verruculosus), parasites that require direct host-host contact to be transferred, in their host population of wild mouse lemurs (Microcebus rufus). These lemurs live in the rainforests of Madagascar, are small (40 g), arboreal, nocturnal, solitary foraging primates for which data on population-wide interactions are difficult to obtain. We developed a simple, cost effective method exploiting the intimate relationship between louse and lemur, whereby individual lice were marked, without removal from their host, with an individualized code, and tracked throughout the lemur population. We then tested the hypotheses that 1) the frequency of louse transfers, and thus interactions, would decrease with increasing distance between paired individual lemurs; 2) due to host polygynandry, social interactions and hence louse transfers would increase during the onset of the breeding season; and 3) individual mouse lemurs would vary in their contributions to the spread of lice.Results: We show that louse transfers involved 43.75% of the studied lemur population, exclusively males. Louse transfers peaked during the breeding season, perhaps due to increased social interactions between lemurs. Although trap-based individual lemur ranging patterns are restricted, louse transfer rate does not correlate with the distance between lemur trapping locales, indicating wider host ranging behavior and a greater risk of rapid population-wide pathogen transmission than predicted by standard trapping data alone. Furthermore, relatively few lemur individuals contributed disproportionately to the rapid spread of lice throughout the population.Conclusions: Using a simple method, we were able to visualize exchanges of lice in a population of cryptic wild primates. This method not only provided insight into the previously unseen parasite movement between lemurs, but also allowed us to infer social interactions between them. As lice are known pathogen vectors, our method also allowed us to identify the lemurs most likely to facilitate louse-mediated epidemics. Our approach demonstrates the potential to uncover otherwise inaccessible parasite-host, and host social interaction data in any trappable species parasitized by sucking lice. © 2012 Zohdy et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Lice; Mouse lemur; Parasite; Primate; Social contact; Vector potential","epidemic; host-parasite interaction; louse; pathogen; primate; rodent; Madagascar; Anoplura; Lemur; Lemuridae; Lemurpediculus verruculosus; Microcebus rufus; Phthiraptera; Primates; animal; animal disease; Anoplura; article; Cheirogaleidae; host parasite interaction; Madagascar; male; parasitology; pediculosis; physiology; population dynamics; season; sexual behavior; social behavior; Animals; Anoplura; Cheirogaleidae; Host-Parasite Interactions; Lice Infestations; Madagascar; Male; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Sexual Behavior, Animal; Social Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858713549

On the one hand, studies of plant–plant interactions rarely consider how plants interact with other trophic levels such as pollinators. On the other, studies of plant–animal interactions rarely deal with interactions within trophic levels such as plant–plant competition and facilitation. Thus, to what degree plant interactions affect biodiversity and ecological networks across trophic levels is poorly understood. We manipulated plant communities driven by foundation species facilitation and sampled plant–pollinator networks at fine spatial scale in a field experiment in Sierra Nevada, Spain. We found that plant–plant facilitation shaped pollinator diversity and structured pollination networks. Nonadditive effects of plant interactions on pollinator diversity and interaction diversity were synergistic in one foundation species networks while they were additive in another foundation species. Nonadditive effects of plant interactions were due to rewiring of pollination interactions. In addition, plant facilitation had negative effects on the structure of pollination networks likely due to increase in plant competition for pollination. Our results empirically demonstrate how different network types are coupled, revealing pervasive consequences of interaction chains in diverse communities. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","biodiversity; competition; ecological networks; ecosystem functioning; facilitation; foundation species; interaction chains; interaction diversity; nestedness; pollination","biodiversity; competition (ecology); ecosystem function; facilitation; intraspecific competition; nestedness; plant-pollinator interaction; pollination; pollinator; species diversity; trophic level; California; Sierra Nevada [California]; Spain; United States; Animalia; animal; biodiversity; insect; plant; pollination; Spain; Animals; Biodiversity; Insecta; Plants; Pollination; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061225332

In this context, it is critical to better understand animal movements and gene flow to develop appropriate conservation and land management measures. It is also important to better understand difference between sexes in space use and spatial scale of dispersal. We studied the common adder (Vipera berus), an elusive snake species with low mobility that is facing a substantial decline in Europe. A systematic sampling was carried out to clarify the dispersal pattern at a fine spatial scale (10 × 7 km2) in a rural landscape with both semi-natural (preserved heathlands, hedgerow networks) and degraded (crops, roads) habitats. Based on 280 captured adults and using 11 microsatellite markers, we detected no marked genetic differentiation, however, we detected relatively strong isolation-by-distance (IBD). Under IBD, we quantified a low neighborhood size (Ns ≈ 50) associated with limited natal dispersal (σ ≤ 1 km). We detected sex-biased dispersal in favor of males, but the pattern was dependent on the spatial scale considered. Our results also suggest that there is higher genetic diversity in the preserved habitat, notably among males. Overall, our study underlines the importance of sex variation in dispersal, and the spatial scale of landscape effects. This contrast between sexes should be considered to improve functional connectivity at fine spatial scales for reptile conservation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Gene flow; Genetic diversity; Sex-biased dispersal; Snake; Spatial autocorrelation",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105526959

Analyses were conducted on sequences obtained from 91 individuals collected from eight sampling sites in five different rivers, from two specimens provided by the Ichthyological Centre of Rome and mitochondrial sequences of Barbus spp. retrieved from GenBank. Presumptive classification based on external morphological characters was not confirmed by genetic analysis, by means of which all specimens collected in the Marches Region were ascribed to Barbus plebejus. Genetic diversity values (h and π) of sampling groups were all different from 0 except the one sample collected from the upper reaches of the River Tenna, above a hydroelectric dam. Population connectivity and colonization patterns of the studied area were inferred from an analysis of molecular variance distribution and evolutionary relationships among haplotypes. The results point to different levels of isolation among sampling groups due to ecological and anthropogenic factors and the effect of an artificial barrier on genetic variability and conservation status of the population. Finally, this study confirms the uncertainty associated with systematic classification of Barbus spp. based on morphological characters due to the phenotypic plasticity of the species.

Risk factors for various diseases in cattle, swine and chickens include aspects of both the physical and social environment. In this paper we review literature linking the social environment to illness in farm animals, drawing from a conceptual framework developed primarily in the human and laboratory animal literature. To date, researchers have identified various social determinants of disease, have linked social stressors to biological intermediaries and clinical signs of disease, and have established individual behavioural and neuroendocrine differences in susceptibility to disease. Further, ill animals reduce social behaviours as part of a suite of 'sickness behaviours'. In animal agriculture, the social environment is controlled by management practices implemented on individual farms. Globally, farm sizes are growing, but there is no clear link between farm size and disease incidence. Rather, researchers have tied specific grouping practices, such as moving cows between groups, to increased disease risk, and have begun to determine the biological chain connecting the social world to biological determinants of disease. Studies with farm animals have also established individual variation in behavioural and neuroendocrine response to these practices. Some individuals are more reactive to changes in their social environment than others; however, there remains no consensus on how to recognize these at-risk animals. Additionally, despite the potential role in disease detection, little farm animal work has investigated whether a reduction in social behaviours could be used as early predictors of disease. We end the review by urging further farm animal research to determine the relationship between the social environment and disease, utilizing the concepts and methodologies that have been developed in the human and laboratory animal literature. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Health; Immunity; Sickness behaviour; Social behaviour","cattle; conceptual framework; disease severity; immunity; literature review; livestock farming; pig; poultry; risk factor; social behavior; Animalia; Bos; Gallus gallus; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860236052

Aquatic food security is achieved when a food supply is sufficient, safe, sustainable, shockproof and sound: sufficient, to meet needs and preferences of people; safe, to provide nutritional benefit while posing minimal health risks; sustainable, to provide food now and for future generations; shock-proof, to provide resilience to shocks in production systems and supply chains; and sound, to meet legal and ethical standards for welfare of animals, people and environment. Here, we present an integrated assessment of these elements of the aquatic food system in the United Kingdom, a system linked to dynamic global networks of producers, processors and markets. Our assessment addresses sufficiency of supply from aquaculture, fisheries and trade; safety of supply given biological, chemical and radiation hazards; social, economic and environmental sustainability of production systems and supply chains; system resilience to social, economic and environmental shocks; welfare of fish, people and environment; and the authenticity of food. Conventionally, these aspects of the food system are not assessed collectively, so information supporting our assessment is widely dispersed. Our assessment reveals trade-offs and challenges in the food system that are easily overlooked in sectoral analyses of fisheries, aquaculture, health, medicine, human and fish welfare, safety and environment. We highlight potential benefits of an integrated, systematic and ongoing process to assess security of the aquatic food system and to predict impacts of social, economic and environmental change on food supply and demand. © 2016 Crown copyright.

Few studies have attempted to measure at what distances from nursery habitats these fish migrations (connectivity) cease to exist and how the abundance, biomass and proportion of nursery species change on coral reefs along distance gradients away from nursery areas. The present study examines seascape spatial arrangement, including distances between habitats, and its consequences on connectivity within a tropical seascape in Mozambique using a seascape ecology approach. Fish and habitat surveys were undertaken in 2016/2017 and a thematic habitat map was created in ArcGIS, where cover and distances between habitat patches were calculated. Distance to mangroves and seagrasses were significant predictors for abundance and biomass of most nursery species. The proportions of nursery species were highest in the south of the archipelago, where mangroves were present and decreased with distance to nurseries (mangroves and seagrasses). Some nursery species were absent on reef sites farthest from nursery habitats, at 80 km from mangroves and at 12 km from seagrass habitats. The proportion of nursery/non-nursery snapper and parrotfish species, as well as abundance and biomass of seagrass nursery species abruptly declined at 8 km from seagrass habitats, indicating a threshold distance at which migrations may cease. Additionally, reefs isolated by large stretches of sand and deep water had very low abundances of several nursery species despite being within moderate distances from nursery habitats. This highlights the importance of considering the matrix (sand and deep water) as barriers for fish migration. © 2020 The Authors.

However, detailed dynamic gene regulation networks and the core markers involved in different biological processes of pea aphids have not yet been reported. In this study, we obtained the published genomic and transcriptomic data, and performed transcriptome profiling of five pea aphid morphs (winged asexual female, wingless asexual female, wingless sexual female, winged male and wingless male) from each of three pea aphid genotypes, i.e., the transcriptomes from a total of 15 types of pea aphids were analyzed and the type-specific expression of genes in five different morphs was identified. The expression profiling was verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. Moreover, we determined the expression features and co-expression networks of highly variable genes. We also used the ARACNe method to obtain 263 core genes related to different biological pathways. Additionally, eight of the identified genes were aligned with transcription factor families, indicating that they act as transcription factors and regulate downstream genes. Furthermore, we found reliable markers using random forest methodology to distinguish different morphs of pea aphids. Our study provides a systematic and comprehensive approach for analyzing the core genes that may play important roles in a multitude of biological processes from the insect transcriptomes. © 2020 by the authors.

Although many marine animals have potential for long-distance dispersal via a planktonic stage, gene flow among populations separated by large geographic distances is not always evident. Polychaetes are ecologically important and have been used as biological surrogates for marine biodiversity. Some polychaete species are used as bait for recreational fisheries, with this demand supporting commercial fisheries for polychaetes to service the retail bait market. However, despite their ecological and economic importance, very little is known about the life history or population dynamics of polychaetes, and few studies have used genetic or genomic approaches to understand polychaete population connectivity. Here, we investigate the population structure of one commonly collected beachworm species used for bait on the eastern coast of Australia, namely, Australonuphis teres, by using genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism data. We sampled A. teres from hierarchical nested spatial scales along 900 km of the coast in New South Wales. We identified six genetic groups, but there was no clear geographic pattern of distribution. Our results suggest that there is considerable gene flow among the sampled populations. These high-resolution genomic data support the findings of previous studies, and we infer that oceanographic processes promote genetic exchange among polychaete populations in south-eastern Australia. © 2020 Journal Compilation","admixture; fisheries; genotype-by-sequencing; management; polychaete; population structure; SNP","bait; connectivity; genetic analysis; polychaete; spatial analysis; Australonuphis teres; Onuphidae; Polychaeta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085279211

We also investigated the coancestry and effective population size of progeny arrays for conservation and environmental restoration purposes. Open-pollinated seeds were collected from 15 seed trees within the forest fragment, in which all adult trees were mapped, measured and genotyped. Twenty seeds were also collected from the nearest neighbor tree located 1. 2 km from the forest fragment. Our results show that levels of genetic diversity were significantly higher in adults than offspring and significant levels of inbreeding were detected in offspring (F = 0. 226). From paternity analysis, we observed low levels of selfing (s = 8%) and pollen immigration (m = 8%) in the fragment, but very high levels were detected for the isolated tree (s = 20%; m = 75%), indicating that the population and the tree are not reproductively isolated and are connected by patterns of long distance pollen dispersal (maximum detected 1,420 m). Within the forest fragment, the pattern of pollen dispersal was a near neighbor pattern with 49% of the pollen being dispersed within 50 m. The effective population size of the progeny array was low, indicating the need to collect seeds from a large number of seed trees (at least 76) for conservation purposes. The results show that the spatial isolation of the population and isolated tree due to forest fragmentation has not disrupted genetic connectivity; however, spatial isolation does seem to increase selfing and correlated mating. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Gene flow; Mating system; Microsatellite loci; Pollen dispersal; Tropical trees","ancestry; connectivity; conservation genetics; dispersal; effective population size; genetic marker; habitat fragmentation; legume; paternity; pollen rain; reproductive strategy; species conservation; tropical forest; Caesalpinioideae; Copaifera langsdorffii; Fabaceae; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860479732

However, isolating the influence of disparate processes, and dispersal in particular, is challenging. The Grey Shrikethrush, Colluricincla harmonica, is a sedentary woodland-dependent songbird, with learned vocalizations whose incidence in suitable habitat patches falls disproportionally with decline in tree cover in the landscape. Although it has been suggested that gaps in tree cover might act as barriers to its dispersal, the species remains in many remnants of native vegetation in agricultural landscapes, suggesting that it may have responded to habitat removal and fragmentation by maintaining or even increasing dispersal distances. We quantified population connectivity of the Grey Shrike-thrush in a system fragmented over more than 120 years using genetic (microsatellites) and acoustic (song types) data. First, we tested for population genetic and acoustic structure at regional and local scales in search of barriers to dispersal or gene flow and signals of local spatial structuring indicative of restricted dispersal or localized acoustic similarity. Then we tested for effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on genetic and acoustic connectivity by fitting alternative models of mobility (isolation-bydistance [the null model] and reduced and increased movement models) across treeless vs. treed areas. Birds within ;5 km of each other had more similar genotypes and song types than those farther away, suggesting that dispersal and song matching are limited in the region. Despite restricted dispersal detected for females (but not males), populations appeared to be connected by gene flow and displayed some cultural (acoustic) connectivity across the region. Fragmentation did not appear to impact greatly the dispersal of the Grey Shrike-thrush: none of the mobility models fit the genetic distances of males, whereas for females, an isolation-by-distance model could not be rejected in favor of the models of reduced or increased movement through treeless gaps. However, dissimilarities of the song types were more consistent with the model of reduced cultural connectivity through treeless areas, suggesting that fragmentation impedes song type sharing in the Grey Shrike-thrush. Our paper demonstrates that habitat fragmentation hinders important population processes in an Australian woodland bird even though its dispersal is not detectably impacted. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Acoustics; Australia; Central Victoria; Colluricincla harmonica; Grey shrike-thrush; Habitat fragmentation; Isolation-by- resistance; Isolation-by-distance; Landscape bioacoustics; Landscape genetics; Landscape resistance; Population genetics; Spatial autocorrelation","DNA; agricultural land; conservation management; dispersal; ecological modeling; gene flow; genetic analysis; genotype; habitat conservation; habitat fragmentation; habitat loss; native species; population decline; social behavior; song; songbird; vegetation structure; woodland; animal; article; ecosystem; female; genetics; male; physiology; population dynamics; social behavior; songbird; vocalization; Animals; DNA; Ecosystem; Female; Male; Population Dynamics; Social Behavior; Songbirds; Vocalization, Animal; Australia; Victoria [Australia]; Aves; Colluricincla harmonica; Passeri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864206687

Functional connectivity between 90 brain regions was estimated using bivariate correlation analysis and thresholded to construct a set of undirected graphs. Moreover, all of them were subjected to a battery of cognitive assessment, and the correlations between graph metrics and cognitive performance were further analyzed. Our results are as follows: functional brain networks of both SVCI patients and controls showed small-world attributes over a range of thresholds(0.15≤sparsity≤0.40). However, global topological organization of the functional brain networks in SVCI was significantly disrupted, as indicated by reduced global and local efficiency, clustering coefficients and increased characteristic path lengths relative to normal subjects. The decreased activity areas in SVCI predominantly targeted in the frontal-temporal lobes, while subcortical regions showed increased topological properties, which are suspected to compensate for the inefficiency of the functional network. We also demonstrated that altered brain network properties in SVCI are closely correlated with general cognitive and praxis dysfunction. The disruption of whole-brain topological organization of the functional connectome provides insight into the functional changes in the human brain in SVCI. © 2015 Yu et al.

For most coastal areas the strengthening of customary marine tenure, rules and regulations should yield even greater biodiversity and livelihood benefits. Here, we present the conservation planning results from a locally-managed marine area programme initiated by the Government of Aceh, Indonesia, which aimed to empower coastal communities to sustainably and equitably manage marine resources with local government. In 2008 the government established a Marine and Fisheries Task Force to identify priority areas for marine biodiversity (through systematic conservation planning) and coastal communities (through participatory planning). In addition to the existing 264,788 ha of marine management units, systematic planning identified another 53,372 ha. However, the subsequent stakeholder participation phase, involving intensive local consultations, further expanded the locally-managed marine area network by 6,725 ha and to a total of 23 locally-managed marine areas. This combined approach had additional benefits because it generated a strong sense of local ownership. For communities it initiated a process for recognizing their customary claimed areas and resolved overlapping boundaries between neighbouring communities, thereby reducing the likelihood of future conflicts over natural resource use. For government, it provided the basis of a robust governance system, with 34 new or revised decrees being completed and an additional USD 1.6 million being allocated for implementation of locally-managed marine areas. This participatory approach should considerably increase the successful delivery of a sustainable and equitable locally-managed marine area network for Aceh, which has wide application for the South-east Asian region and beyond. © 2012 Fauna & Flora International.","Aceh Green; CLUZ; Community-based; Conservation planning; Marine protected area; Panglima Laot; Social learning networks","best management practice; biodiversity; coastal zone management; community resource management; conservation management; conservation planning; governance approach; learning; local government; local planning; marine park; prioritization; resource use; stakeholder; sustainability; Aceh; Indonesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867436379

Despite the value of this region for waterbirds, very little monitoring has been conducted on Lake Winnipeg, Lake Winnipegosis, or Lake Manitoba in the past three decades and little is known about the smaller boreal lakes in adjacent areas to the north. In June 2011, boat surveys were conducted on 11 boreal lakes in west-central Manitoba and east-central Saskatchewan to examine current abundance and distribution of colonial waterbirds in that region. Data from this survey were compared with abundance of colonial waterbirds on Lake Winnipegosis and Lake Manitoba from an aerial survey of these lakes in 2012. Waterbird colonies were located on 7 of the 11 lakes in 2011 and included Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) (2373 adults, 1134 pairs in 7 colonies), Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) (1367 adults, 772 pairs in 29 colonies), Forster's Terns (Sterna forsteri) (20 adults, 11 pairs in 1 colony), Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) (876 adults, 568 pairs in 23 colonies), and Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) (3752 adults, 16 colonies). Common Terns and Herring Gulls appeared to be predominantly breeders and pair abundance for both species increased in a sigmoidal fashion; lakes &lt;100 km2 in area had few breeding pairs. Numbers of Double-crested Cormorants and especially, Ring-billed Gulls, may have included a sizeable non-breeding component. Densities (pairs/lake area) of Common Terns and Herring Gulls were about 2 and 4 times higher, respectively, on these lakes than on Lake Winnipegosis and Lake Manitoba, while Double-crested Cormorant and Ring-billed Gull densities were higher on lakes Winnipegosis and Manitoba. Additional studies of productivity in relation to lake characteristics and connectivity among colonies throughout the region would further our understanding of the importance and sustainability of waterbird populations in this region of the boreal forest.","Abundance; Boreal; Colonial waterbird; Common Tern; Doublecrested Cormorant; Herring Gull; Larus argentatus; Larus delawarensis; Manitoba; Phalacrocorax auritus; Ring-billed Gull; Saskatchewan; Sterna hirundo","abundance; bird; breeding population; colonial organism; population density; population distribution; species diversity; surveying; Canada; Manitoba; Saskatchewan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890811801

Mountain whitefish is widely distributed, poorly studied and not the focus of restoration. Before the fishway, mountain whitefish were not observed above the dam. Here, we focus on snorkel counts collected at reach and mesohabitat (e.g. pools) scales over 11 summers on the 20-km above-dam segment following restoration. A camera within the ladder provided number, size and movement timing, thereby informing on behaviour and recolonisation. Segment-scale abundance increased following fish passage reaching an asymptote in 7 years, and mountain whitefish were detected throughout the main stem in 10 years. Annual movement through the ladder increased over time and was positively correlated with instream abundance and discharge, but negatively correlated with water temperature. About 60% of fish movements occurred in spring and early summer, potentially for foraging opportunities. Reach-scale abundance peaked between 7 and 10 km from the dam; deep, cool (~10.6 to 11.6°C) conditions characterised these reaches. At the mesohabitat scale, mountain whitefish detection increased with depth and velocity after accounting for distance from the dam. Our results show how restoring longitudinal connectivity allowed this nontarget species to colonise newly available habitat. Their response supports the critical roles of longitudinal connectivity and environmental conditions, that manifest at different spatial scales, in dictating how freshwater fish respond to habitat disturbance. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

All three variables were significantly related to species richness and explained 61 % of the variance in a data set from 55 limnologically similar lakes in northern Wisconsin. We developed additional ANCOVA models to assess the relative effects of these three variables on four functional species groups, including gamefish, riverine, tolerant, and intolerant species. The number of gamefish species was greater in lakes with riparian development than in undeveloped lakes; this is probably related to introductions by management agencies and anglers. Connectivity increased the number of riverine species and intolerant species. Intolerant species may be more abundant because connecting streams provide colonization routes and decrease time between periodic extirpation and recolonization events. In addition, flowing water connections may provide a refuge from winter hypoxia and decrease extirpation rates of intolerant species. Tolerant fishes were ubiquitous on the landscape and unaffected by the measured variables. Because simple landscape variables can dominate assemblage dynamics of small lakes, and human-mediated introductions can increase species richness at low and moderate levels of disturbance, the use of fish as biological indicators for small lake assessment is not practical. © 2009, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"abundance; anthropogenic effect; colonization; connectivity; covariance analysis; environmental impact assessment; fish; functional group; lake; species richness; temperate environment; North America; United States; Wisconsin; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60549085380

However, species co-occurrence can vary over time. Here we demonstrate how temporal dynamics in species co-occurrence influence the ability of managers to choose the best surrogate species. We develop an efficient optimisation formulation that selects the optimal set of complementary surrogate species from any co-occurrence network. We apply it to two Australian datasets on successional bird responses to disturbances of revegetation and fire. We discover that a surprisingly small number of species are required to represent the majority of species co-occurrences at any one time. Because co-occurrence patterns are temporally dynamic, the optimal set of surrogates, and the number of surrogates required to achieve a desired surrogacy power, depend on sampling effort and the successional state of a system. Overlap in optimal sets of surrogates for representing 70% of co-occurring species ranges from zero to 57% depending on when the surrogacy decision is made. Surrogate sets representing early successional communities over-estimate the power of surrogacy decisions at later times. Our results show that in dynamic systems, optimal surrogates might be selected in different ways: 1) use short-term monitoring to choose a larger number of static less-informative surrogates; 2) use long-term monitoring to choose a smaller number of static high-power surrogates that may poorly represent early successional co-occurrence; 3) develop adaptive surrogate selection frameworks with high short-term and long-term surrogacy power that update surrogate sets and capture temporal dynamics in species co-occurrence. Our results suggest vigilance is needed when selecting surrogates for other co-occurring species in dynamic landscapes, as selected surrogates from one time may have reduced effectiveness at a different time. Ultimately, decisions that fail to acknowledge dynamic species co-occurrence will lead to uninformative or redundant surrogates. © 2016 The Authors",,"biodiversity; bird; coexistence; conservation management; conservation status; environmental disturbance; network analysis; revegetation; species occurrence; succession; surrogate method; temporal analysis; wildfire; Australia; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960929756

Stream networks, however, are dynamic in their response to natural- and human-induced disturbance regimes, which results in spatially explicit patterns of temporal variability. Quantifying spatial patterns in habitat (temporal) variability across different sites and identifying those factors associated with different levels of variability are important steps for stream habitat assessments. We evaluated the temporal variability in stream habitat over a 9-year period for 47headwater streams of the interior Columbia River basin. We used repeat-measures analyses to calculate temporal variability as root mean square error for six habitat attributes at each site. Multiple linear regression analyses with root mean square error as the response were then used to quantify which landscape, climate, and disturbance attributes were associated with different levels of temporal variability among habitat attributes. Our results indicated a considerable range of temporal variability in physical stream attributes across sites and an almost fourfold difference in the overall variability at sites. Landscape factors affecting stream power, land management activities, and recent fire regimes were all factors associated with the different levels of temporal variability across sites; surprisingly, we found little association with the different climatic attributes considered herein. The observed differences in temporal variability across sites suggest that a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach tomonitoring stream habitat in response to restoration and management activities may be misleading, particularly in terms of sampling intensity, required resources, and statistical power; thus, in situ measures of temporal variability may be required for accurate assessments of statistical power. © American Fisheries Society 2011.",,"abundance; habitat fragmentation; habitat management; headwater; land management; regression analysis; spatial distribution; temporal variation; Columbia Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869208799

However, many plants display traits associated with a given syndrome, but are visited by multiple pollinators. This situation may indicate the beginning of a pollinator shift or may result in a stable situation with adaptations to different pollinators. In Salvia stachydifolia, a previous study suggested that flower shape is optimized to maximize the contribution to pollination of bees and hummingbirds. Here, we studied three additional aspects of its floral biology: sexual phases, nectar dynamics and breeding system, and examined their connection with pollinators' behaviour to explore the presence of adaptations to bee and/or hummingbird pollination. Methods: Using a greenhouse population, we applied five pollination treatments to characterize breeding system. To determine sexual phases, we recorded flower opening, anther dehiscence, corolla fall and stigma receptivity. Additionally, we characterized nectar volume and concentration dynamics along the day. Finally, to determine pollinator assemblage and visitation patterns, we performed field observations and recorded pollinators' behaviour. Important Findings: Salvia stachydifolia was partially protandrous and self-compatible, but open-pollinated plants attained the highest reproductive success, suggesting that reproduction is mainly dependent on pollinator activity. Bombus opifex bumblebees were the most frequent visitors, but Sappho sparganura hummingbirds dominated visits early in the morning and at dusk. Nectar was typical of bumblebee pollination. We suggest that the bee-hummingbird mixed visitation constitutes an unstable evolutionary situation, making S. stachydifolia an ideal system to understand the ecological circumstances in which pollination shifts occur. © 2021 The Author(s).

Most studies on the effects of inadvertent pharmaceutical exposure focus on the individual level rather than examining behavior within a network of individuals. Within communication networks, interactants send signals to multiple individuals, potentially altering, and being altered by, the behavior of nearby individuals. To address if fluoxetine interferes with communication within a network, male Siamese fighting fish interacted under three audience types (male, female, or no audience) and two exposure conditions (control, fluoxetine). In the control group, findings were similar to prior studies, with males altering gill flaring rate depending on the sex of the audience present. In the exposed group, gill flaring did not differ based on audience type and was lower overall compared to the control, suggesting a reduction in aggression. In contrast, both unexposed and exposed males performed more tail beats when a female audience was present, suggesting that fluoxetine has a context-specific effect on behavior. Behavioral changes during current interactions may affect behavior during later interactions as well as the outcome of future encounters with audience individuals. The influence of fluoxetine on total behavior within an interaction and loss of audience effect suggests it may generate broader changes in communication beyond the exposed individual, causing fitness consequences. This study stresses the importance of studying the effects of inadvertent pharmaceutical exposure on behavior in multiple social contexts to better understand its impacts on complex communication systems. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Audience effects; Communication networks; Fluoxetine; Inadvertent pharmaceutical exposure; Siamese fighting fish; SSRIs","activity pattern; aggregation behavior; behavioral response; drug; fitness; inhibitor; male behavior; perciform; pollution exposure; signaling; social behavior; Macropodinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958041229

Mutualistic networks, such as those of plants and pollinators tend to have a core set of properties that often relate to the resilience of the community, or the ability of the community to retain function and structure after a disturbance. Furthermore, network structure is highly dependent on the number of specialists and generalists; however, it is unclear how different groups of species with various life-history strategies influence network structure. In this study, we evaluated how the composition of plants and pollinators within 16 oak-savanna sites changed across a latitudinal gradient. In addition, we evaluated how the abundance of different groups of plants and pollinators affected network metrics related to resilience. We found that the composition of plants and pollinators varied between ecoregions, while pollinator composition further varied with habitat characteristics. Network metrics displayed no spatial pattern but were related to the abundance of several pollinator groups. Above-ground nesting insects had a positive relationship with nestedness and a negative relationship with modularity, while predatory larvae had a negative relationship with modularity. Thus, above-ground nesting insects and predatory larvae could be expected to increase network resilience. This study emphasizes how spatial scales can influence species compositions, which in turn affects the structure of interactions in the community with implications for resilience. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ecoregions; Modularity; Mutualism; Nestedness; Specialization","community composition; deciduous tree; habitat type; nestedness; plant-pollinator interaction; savanna; spatial variation; Hexapoda; animal; ecosystem; grassland; insect; oak; plant; pollination; Animals; Ecosystem; Grassland; Insecta; Plants; Pollination; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084546588

To address this limitation, spatial-temporal genetic structure using 8 microsatellite loci was assessed across the majority of the species' NE Atlantic distribution. Neutral genetic structuring revealed a background of high gene flow throughout the region, with a superimposed pattern of chaotic genetic patchiness (CGP) linked to stochastic recruitment variability. The CGP was geographically patterned, being prevalent among English Channel samples but absent among North Sea samples, suggesting specific biological (e.g. reproductive ecology) and environmental (seascape) drivers. Such recruitment variability may compromise stock resilience and must be considered within spatial management strategies. Another prominent feature was pronounced differentiation at a single locus for males sampled within a single fjord (Gulmarsfjord) from all other samples, exhibiting the effects of divergent selection. Gulmarsfjord females were genetically similar to all other 'non-fjord' samples, and exhibited a comparative level of differentiation at the outlier locus from the Gulmarsfjord males. Due to known dispersal differences between the sexes, the pattern within Gulmarsfjord can be explained by the intermingling of allochthonous females with resident, locally adapted males and demonstrates the occurrence of fine-scale local adaptation in this species. Collectively, the study highlights how considerable intraspecific eco-evolutionary diversification can occur despite high levels of dispersal/gene flow. © Inter-Research 2017.","Adaptation; Conservation; Dispersal; Gene flow; Sustainability; Sweepstakes recruitment","connectivity; conservation; crab; dispersal; fjord; gene flow; genetic marker; life history; local adaptation; patchiness; population structure; recruitment (population dynamics); Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; English Channel; North Sea; Cancer pagurus; Decapoda (Crustacea)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020427072

Typically though, these models have been developed for analysing the tracks of individual animals and we lose sight of the impact animals have on each other with regards to their movement behaviours. We aim to develop a model with a flexible social framework that allows us to capture that information. Our approach is based on the concept of social hierarchies, and this is embedded in a multivariate diffusion process which models the movement of a group of animals. The possibility of switching between behavioural states facilitates dynamic social behaviours and we augment the observed data with sampled state switching times in order to model the animals' behaviour naturally in continuous time. In addition, this enables us to carry out exact inference in a Bayesian setting with the benefits of being able to handle regular, irregular and missing data. All movement and behaviour parameters are estimated with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We examine the capability of our model with simulated data before fitting it to GPS locations of five wild olive baboons Papio anubis. The results enable us to identify which animals are influencing the movement of others and when, which provides both a dynamic and long-term static insight into the group's social behaviours. Our model offers a flexible method in continuous time with which to model the network of social interactions within animal movement. Doing so avoids the limitations caused by a discrete-time approach and it allows us to capture rich information with regards to a group's social structure, leading to constructive applications in conservation and management decisions. However, currently it is a computationally expensive task to fit the model to data, which in turns limits extending the model to more fruitful but complex cases such as heterogeneity in space or individual characteristics. Furthermore, our social hierarchy approach assumes all relevant animals are tracked and that any interactions have some ordering, both of which narrow the scope within which this approach is appropriate. © 2020 The Authors.

It has been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae) as a key component of the endogenous circadian clock, but its role is largely unknown in some agriculture pests. Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), an important rice pest, exhibits a robust locomotor rhythm. In the present study, we cloned tim gene (ls-tim) from L. Striatellus and investigated its function in the regulation of behavioral rhythms. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed a circadian expression pattern of ls-tim under different light conditions with a trough in the photophase and a peak in the late scotophase. After the knockdown of ls-tim via RNA interference (RNAi), the adults showed an earlier onset of locomotor activity under light/dark cycles and became arrhythmic in constant darkness. ls-tim RNAi also abolished the timing of adult emergence that normally occurs in the early photophase. These results suggest that ls-tim is essential for the light-entrained circadian rhythms in L. Striatellus and provide more insights into the endogenous clock network underlying the behavioral and physiological rhythms of this insect. © The Author(s) 2018.

Understanding how the amount of eDNA collected is affected by spatial and temporal processes needs to become better understood before eDNA quantification can be used in species management. In this study, we analyzed how the amount of eDNA changed across space and time in a high mountain basin where nonnative fish were being removed. We sampled from restoration (sites with fish removal activities; n = 6) and control sites (sites with no fish removal activities where fish were present; n = 3) and found the number and biomass of fish removed were related to the quantities of DNA collected and not related to site position within the drainage. Our results indicate that the amount of eDNA collected in an open system can provide an index of population size despite inherent complications of analyzing a spatially connected and temporally dynamic watershed. However, there are complications when applying these methods in species management: (1) small increases in eDNA density corresponded to large increases in trout density; (2) eDNA and traditional field techniques disproportionately target certain life stages, complicating comparisons between techniques; and (3) eDNA index values may need to be calibrated when sampling different species, life stages, environments, and habitats. We call for further research before this process can be used in a management context. © 2018, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.","Aquatic restoration; Environmental DNA; Quantitative PCR; Water sampling","alpine environment; aquatic ecosystem; DNA; polymerase chain reaction; removal experiment; restoration ecology; salmonid; sampling; spatiotemporal analysis; Salmonidae; Salvelinus fontinalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049170018

In parts of the Indo-Pacific harvest also occurs, often unregulated. Vital information on species ranges and stock structure is lacking for the Indo-Pacific bonefishes. Population declines, data deficiencies, and the absence of management plans result in conservation concerns. Research on bonefishes has also been hindered by taxonomic uncertainty stemming from morphological cryptics and inconsistent nomenclature. Genetic identification is necessary for some bonefishes, due to highly conserved morphology. This study explores verified species occurrences and genetic connectivity for six Indo-Pacific bonefishes. Samples were obtained from 210 bonefish from 16 locations across the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Genetic identification was determined through cytochrome b sequence analyses and population structure assessed with 17 microsatellite loci. Two bonefishes (A. glossodonta and A. oligolepis) are partially sympatric, suggesting multiple species may be supporting the fishery. Additional data are required to fully elucidate fishery composition at local scales and the geographic extent of species ranges. The IUCN Red List vulnerable A. glossodonta may experience increased fishing pressure due to its extensive Indo-Pacific range. Stock structure data support intraspecific genetic connectivity across broad spatial scales. Results suggested weak, non-geographic, genetic population structure in A. glossodonta, and panmixia in A. oligolepis and A. gilberti. The present study highlights the need for further research, and suggests conservation and management strategies for the Indo-Pac bonefishes may need both local and regional components to prevent further declines and localized collapse. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Albula; Cryptic species; Population genetics; Range overlap; Stock identification; Sympatry","connectivity; conservation genetics; conservation management; crypsis; cytochrome; fish; genetic marker; intraspecific interaction; nomenclature; population decline; population genetics; range expansion; Red List; stock assessment; sympatry; taxonomy; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Albula; Albula glossodonta; Albulidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943666302

To understand the correlative structure of the bacterial community as a network, we studied root microbiota of eight ancient and modern Lactuca sativa cultivars and the wild ancestor Lactuca serriola by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries. The lettuce microbiota was dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteriodetes, as well as abundant Chloroflexi and Actinobacteria. Cultivar specificity comprised 12.5% of the species. Diversity indices were not different between lettuce cultivar groups but higher than in L.serriola, suggesting that domestication lead to bacterial diversification in lettuce root system. Spearman correlations between operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed that co-occurrence prevailed over co-exclusion, and complementary fluorescence in situ hybridization-confocal laser scanning microscopy (FISH-CLSM) analyses revealed that this pattern results from both potential interactions and habitat sharing. Predominant taxa, such as Pseudomonas, Flavobacterium and Sphingomonadaceae rather suggested interactions, even though these are not necessarily part of significant modules in the co-occurrence networks. Without any need for complex interactions, single organisms are able to invade into this microbial network and to colonize lettuce plants, a fact that can influence the susceptibility to pathogens. The approach to combine co-occurrence analysis and FISH-CLSM allows reliably reconstructing and interpreting microbial interaction networks. © 2014 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chloroflexi; Chloroflexi (class); Flavobacterium; Lactuca; Lactuca sativa; Lactuca serriola; Otus; Proteobacteria; Pseudomonas; Sphingomonadaceae; Bacteria; biodiversity; classification; genetics; isolation and purification; lettuce; microbial consortium; microbiology; microflora; organismal interaction; plant root; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Lettuce; Microbial Consortia; Microbial Interactions; Microbiota; Plant Roots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921877062

We evaluated the processes that drive spatial patterns in oyster recruitment by comparing observed recruitment, simulated hydrodynamic connectivity and ecological variables. We hypothesized that spatial variability of recruitment depends on (1) hydrodynamic connectivity and (2) the ecology of the larval supply, settlement, metamorphosis, survival and biotic environmental parameters. We assessed recruitment at 6-8 experimental sites by larval sampling and spat collection inside and outside oyster farming areas and on an east-west gradient, from 2012-2014. Hydro dyna - mic connectivity was simulated using a numerical 3D transport model assessed with a Eulerian indicator. The supply of large umbo larvae did not differ significantly inside and outside oyster farming areas, whereas the supply of pediveligers to sites outside shellfish farms was structured by hydrodynamic connectivity. Inside shellfish farming zones, unfavorable conditions due to trophic competition with filter-feeders jeopardized their settlement. In this case, our results suggest loss of settlement competence by oyster larvae. This confirms our hypo thesis of top-down trophic control by the oysters inside farming zones of Thau lagoon in summer that fails to meet the ecological requirements of these areas as oyster nurseries. Knowledge of oyster dispersal, connectivity and recruitment in coastal lagoons will help local development of sustainable natural spat collection. On a global scale, our method could be transposed to other basins or used for other species such as mussels, clams or scallops, to better understand the spatial patterns of bivalve recruitment. Management of the oyster industry based on natural spat collection will help develop a sustainable activity, based on locally adapted oyster strains but also by reducing the risks of transferring pathogens between basins and the global carbon footprint of this industry. © Inter-Research 2019.","Coastal lagoon; Connectivity; Crassostrea gigas; Larval ecology; Oligotrophication; Recruitment; Settlement; Spatial patterns","bivalve; coastal lagoon; connectivity; dispersal; environmental factor; hydrodynamics; larval settlement; metamorphosis; oligotrophic environment; recruitment (population dynamics); sampling; shellfish fishery; spatial variation; survival; trophic structure; Bivalvia; Crassostrea gigas; Magallana; Ostreidae; Pectinidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076414791

However, it remains a challenge to explain what social complexity exactly is and what the best corresponding measures of brain anatomy are. Absolute and relative size of the brain and of the neocortex have often been used as a proxy to predict cognitive performance. Here, we apply the logic of the social brain hypothesis to marine cleaning mutualism involving the genus Labroides. These wrasses remove ectoparasites from 'client' reef fish. Conflict occurs as wrasse prefer client mucus over ectoparasites, where mucus feeding constitutes cheating. As a result of this conflict, cleaner wrasse show remarkable Machiavellian-like behaviour. Using own data as well as available data from the literature, we investigated whether the general brain anatomy of Labroides provides any indication that their Machiavellian behaviour is associated with a more complex brain. Neither data set provided evidence for an increased encephalisation index compared to other wrasse species. Published data on relative sizes of brain parts in 25 species of the order Perciformes suggests that only the diencephalon is relatively enlarged in Labroides dimidiatus. This part contains various nuclei of the social decision making network. In conclusion, gross brain anatomy yields little evidence for the hypothesis that strategic behaviour in cleaning selects for larger brains, while future research should focus on more detailed aspects like the sizes of specific nuclei as well as their cryoarchitectonic structure and connectivity.

Establishment of artificial catchments to augment natural water sources for target species other than amphibians (e.g., larger-bodied and more-vagile game species) can increase connectivity between potential breeding sites and populations of amphibians. These anthropogenic waters, however, may differ in quality from natural waters, with ammonia concentrations high enough to potentially affect amphibian health, reproduction, and population persistence. Thus, water supplementation has set up a potential conflict for managing landscape connectivity for sympatric species differing in dispersal abilities. To explore this possibility, we used graph theory to examine potential connectivity under current and potential future scenarios among natural, modified natural, and human-made waters on the United States Air Force's Barry M. Goldwater Range East (BMGR-E) and adjacent Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in Arizona. The network of 117 waterbodies on the study site (82 natural and unmodified, 35 anthropogenic or modified) coalesced at 15.7 km, meaning that wildlife must be capable of traveling ≥15.7 km from any water to the next to traverse the network, assuming all the waterbodies are in fact wet. At this threshold dispersal distance, we identified those waters that played important linkage roles in supporting connectivity through the network, 23% (5 of 22) of which were found to be either anthropogenic or modified waters, indicating that human activities play an outsized role in countering natural isolation of the waters. Two of these important waters were hubs (i.e., waters linked to a high number of nearby wetlands), meaning that the potential negative factors in a catchment could affect relatively more wildlife than in waters not associated with a hub. Because the coalescence distance exceeded the dispersal range of many smaller-bodied species, we also examined 2 smaller dispersal distances more appropriate for smaller-bodied and less-vagile species like amphibians (0.6 km and 6 km). We identified 2 wetland clusters that contained anthropogenic or modified waters. When we performed simulated removal of catchments (representing potential management action), the network showed surprisingly few effects: coalescence distance did not increase, and although the number of wetland clusters changed slightly, wetland density in the majority of clusters was not reduced. These results suggest that catchments could be removed without much negative impact on larger, high-vagility (i.e., those capable of dispersing ≥15.7 km; large mammals) or smaller, low-vagility (e.g., amphibians) species. Simulated removal of waters allowed us to generate a prioritized list of waters found to be consistently important for connectivity conservation for wildlife (large and small) on BMGR-E and adjacent BLM lands. Such an approach could be adopted in any situation where a quantitative assessment of connectivity among habitat patches and management options is needed. © The Wildlife Society, 2016.","amphibian; catchment; connectivity; graph theory; network; wildlife water","amphibian; artificial ecosystem; breeding site; catchment; connectivity; desert; dispersal; graphical method; human activity; water quality; wildlife management; Arizona; United States; Amphibia; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84961266988

Location: New Zealand. Methods: We used a three-pronged approach based on 17 microsatellites, two mitochondrial loci (cytochrome b/control region) and phenotypic data (head-bill length, bill depth, wing length, weight). We determined large-scale genetic structure throughout the whole breeding range (approx. 150,000 km2), calculated genetic divergence of breeding colonies and tested for isolation-by-distance between colonies. We investigated the level of fine-scale genetic structure based on spatial autocorrelation analyses and assessed the presence of a body size cline based on phenotypic data. Lastly, we compared phenotypic divergence (PST) and the level of divergence by genetic drift (FST) among breeding colonies to test for underlying mechanisms of population differentiation. Results: Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA showed that across their range black-fronted terns were effectively panmictic, with low genetic divergence between breeding colonies overall and no isolation-by-distance. However, at fine geographical scales black-fronted terns accrued significant genetic structure for distances up to 75 km, primarily driven by males, indicating more frequent female dispersal. Furthermore, a phenotypic cline in accordance with Bergmann's rule was evident. PST exceeded FST in three traits, suggestive of local adaptation. Main conclusions: Significant fine-scale structure can be present in highly mobile, specialist species while not affecting spatial structures at larger scales. Hence, methodologies applied to both whole landscapes and local scales are important to appropriately estimate connectivity in dynamic metapopulations and investigate the processes behind connectivity. Conservation management will need to include protecting currently uninhabited patches to facilitate natural colonization of suitable habitat. For black-fronted terns, managing whole catchments throughout the entire breeding range would be preferable to managing single patches. © 2019 The Authors.

W., Lynnwood, WA 98036, United States","A substantial shift toward use of marine protected areas (MPAs) for conservation and fisheries management is currently underway. This shift to explicit spatial management presents new challenges and uncertainties for ecologists and resource managers. In particular, the potential for MPAs to change population sustainability, fishery yield, and ecosystem properties depends on the poorly understood consequences of three critical forms of connectivity over space: larval dispersal, juvenile and adult swimming, and movement of fishermen. Conventional fishery management describes the dynamics and current status of fish populations, with increasing recent emphasis on sustainability, often through reference points that reflect individual replacement. These compare lifetime egg production (LEP) to a critical replacement threshold (CRT) whose value is uncertain. Sustainability of spatially distributed populations also depends on individual replacement, but through all possible paths created by larval dispersal and LEP at each location. Model calculations of spatial replacement considering larval connectivity alone indicate sustainability and yield depend on species dispersal distance and the distribution of LEP created by species habitat distribution and fishing mortality. Adding MPAs creates areas with high LEP, increasing sustainability, but not necessarily yield. Generally, short distance dispersers will persist in almost all MPAs, while sustainability of long distance dispersers requires a specific density of MPAs along the coast. The value of that density also depends on the uncertain CRT, as well as fishing rate. MPAs can increase yield in areas with previously low LEP but for short distance dispersers, high yields will require many small MPAs. The paucity of information on larval dispersal distances, especially in cases with strong advection, renders these projections uncertain. Adding juvenile and adult movement to these calculations reduces LEP near the edges in MPAs, if movement is within a home-range, but more broadly over space if movement is diffusive. Adding movement of fishermen shifts effort on the basis of anticipated revenues and fishing costs, leading to lower LEP near ports, for example. Our evolving understanding of connectivity in spatial management could form the basis for a new, spatially oriented replacement reference point for sustainability, with associated new uncertainties. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.","Connectivity; Dispersal; Fisheries management; Home range; Marine reserve; Metapopulation","conservation management; ecosystem management; egg production; fishery management; home range; marine park; metapopulation; mortality; population distribution; population dynamics; sustainability; yield response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-59649096232

Very recently some of these models have allowed both the predictors and their coefficients to be time-dependent. However, these studies mainly focused on predictors that are assumed to be constant through time. Here we inferred the phylodynamics of avian influenza A virus H9N2 isolated in 12 Asian countries and regions under both discrete trait analysis (DTA) and structured coalescent (MASCOT) approaches. Using MASCOT we applied a new time-dependent GLM to uncover the underlying factors behind H9N2 spread. We curated a rich set of time-series predictors including annual international live poultry trade and national poultry production figures. This time-dependent phylodynamic prediction model was compared to commonly employed time-independent alternatives. Additionally the time-dependent MASCOT model allowed for the estimation of viral effective sub-population sizes and their changes through time, and these effective population dynamics within each country were predicted by a GLM. International annual poultry trade is a strongly supported predictor of virus migration rates. There was also strong support for geographic proximity as a predictor of migration rate in all GLMs investigated. In time-dependent MASCOT models, national poultry production was also identified as a predictor of virus genetic diversity through time and this signal was obvious in mainland China. Our application of a recently introduced time-dependent GLM predictors integrated rich time-series data in Bayesian phylodynamic prediction. We demonstrated the contribution of poultry trade and geographic proximity (potentially unheralded wild bird movements) to avian influenza spread in Asia. To gain a better understanding of the drivers of H9N2 spread, we suggest increased surveillance of the H9N2 virus in countries that are currently under-sampled as well as in wild bird populations in the most affected countries. © 2019 Yang et al.

Further studies have shown more generally that the LALs are crucial both for an insect's ability to steer correctly and for organising the outputs of the descending pathways towards the motor centres. In this context, we propose a framework by which the LALs may be generally involved in generating steering commands across a variety of insects and behaviours. Across different behaviours, we see that the LAL is involved in generating two kinds of steering: (1) search behaviours and (2) targeted steering driven by direct sensory information. Search behaviours are generated when the current behaviourally relevant cues are not available, and a well-described LAL subnetwork produces activity which increases sampling of the environment. We propose that, when behaviourally relevant cues are available, the LALs may integrate orientation information from several sensory modalities, thus leading to a collective output for steering driven by those cues. These steering commands are then sent to the motor centres, and an additional efference copy is sent back to the orientation-computing areas. In summary, we have taken known aspects of the neurophysiology and function of the insect LALs and generated a speculative framework that suggests how LALs might be involved in steering control for a variety of complex real-world behaviours in insects. © 2020.

In sensorimotor tasks resembling navigational performance, the serial order of objects is intimately connected with spatial order. Mammals and birds develop episodic(-like) memory in serial spatio-temporal tasks, and the honeybee learns spatio-temporal order when navigating between the nest and a food source. Here I examine the structure of the bees' memory for a combined spatio-temporal task. I ask whether discrimination and generalization are based solely on simple forms of stimulus-reward learning or whether they require sequential configurations. Animals were trained to fly either left or right in a continuous T-maze. The correct choice was signaled by the sequence of colors (blue, yellow) at four positions in the access arm. If only one of the possible 4 signals is shown (either blue or yellow), the rank order of position salience is 1, 2 and 3 (numbered from T-junction). No learning is found if the signal appears at position 4. If two signals are shown, differences at positions 1 and 2 are learned best, those at position 3 at a low level, and those at position 4 not at all. If three or more signals are shown these results are corroborated. This salience rank order again appeared in transfer tests, but additional configural phenomena emerged. Most of the results can be explained with a simple model based on the assumption that the four positions are equipped with different salience scores and that these add up independently. However, deviations from the model are interpreted by assuming stimulus configuration of sequential patterns. It is concluded that, under the conditions chosen, bees rely most strongly on memories developed during simple forms of associative reward learning, but memories of configural serial patterns contribute, too. © 2009 Menzel.",,"animal experiment; article; color discrimination; episodic memory; honeybee; maze test; nonhuman; sensory memory; sequential analysis; state dependent learning; stimulus response; task performance; animal; bee; learning; physiology; Animalia; Apis mellifera; Apoidea; Aves; Mammalia; Animals; Bees; Learning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61849121862

The role of hedgerows in maintaining biodiversity is well established, but few studies have addressed the importance for biodiversity of the intrinsic characteristics of hedgerows and the quality of hedgerow networks along a spatial scale. We examined three quality indices providing information at different territorial levels: density in the landscape, structural diversity and wood production. We performed an acoustic survey in a grassland to estimate the species abundance and community composition of bats (taxa) and bush crickets (11 species). Using an approach based on species and traits, we assessed how hedgerow quality influenced the activity of these taxa at different spatial scales (from 50 to 1000 m) and focused on three types of traits: bush cricket mobility ability, bat foraging strategy and habitat specialization. In general, our results showed the importance of hedgerow quality for bats and bush crickets, but the strength of the association between taxa and hedgerows varied substantially among the species and the spatial scales. Although it depends on the taxa, the production, density and structural diversity of hedgerows each had an overall positive effect. Our results suggested that these effects were generally more important at large scales. The scale effect of the production index is the best predictor of activity for bat and bush cricket taxa and traits. Our results showed the importance of hedgerow quality for the ecology of bat and bush cricket communities and could be used to improve conservation management. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.","Acoustic monitoring; Chiroptera; Conservation; Hedgerows; Orthoptera; Scale effect","abundance; acoustic survey; bat; biodiversity; community composition; cricket; grassland; habitat fragmentation; hedgerow; scale effect; taxonomy; Chiroptera; Orthoptera; Tettigoniidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957928564

In ambrosia beetles, female offspring temporarily remain in their natal nest and refrain from reproduction, instead investing in alloparental care. Previous work has demonstrated a link between helping behaviour and the increased need for pathogen defence, arising from their close association with fungal cultivars. In the ambrosia beetle Xyleborinus saxesenii, mature female offspring can effectively fight pathogen infections and manage the microbial composition within the nest by adjusting the frequency of different hygienic and nest maintenance behaviours. This suggests a potential to respond flexibly to the ecology of their nest, which calls for a better understanding of the connection between behaviour and the microbial community thriving within their nests. Here, we studied the significance of the mutualistic fungus garden composition for the beetles’ nest ecology and fitness by experimentally varying substrate quality. We found that the vertically transmitted ambrosia fungus garden is composed of at least two fungus mutualist species and a wide variety of other microbes varying in their relative abundance. This is strongly affected by the moisture content of the substrate, which in nature depends on the age and type of wood. We found that the mutualist fungi complement each other in terms of dryness-resistance, allowing the beetles to utilise a broad range of substrates over prolonged time during which the wood gradually desiccates. Under suboptimal humidity conditions, the interaction between host and multiple fungus species has important ramifications for the behaviour of philopatric helpers, including their alloparental investment, sibling cannibalism and the timing of dispersal. Rearing five generations of beetles consecutively in dry substrate resulted in transgenerational effects on philopatry and alloparental care, probably mediated through the dominance of a particular fungus species that was driven by the experimental habitat condition. Interestingly, the nests of these selection lines produced much more offspring after five generations than any first-generation nest, which may have reflected increased egg laying by non-dispersing daughters. Our study highlights the importance of considering the interactions between the microbial community and their insect hosts for understanding social evolution in cooperatively breeding beetles. © Copyright © 2021 Nuotclà, Diehl and Taborsky.","ambrosia beetles; cooperation; cooperative breeding; dispersal; habitat quality; insect-fungus mutualism; social evolution; Xyleborinus saxesenii",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105963459

However, spatial heterogeneity in the intensity of genetic drift, stemming from variations in population sizes, may inflate variance in measures of genetic differentiation and lead to erroneous or incomplete interpretations in terms of connectivity. Here, we tested the efficiency of two distance-based metrics designed to capture the unique influence of spatial heterogeneity in local drift on genetic differentiation. These metrics are easily computed from estimates of effective population sizes or from environmental proxies for local carrying capacities, and allow us to introduce the hypothesis of Spatial-Heterogeneity-in-Effective-Population-Sizes (SHNe). SHNe can be tested in a way similar to isolation-by-distance or isolation-by-resistance within the classical landscape genetics hypothesis-testing framework. We used simulations under various models of population structure to investigate the reliability of these metrics to quantify the unique contribution of SHNe in explaining patterns of genetic differentiation. We then applied these metrics to an empirical genetic dataset obtained for a freshwater fish (Gobio occitaniae). Simulations showed that SHNe explained up to 60% of variance in genetic differentiation (measured as Fst) in the absence of gene flow, and up to 20% when migration rates were as high as 0.10. Furthermore, one of the two metrics was particularly robust to uncertainty in the estimation of effective population sizes (or proxies for carrying capacity). In the empirical dataset, the effect of SHNe on spatial patterns of Fst was five times higher than that of isolation-by-distance, uniquely contributing to 41% of variance in pairwise Fst. Taking the influence of SHNe into account also allowed decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the upper estimate of effective dispersal distance. We conclude that the use of SHNe metrics in landscape genetics will substantially improve the understanding of evolutionary drivers of genetic variation, providing substantial information as to the actual drivers of patterns of genetic differentiation in addition to traditional measures of Euclidean distance or landscape resistance. © 2017 The Authors.

Here, we derived a sizebased, spatially explicit, stochastic demographic model to explore how different spatial configurations of MR networks can affect abundance and commercial yield of the green abalone (Haliotis fulgens), taking as a reference case the abalone fishery of Isla Natividad in Baja California Sur (Mexico). Our analysis suggests that a network of MRs can have a positive effect on abalone population abundance and a slightly negative effect on fishery output with respect to traditional maximum sustainable yield (MSY; i.e., with no reserves). Simulations show that maximum catches achievable with MRs are, under the best configuration, [1]2%–14% lower than traditional MSY depending on the total fraction of the fishing grounds protected. In the case of overexploitation, long-term yields can increase following the implementation of MRs. In addition, in the presence of MRs, abundances and yields are much less sensitive to systematic errors in the enforcement of the optimal harvesting rate compared with situations in which MRs are not present. Given the limited dispersal ability of the species, the best outcomes in terms of fishery output would be achieved with very small reserves—around 100 m wide—so to maximize larval export in the fishable areas. Our results indicate appropriately designed MR networks are an effective strategy for meeting both conservation and economic goals under uncertainty. While the size of the existing reserves in Isla Natividad seems adequate to protect the abalone stock, smaller reserves could maximize fishery benefits, although this poses challenges for enforcement. ©, 2015, National Research Council of Canada.

Of these, reviewing studies on stream fish habitat is the primary objective of this paper. Streams in Japan have widely received severe habitat alterations through construction of artificial instream structures as well as modification of riparian vegetations. As a result, streamdwelling fishes that require natural flow regimes, substrates, and riparian vegetation have declined their populations in great deal in many parts of the country. Recent studies have found riparian forests control water temperature and provide woody debris creating cover structures for the stream fishes resulting in enhancing their carrying capacity. Differences in riparian vegetation types (forest versus grass) played an important role in determining the local distribution of salmonids. Also, experiments removing concrete-lined channel and installing log-drop structures demonstrated that such the treatment greatly improved fish habitat. As the general public became aware of the serious degradation of aquatic habitats, river management policy has gradually shifted to include conservation and improvement of river environment as habitat for wildlife during the last two decades. For fish migration, installation of fishway on dams has been prevailing, and research efforts have been made to design more effective fishway and passable weirs. In many cases, however, such restoration work lacks ecological data for assessment of their effectiveness. When such knowledge on fish habitat are accumulated, a vital issue will be how it is accounted into actual management. Future studies on fish habitat should shift toward treating habitat network at larger spatial scales to seek better designs for distributing appropriate habitats over a whole catchment. Such studies should also include clarifying the habitat requirements of endangered species and effects of non-native on native species. © 2001, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

We used surf zones of exposed sandy beaches in eastern Australia as a model seascape to test for combined effects of coastal urbanization and seascape connectivity (i.e. spatial links between surf zones, estuaries and rocky headlands) on fish assemblages. Location: Four hundred kilometres of exposed surf beaches along the eastern coastline of Australia. Methods: Fish assemblages were surveyed from surf zones of 14 ocean-exposed sandy beaches using purpose-built surf baited remote underwater video stations. Results: The degree of coastal urbanization and connectivity were strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of fish species richness and abundance and were of greater importance to surf fishes than local surf conditions. Urbanization was associated with reductions in the abundance of harvested piscivores and fish species richness. Piscivore abundance and species richness were lowest on highly urbanized coastlines, and adjacent to beaches in wilderness areas where recreational fishing is intense. By contrast, seascape connectivity was correlated with the spatial distribution of omnivore and planktivore abundance. Spatial linkages between surf zones and estuaries were also important to two globally threatened guitarfish that are of international conservation significance. Main conclusions: We show for the first time how vulnerable and iconic fish species in surf zones are affected by the presence of coastal cities and the attributes of seascapes in which these cities are embedded. It is possible that greater connectivity may lessen ‘urbanization’ impacts for species with broad diets and strong ecological links to other ecosystems – this offers new perspectives in coastal conservation, for fishes and beyond. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","coastal management; disturbance; estuaries; landscape ecology; surf zones","abundance; beach; coastal protection; coastal zone management; connectivity; disturbance; estuarine environment; fish; landscape ecology; recreational activity; spatial distribution; species richness; surf zone; urbanization; Australia; Animalia; Pisces; Rhinobatidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994171989

Roads have consistently been implicated as drivers of ongoing Amazon deforestation and may act as corridors to facilitate species invasions. Long-term data, however, are necessary to determine how ecological succession alters avian communities following deforestation and whether established roads lead to a constant influx of new species. We used data across nearly 40 years from a large-scale deforestation experiment in the central Amazon to examine the avian colonization process in a spatial and temporal framework, considering the role that roads may play in facilitating colonization. Since 1979, 139 species that are not part of the original forest avifauna have been recorded, including more secondary forest species than expected based on the regional species pool. Among the 35 species considered to have colonized and become established, a disproportionate number were secondary forest birds (63%), almost all of which first appeared during the 1980s. These new residents comprise about 13% of the current community of permanent residents. Widespread generalists associated with secondary forest colonized quickly following deforestation, with few new species added after the first decade, despite a stable road connection. Few species associated with riverine forest or specialized habitats colonized, despite road connection to their preferred source habitat. Colonizing species remained restricted to anthropogenic habitats and did not infiltrate old-growth forests nor displace forest birds. Deforestation and expansion of road networks into terra firme rainforest will continue to create degraded anthropogenic habitat. Even so, the initial pulse of colonization by nonprimary forest bird species was not the beginning of a protracted series of invasions in this study, and the process appears to be reversible by forest succession. © 2019 The Authors.

These problems are likely to intensify under future population growth and climate change scenarios. Scarce data on the distribution of freshwater fishes frequently limits the ability to assess the potential implications of an IBWT project on freshwater fish communities. Because connectivity in habitat networks is expected to be critical to species' biogeography, consideration of changes in the relative isolation of riverine networks may provide a strategy for controlling impacts of IBWTs on freshwater fish communities. Methods/Principal Findings: Using empirical data on the current patterns of freshwater fish biodiversity for rivers of peninsular India, we show here how the spatial changes alone under an archetypal IBWT project will (1) reduce freshwater fish biodiversity system-wide, (2) alter patterns of local species richness, (3) expand distributions of widespread species throughout peninsular rivers, and (4) decrease community richness by increasing inter-basin similarity (a mechanism for the observed decrease in biodiversity). Given the complexity of the IBWT, many paths to partial or full completion of the project are possible. We evaluate two strategies for step-wise implementation of the 11 canals, based on economic or ecological considerations. We find that for each step in the project, the impacts on freshwater fish communities are sensitive to which canal is added to the network. Conclusions/Significance: Importantly, ecological impacts can be reduced by associating the sequence in which canals are added to characteristics of the links, except for the case when all 11 canals are implemented simultaneously (at which point the sequence of canal addition is inconsequential). By identifying the fundamental relationship between the geometry of riverine networks and freshwater fish biodiversity, our results will aid in assessing impacts of IBWT projects and balancing ecosystem and societal demands for freshwater, even in cases where biodiversity data are limited.",,"fresh water; fresh water; article; biodiversity; biogeography; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; environmental protection; freshwater fish; India; interbasin water transfer; mathematical model; nonhuman; river; river ecosystem; riverine connectivity; species habitat; species richness; water management; water supply; animal; fish; physiology; river; theoretical model; water flow; Pisces; Animals; Biodiversity; Fishes; Fresh Water; Models, Theoretical; Rivers; Water Movements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859042550

In particular, the CPGs control the activity of motoneuron (MN) pools which drive the muscles of the individual legs and are thereby responsible for the generation of rhythmic leg movements. The rhythmic activity of the CPGs as well as their connectivity can be modified by the aforementioned sensory signals. However, the precise nature of the interaction between the CPGs and these sensory signals has remained generally largely unknown. Experimental methods aiming at finding out details of these interactions often apply cholinergic agonists such as pilocarpine in order to induce rhythmic activity in the CPGs. Using this general approach, we removed the influence of sensory signals and investigated the putative connections between CPGs controlling the upward/downward movement in the different legs of the stick insect. The experimental data, i.e. the measured MN activities, underwent connectivity analysis using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM). This method can uncover the underlying coupling structure and strength between pairs of segmental CPGs. For the analysis we set up different coupling schemes (models) for DCM and compared them using Bayesian Model Selection (BMS). Models with contralateral connections in each segment and ipsilateral connections on both sides, as well as the coupling from the meta- to the ipsilateral prothoracic ganglion were preferred by BMS to all other types of models tested.

As in many other epidemic systems, epidemic risk in seed systems often depends on the structure of networks of trade, social interactions, and landscape connectivity. In a case study, we evaluated the structure of an informal sweet potato seed system in the Gulu region of northern Uganda for its vulnerability to the spread of emerging epidemics and its utility for disseminating improved varieties. Seed transaction data were collected by surveying vine sellers weekly during the 2014 growing season. We combined data from these observed seed transactions with estimated dispersal risk based on village-to-village proximity to create a multilayer network or ""supranetwork."" Both the inverse power law function and negative exponential function, common models for dispersal kernels, were evaluated in a sensitivity analysis/uncertainty quantification across a range of parameters chosen to represent spread based on proximity in the landscape. In a set of simulation experiments, we modeled the introduction of a novel pathogen and evaluated the influence of spread parameters on the selection of villages for surveillance and management. We found that the starting position in the network was critical for epidemic progress and final epidemic outcomes, largely driven by node out-degree. The efficacy of node centrality measures was evaluated for utility in identifying villages in the network to manage and limit disease spread. Node degree often performed as well as other, more complicated centrality measures for the networks where village-to-village spread was modeled by the inverse power law, whereas betweenness centrality was often more effective for negative exponential dispersal. This analysis framework can be applied to provide recommendations for a wide variety of seed systems.

White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an introduced fungal disease that has spread rapidly throughout eastern North America, causing massive mortality in bat populations. We tested for a relationship between the population genetic structure of the most common host, the little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus), and the geographic spread of WNS to date by evaluating logistic regression models of WNS risk among hibernating colonies in eastern North America. We hypothesized that risk of WNS to susceptible host colonies should increase with both geographic proximity and genetic similarity, reflecting historical connectivity, to infected colonies. Consistent with this hypothesis, inclusion of genetic distance between infected and susceptible colonies significantly improved models of disease spread, capturing heterogeneity in the spatial expansion of WNS despite low levels of genetic differentiation among eastern populations. Expanding our genetic analysis to the continental range of little brown myotis reveals strongly contrasting patterns of population structure between eastern and western North America. Genetic structure increases markedly moving westward into the northern Great Plains, beyond the current distribution of WNS. In western North America, genetic differentiation of geographically proximate populations often exceeds levels observed across the entire eastern region, suggesting infrequent and/or locally restricted dispersal, and thus relatively limited opportunities for pathogen introduction in western North America. Taken together, our analyses suggest a possibly slower future rate of spread of the WNS pathogen, at least as mediated by little brown myotis. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","emerging infectious disease; fungal pathogen; population genetic structure; RAD-seq; white-nose syndrome","animal; bat; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; DNA sequence; genetics; geography; hibernation; microbiology; Mycoses; North America; nose; population dynamics; population genetics; theoretical model; veterinary; Animals; Chiroptera; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Genetics, Population; Geography; Hibernation; Models, Theoretical; Mycoses; North America; Nose; Population Dynamics; Sequence Analysis, DNA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84955209886

Moreover cerebellar pathologies have also been correlated with various emotional disorders such as depression and autism. Furthermore the same studies have shown that the integrity of the cerebellar vermis is necessary for the formation of new memory traces related to aversive stimuli. Fear is important because it may trigger a set of defensive reactions aimed at dealing with a threatening environment. For this reason fear responses have been evolutionarily conserved from fish to humans. Fear learning can be assessed using a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm. Here a neutral stimulus serves as conditioned stimulus (CS), and it is repeatedly associated with an aversive one, usually a foot-shock, called unconditioned stimulus (US). As a result of this pairing, the CS comes to elicit a set of spontaneous defensive responses that include freezing, increased heart rate, and startling. manipulation of the vermis affects these responses, and its reversible inactivation during the consolidation phase impairs fear memory. The neural correlate of cerebellar involvement in fear consolidation is provided by a behaviorally induced long-term increase of synaptic efficacy between parallel fibers and a Purkinje cell in the cerebellar cortex. This increase is specific of this synapse and it is not present in the climbing fiber synapse. In addition, in hotfoot mice, with a primary deficiency of parallel fiber to Purkinje cell synapse, short- and long-term fear memories are affected. Similar synaptic changes after fear conditioning are well documented in the amygdala and hippocampus, providing a link between emotional experiences and changes in neural activity. All these data support the idea that the cerebellum participates in fear learning. The functional interconnection of the vermis with hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus suggests a more complex role of the cerebellum as part of an integrated network regulating emotional behavior.","Cerebellum; Fear; Learning and memory; Synaptic plasticity","Hippocampus (fish); Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867984184

For individuals, populations and communities to persist in disturbed environments, they must have refuge from disturbance or disturbance must be minimal. Refugia convey spatial and temporal resistance or resilience in the face of disturbance, but the role of refugia in aquatic systems remains poorly understood. 2. We review available literature on aquatic refugia for fishes in order to synthesise current knowledge and provide suggestions for needed research. Our objectives were to clarify definitions of disturbance and refugia in the context of drought in aquatic systems, review how refuge habitats influence fish community structure, and consider the potential impact of refugia on fish population and community dynamics during drought. 3. Droughts cause a decrease in surface area/volume and an increase in extremes of physical and chemical water quality parameters. These conditions are linked with biotic interactions that structure the community of fishes residing in low-flow or dry season refugia by increasing mortality rates, decreasing birth rates and/or increasing migration rates. Many aquatic organisms seek refuge from disturbance and/or have adaptations (e.g. physiological tolerance) that provide refuge. 4. Drought in aquatic systems leads to shifts in refugia spacing and connectance at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Refuge size, disturbance intensity, and mobility of organisms is predicted to play a large role in population persistence. We expect that refuge habitats will experience net immigration during drying and net emigration after rewetting, with the opposite occurring in surrounding habitat patches. Population dynamics of fishes using refugia during drought are best modelled by modified source-sink dynamics, but dynamics are likely to change with spatial scale.","Disturbance; Drying; Fish movement; Patch dynamics; Refuge habitats; Scale","aquatic ecosystem; drought; fish; patch dynamics; population distribution; refuge; Pisces",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038575346

However, very few studies have analyzed these patterns across large portions of species' distributions. We compiled a large telemetry dataset on the globally endangered Egyptian Vulture Neophron percnopterus (94 individuals, 188 completed migratory journeys), tracked across ~70% of the species' global range, to analyze spatial and temporal variability of migratory movements within and among individuals and populations. We found high migratory connectivity at large spatial scales (i.e., different subpopulations showed little overlap in wintering areas), but very diffuse migratory connectivity within subpopulations, with wintering ranges up to 4,000 km apart for birds breeding in the same region and each subpopulation visiting up to 28 countries (44 in total). Additionally, Egyptian Vultures exhibited a high level of variability at the subpopulation level and flexibility at the individual level in basic migration parameters. Subpopulations differed significantly in travel distance and straightness of migratory movements, while differences in migration speed and duration differed as much between seasons and among individuals within subpopulations as between subpopulations. The total distances of the migrations completed by individuals from the Balkans and Caucasus were up to twice as long and less direct than those in Western Europe, and consequently were longer in duration, despite faster migration speeds. These differences appear to be largely attributable to more numerous and wider geographic barriers (water bodies) along the eastern flyway. We also found that adult spring migrations to Western Europe and the Balkans were longer and slower than fall migrations.

Location: Fifty-four communities along a c. 10,000 km latitudinal gradient across the Americas (39°N-32°S), ranging from sea level to c. 3700m a.s.l., located on the mainland and on islands and covering a wide range of climate regimes. Methods: We measured the level of specialization and modularity in mutualistic plant-hummingbird interaction networks. Using an ordinary least squares multimodel approach, we examined the influence of species richness, phylogenetic signal, insularity and current and historical climate conditions on network structure (null-model-corrected specialization and modularity). Results: Phylogenetically related species, especially plants, showed a tendency to interact with a similar array of mutualistic partners. The spatial variation in network structure exhibited a constant association with species phylogeny (R2=0.18-0.19); however, network structure showed the strongest association with species richness and environmental factors (R2=0.20-0.44 and R2=0.32-0.45, respectively). Specifically, higher levels of specialization and modularity were associated with species-rich communities and communities in which closely related hummingbirds visited distinct sets of flowering species. On the mainland, specialization was also associated with warmer temperatures and greater historical temperature stability. Main conclusions: Our results confirm the results of previous macroecological studies of interaction networks which have highlighted the importance of species richness and the environment in determining network structure. Additionally, for the first time, we report an association between network structure and species phylogenetic signal at a macroecological scale, indicating that high specialization and modularity are associated with high interspecific competition among closely related hummingbirds, subdividing the floral niche. This suggests a tighter co-evolutionary association between hummingbirds and their plants than in previously studied plant-bird mutualistic systems. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Community ecology, current climate; Historical climate; Hummingbird biogeography; Macroecology; Modularity; Phylogenetic signal; Pollination; Quantitative networks; Specialization","biogeography; bird; climate effect; coevolution; community ecology; interspecific competition; macroecology; mutualism; phylogenetics; plant-pollinator interaction; pollinator; specialization; species richness; Aves; Trochilidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943455290

Intricate distributions of species result in a reticulated structure of spatial associations. Species are geographically connected through sympatry links forming an overall natural network in biogeography. Spatial records are the signals that provide evidence to infer these sympatry links in the network. Punctual data are independent of a priori area determination. NAM is oriented to detect groups of species embedded into the global network that are internally sustained by sympatric cohesiveness but weakly connected (or disconnected) to outgroup entities. These groups, called units of co-occurrence (UCs), are segregated through the iterative removal of intermediary species according to their betweenness scores. Instances of analysis of the original NAM are improved through the following changes and extensions: (i) inference of weighted sympatry networks using new measures sensitive to the strength of overlap and topological resemblance between set of points; (ii) construction of a basal network discriminating major from minor sympatry associations; (iii) evaluation of the entire process of iterative removal of intermediary species for the selection of UCs found on different subnetworks; (iv) network partitioning based on the intrinsic cohesiveness of the UCs; (v) production of a graphical tool (cleavogram) depicting the structural changes of the network along the removal process. Improvements are tested using real and hypothetical data sets. Resolution of patterns is notably increased due to a more accurate recognition of allopatric patterns and the possibility of segregating spatially overlapped UCs. As in original NAM, spatial expressions of UCs are building blocks for biogeography supported by strictly endemic and connected species through sympatry paths. © 2011 The Author(s).","Clusters pattern recognition; cohesiveness; dot maps; NAM; spatial point process; sympatry","animal; article; biodiversity; biological model; classification; insect; methodology; New Zealand; phylogeography; species difference; Animals; Biodiversity; Insects; Models, Biological; New Zealand; Phylogeography; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857320868

It however remains unknown the degree to which such priorities are valid and reliable in the longer term, as subsequent habitat losses and other disruptions accumulate in the landscape. We compared the patch prioritizations and estimated connectivity losses resulting from individual patch removals and from a more exhaustive assessment accounting for the potentially synergistic impacts of multiple habitat losses by testing all possible combinations of patch removals. Habitat availability (reachability) metrics and metapopulation capacity were calculated in purposefully simulated landscapes and in habitat distribution data for three bird species (NE Spain). We found that 1) individual patch removals allowed identifying areas of low contribution to connectivity that remained so after subsequent network modifications, 2) the most important patches identified through individual removals often did not coincide with those patches whose removal would actually be most detrimental after multiple habitat losses. However, these differences were smaller for the habitat reachability metrics, as well as for very mobile species that were largely insensitive to habitat spatial arrangement. If many patch losses over time are likely, it might be a more robust and fruitful conservation strategy for managers to pinpoint those patches that, with a low negative impact on connectivity, can be converted to other land uses, instead of trying to elucidate through individual patch removals which subset of protected patches would be the most effective for conserving as much connectivity as possible in the long term. Individual patch removals provide useful but non-permanent guidelines that may need to be reassessed when substantial landscape modifications occur, which requires dynamic strategies for connectivity conservation in the face of global change. © 2014 The Authors.",,"assessment method; bird; connectivity; conservation management; global change; habitat availability; habitat conservation; habitat loss; landscape ecology; metapopulation; patch use; population distribution; prioritization; Spain; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928989503

However, the alteration of flow connectivity, degradation, and disruption of physical processes that sustain different levels of organisms (e.g., primary producers) are threats that affect aquatic biodiversity and the productivity of these habitats. Therefore, the large scale assessment of freshwater habitats for proactive water resources planning and the development of climate change mitigation and resource management strategies is essential. However, such monitoring and assessment is complicated by the inaccessibility of many large wetland systems during times of inundation, making in situ sampling unfeasible at a time when high levels of aquatic primary producers are generating food and energy sources for higher order consumers. To understand the physical dynamics of aquatic primary producers and freshwater habitats (1991–2019) during such times in a large floodplain river in northern Australia (Gilbert catchment), this study integrated Landsat-derived modified normalised difference water index and normalised difference vegetation index in a classification tree model. Thereafter, key hydrological drivers (rainfall and river discharge) of floodplain productivity and connectivity were assessed using a range of multivariate techniques. Results show that the floodplain had a high aquatic plant biomass during the summer wet season based on the correlation between aquatic biomass accumulation (hot spots) and inundation (r=0.83 @ phase lag < 1 month) during such period. River discharge (r=0.68 @ lag = 1 month) at downstream Gilbert catchment appear to be a relatively stronger indicator of hot spots of floodplain biomass accumulation as opposed to local rainfall (r=0.57 @ lag = 3 months). While the downstream discharge explains a significant proportion of variability in the leading orthogonal mode of rainfall (r=0.83), statistical relationships developed between discharge/rainfall and the distribution of aquatic primary producers confirm that both rivers (flow) and local rainfall are key optimal predictors of inundation and sites of primary producers with river flows being a better indicator of the latter. It is therefore argued that hydro-meteorological fluctuations will be key constraints on freshwater habitats and the growth of primary producers, albeit, human disturbance of flow can impact on floodplain productivity. As illustrated in this study, such constraints are reflected in the spatial patterns and changing characteristics (connectivity and spatial heterogeneity) of hot spots of primary producers and freshwater habitats (Palustrine, Lacustrine, and Riverine ecosystems). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aquatic vegetation; Classification tree; Floodplain; Image classification; Landsat; Macrophytes","Aquatic organisms; Banks (bodies of water); Biodiversity; Biomass; Catchments; Climate change; Ecosystems; Floods; Hydrogeology; Image classification; Productivity; Rain; Runoff; Vegetation; Water; Wetlands; Aquatic vegetation; Classification trees; Flood plains; LANDSAT; Macrophytes; Rivers; aquatic plant; biodiversity; catchment; climate change; disturbance; floodplain; freshwater environment; growth; image classification; Landsat; macrophyte; rainfall; river discharge; satellite data; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082742365

To address this problem, we use quantitative mass spectrometry to analyze dynamic effects of HER2 overexpression on phosphotyrosine signaling in human mammary epithelial cells stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) or heregulin (HRG). Data generated from this analysis reveal that EGF stimulation of HER2-overexpressing cells activates multiple signaling pathways to stimulate migration, whereas HRG stimulation of these cells results in amplification of a specific subset of the migration signaling network. Self-organizing map analysis of the phosphoproteomic data set permitted elucidation of network modules differentially regulated in HER2-overexpressing cells in comparison with parental cells for EGF and HRG treatment. Partial least-squares regression analysis of the same data set identified quantitative combinations of signals within the networks that strongly correlate with cell proliferation and migration measured under the same battery of conditions. Combining these modeling approaches enabled association of epidermal growth factor receptor family dimerization to activation of specific phosphorylation sites, which appear to most critically regulate proliferation and/or migration. © 2006 EMBO and Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","Cell migration; Cell proliferation; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Signal transduction; Tyrosine phosphorylation","epidermal growth factor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; neu differentiation factor; phosphotyrosine; unclassified drug; epidermal growth factor; epidermal growth factor receptor; hybrid protein; neu differentiation factor; phosphotyrosine; breast epithelium; cell function; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell stimulation; data analysis; dimerization; gene overexpression; human; mass spectrometry; partial least squares regression; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; proteomics; quantitative analysis; regulatory mechanism; review; self organizing map analysis; signal transduction; tumor growth; algorithm; article; biosynthesis; breast; cell division; cell line; cell motion; chemistry; comparative study; cytology; drug effect; epithelium cell; female; gene expression; genetics; metabolism; phosphorylation; physiology; protein processing; proto oncogene; regression analysis; validation study; Algorithms; Breast; Cell Division; Cell Line; Cell Movement; Dimerization; Epidermal Growth Factor; Epithelial Cells; Female; Gene Expression; Genes, erbB-1; Genes, erbB-2; Humans; Least-Squares Analysis; Mass Spectrometry; Neuregulin-1; Phosphorylation; Phosphotyrosine; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Receptor, erbB-2; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Signal Transduction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750696663

This study was undertaken to investigate both oxidative and hydrolytic stability of marine PL emulsions in relation to the chemical composition of the marine PL used. Moreover, non-enzymatic browning reactions were also investigated. Emulsions were prepared by high pressure homogenizer using different concentrations and sources of marine PL. In some formulations, fish oil was added in order to study the effect of increasing levels of triglycerides in the emulsions. The oxidative and hydrolytic stability of emulsions was investigated through measurement of peroxide value, free fatty acids, and 31P NMR during storage at 2 °C for up to 32 days. The oxidative stability of marine PL emulsions during storage was further investigated through the measurement of secondary volatile compounds by solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and dynamic headspace (DHS) connected to gas chromatography (GC-MS). Non-enzymatic browning reactions were investigated through the measurement of Strecker derived volatiles, colour changes and pyrrole content. The results suggested that the oxidative stability of marine PL emulsions was significantly influenced by the chemical composition and the concentration of marine PL used to prepare them. Emulsions with good oxidative stability could be prepared from marine PL of high purity and high content of PL and antioxidant and low TAG content. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

However, further loss and degradation of remaining wetland habitats might lead to a configuration and size of stopovers that is no longer sufficient to ensure long-term survival of waterbird populations. By identifying optimal conservation targets to maintain overall habitat availability en route, we can accommodate an as yet absent functional connectivity component in larger management frameworks for migratory waterbirds, such as the Ramsar Convention and the EU Natura 2000 Network. Using a graph-based habitat availability metric (Equivalent Connected Area) we determine the functional connectivity of wetland networks for seven migratory waterbirds with divergent habitat requirements. Analyses are performed at two spatial extents both spanning the Mediterranean Sea and centered around Greece (Balkan-Cyrenaica and Greece-Cyrenaica). We create species-specific suitable habitat maps and account for human disturbance by species-specific disturbance buffers, based on expert estimates of Flight Initiation Distances. At both spatial extents we quantitatively determine the habitat networks' overall functional connectivity and identify wetland sites that are crucial for maintaining a well-connected network. We show that the wetland networks for both spatial extents are relatively well connected and identify several wetland sites in Greece and Libya as important for maintaining connectivity. The application of disturbance buffers results in wetland site-specific reduction of suitable habitat area (0.90-7.36%) and an overall decrease of the network's connectivity (0.65-6.82%). In addition, we show that the habitat networks of a limited set of species can be combined into a single network which accounts for their autoecological requirements. We conclude that targeted management in few but specific wetland complexes could benefit migratory waterbird populations. Deterioration of these vital wetland sites in Greece and Libya will have disproportionate consequences to the waterbird populations they support.

Although comprising only a small fraction of the total area, semi-natural elements provide habitat for most of the landscape biodiversity. Agricultural intensification has increasingly fragmented semi-natural elements and species numbers are in decline. Insights into the effects of landscape structure on species' distributions within and among semi-natural habitats are needed to conserve biodiversity in agricultural landscapes more effectively. We investigated the landscape- and habitat-specific diversity partitions of wild bees, true bugs, and carabid beetles in two differently structured agricultural landscapes in Switzerland. In each landscape, we partitioned the total species diversity (γ) into its additive components within (αP) and among patches (βP) and among habitats (βH). In the landscape characterized by a patchy, isolated distribution of habitat elements, among-patch diversity (βP) explained 44% of the total species richness (γ) and was significantly higher than expected under a random distribution of samples among habitat patches; in the landscape with higher habitat connectivity, among-patch diversity (βP) comprised 32% of the total species richness (γ) and did not differ from the random expectation. Habitat-specific within-patch contributions to species richness were similarly low across habitat types (αP=23-24%) in the patchy landscape, whereas in the more connected landscape within-patch partitions tended to be higher and differed among habitat types (αP=22-38%). Functionally different groups of bees, true bugs, and carabids also responded differently to landscape structure in a manner that was consistent with known differences in resource specialization and dispersal ability. Differences in diversity partitions among landscapes and taxa indicate the need for flexible conservation strategies. Conservation of habitat-specific diversity may require more habitat patches in landscapes that have lower habitat connectivity and low within-patch diversity (αP) than in landscapes with higher within-patch diversity (αP). © 2007 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Additive partitioning; Agro-ecology; Alpha-; Bees; Beta-; Carabid beetles; Conservation; Dispersal limitation; Gamma-diversity; True bugs","Apoidea; Carabidae; Coleoptera; Heteroptera; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41949103752

Chipmunks represent a less flexible response, retaining their preference for wooded habitat. White-footed mice represent a more flexible, opportunistic response, expanding their use of the landscape to include corn and small-grain fields. Model parameters were derived from our field studies. The simulations followed chipmunk populations over 25 yr in 36 landscape patterns, each with a unique combination of amount of wooded habitat (10%, 30%, or 50% of the total area), subdivision of wooded habitat (2, 4, or 8 patches), and quality of connectivity (high, intermediate, low, or none). Mouse populations were simulated in 8 of these landscapes (30% wooded habitat, 4 patches at each level of connectivity, and 10% wooded habitat, 8 patches at each level of connectivity). Generalist mice outperformed specialist chipmunks in all subdivided landscapes in which they were compared. Since generalist mice were not restricted to woods and fencerows, all landscapes were highly connected for them and provided over 75% usable habitat. Survival rates for these mice were high in all landscape patterns. For opportunistic species able to use novel resources, landscape change may not be limiting. Connectivity was the best predictor of population persistence for specialist species that view the matrix as hostile. Chipmunk population survival was always greater in connected landscapes than in unconnected ones. Interactions of connectivity, composition and configuration were also important. Long survival times and low probabilities of extinction for chipmunk populations occurred in model landscapes with 30% or more woodland, and high and intermediate quality connectivity. Chipmunk populations in 8 patch landscapes with only 10% woodland and low connectivity had high extinction probabilities. Highly variable population size increased risk of extinction, especially when amount of wooded habitat was low. For behaviourally inflexible species, maintenance of habitat connectivity when habitat subdivision and accompanying habitat loss occur is vital to survival.",,"agricultural landscape; eastern chipmunk; landscape structure; modelling; population persistance; population size; white-fotted mouse; Peromyscus leucopus; Tamias striatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031952042

As an initial step in comparing the locomotor systems in lampreys, in larval animals the relative timing of locomotor movements and muscle burst activity were determined and compared to those previously published for adults. In addition, the kinematics for free swimming in larval and adult lampreys was compared in detail for the first time. First, for swimming in larval animals, the neuromechanical phase lag between the onsets or terminations of muscle burst activity and maximum concave curvature of the body increased with increasing distance along the body, similar to that previously shown in adults. Second, in larval lampreys, but not adults, absolute swimming speed (U;mms-1) increased with animal length (L). In contrast, normalized swimming speed (U’; body lengths [bl] s-1) did not increase with L in larval or adult animals. In both larval and adult lampreys, U’ and normalized wave speed (V’) increased with increasing tail-beat frequency. Wavelength and mechanical phase lag did not vary significantly with tail-beat frequency but were significantly different in larval and adult animals. Swimming in larval animals was characterized by a smaller U/V ratio, Froude efficiency, and Strouhal number than in adults, suggesting less efficient swimming for larval animals. In addition, during swimming in larval lampreys, normalized lateral headmovements were larger and normalized lateral tail movements were smaller than for adults. Finally, larval animals had proportionally smaller lateral surface areas of the caudal body and fin areas than adults. These differences are well suited for larval sea lampreys that spend most of the time buried in mud/sand, in which swimming efficiency is not critical, compared to adults that would experience significant selection pressure to evolve higher-efficiency swimming to catch up to and attach to fish for feeding as well as engage in long-distance migration during spawning. Finally, the differences in swim efficiency for larval and adult lampreys are compared to other animals employing the anguilliform mode of swimming. © 2016 by The University of Chicago.

For example, females of some insect species can submerge during oviposition, which may lead to sex-related adaptations in the hydrophobicity (water-repellency) due to specialization of certain morphological structures. On the other hand, ageing can cause changes in hydrophobicity of the surface, because the morphological structures can wear with age. Here, we investigated sex-and age-related differences in wing hydrophobicity and in morphology (spine density, wax cover characteristics, size of females' pseudopterostigma) potentially related to hydrophobicity of Calopteryx splendens damselflies. Hydrophobicity was measured with two methods, by measuring the contact angle (CA) between a wing and water droplet, and by dipping a wing into water and measuring forces needed to submerge, withdraw, and pull-out a wing from water. We found that C. splendens wings are superhydrophobic, having mean CAs of 161°. The only sex and age related difference in the hydrophobicity measurements was that young females had stronger amplitude of force fluctuations during withdrawal of wings from water than young males. This suggests that young females may form less uniform air pockets on their wings while submerged. From the morphological structures measured here, the only sex related finding was that old females had denser spine cover than young females in their wing veins. The difference may be explained by better survival of females with denser spine cover. The most important morphological character that predicted superhydrophobicity was the prevalence of long wax rods on wing veins. In addition, female pseudopterostigma area (a trait present only in females) was negatively related to pull-out force, suggesting that large pseudopterostigmas might help females to emerge from water following oviposition. The subtle sex-related differences in hydrophobicity could be explained by the fact that both sexes must resist rain, and males are occasionally in contact with water. © 2014 Kuitunen et al.",,"water; adaptation; aging; animal behavior; animal structures; article; Calopteryx splendens; contact angle; controlled study; cuticle; damselfly; egg laying; female; hydrophobicity; life cycle; male; morphology; nonhuman; scanning electron microscopy; sex difference; surface tension; wings; Aging; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cryoelectron Microscopy; Female; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Male; Nanostructures; Odonata; Sex Characteristics; Waxes; Wing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895755203

Computational models can be used as tools to extract the regulatory structure and dynamics of such networks from gene expression data. This approach is called reverse engineering. It has been successfully applied to many gene networks in various biological systems. However, to reconstitute the structure and non-linear dynamics of a developmental gene network in its spatial context remains a considerable challenge. Here, we address this challenge using a case study: the gap gene network involved in segment determination during early development of Drosophila melanogaster. A major problem for reverse-engineering pattern-forming networks is the significant amount of time and effort required to acquire and quantify spatial gene expression data. We have developed a simplified data processing pipeline that considerably increases the throughput of the method, but results in data of reduced accuracy compared to those previously used for gap gene network inference. We demonstrate that we can infer the correct network structure using our reduced data set, and investigate minimal data requirements for successful reverse engineering. Our results show that timing and position of expression domain boundaries are the crucial features for determining regulatory network structure from data, while it is less important to precisely measure expression levels. Based on this, we define minimal data requirements for gap gene network inference. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of reverse-engineering with much reduced experimental effort. This enables more widespread use of the method in different developmental contexts and organisms. Such systematic application of data-driven models to real-world networks has enormous potential. Only the quantitative investigation of a large number of developmental gene regulatory networks will allow us to discover whether there are rules or regularities governing development and evolution of complex multi-cellular organisms. © 2012 Crombach et al.",,"guanosine triphosphatase activating protein; article; complex formation; computer model; developmental gene; developmental stage; Drosophila melanogaster; embryo; embryo development; gap gene; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; gene structure; genetic conservation; genetic engineering; in situ hybridization; mathematical computing; mathematical model; nonhuman; protein expression; reverse genetics; Animals; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Gene Expression; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genes, Insect; Hybridization, Genetic; Models, Genetic; RNA, Messenger; Drosophila melanogaster",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864582232

Expression of storage proteins such as vitellogenins and hexamerins is an example of this co-option. Hexamerins, through their role modulating juvenile hormone availability, are involved in caste determination in termites. The genome of the fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) encodes four hexamerin genes, hexamerin-like (LOC105192919, hereafter called hexamerin 1), hexamerin (LOC105204474, hereafter called hexamerin 2), arylphorin subunit alpha-like, and arylphorin subunit beta. In this study, a phylogenetic analysis of the S. invicta hexamerins determined that each predicted protein clustered with one of the orthologous Apis mellifera hexamerins. Gene expression analyses by RT-qPCR revealed differential expression of the hexamerins between queens and workers, and between specific task-allocated workers (nurses and foragers). Queens and nurses had significantly higher expression of all genes when compared to foragers. Hexamerin 1 was expressed at higher levels in queens, while hexamerin 2 and arylphorin subunit beta were expressed at significantly higher levels in nurses. Arylphorin subunit alpha-like showed no significant difference in expression between virgin queens and nurses. Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between the expression of hexamerin genes and S-hydroprene, a juvenile hormone analog. Significant changes in hexamerin expression were recorded in nurses, virgin queens, and foragers 12 h after application of the analog. Hexamerin 1 and arylphorin subunit alpha-like expression were significantly lower after analog application in virgin queens. In foragers, hexamerin 2 and arylphorin subunit beta were significantly lower after analog application, while in nurses expression of all genes were significantly lower after analog application. Our results suggest that in S. invicta hexamerin genes could be associated with reproductive division of labor and task-allocation of workers. © This 2019 Hawkings et al.

In doing so, they allow one to identify influential nodes that are not well studied empirically so that future research can be prioritized. We identified relationships in host and pathogen biology to examine disease-driven declines of amphibians associated with amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). We constructed a Bayesian network consisting of behavioral, genetic, physiological, and environmental variables that influence disease and used them to predict host population trends. We varied the impacts of specific variables in the model to reveal factors with the most influence on host population trend. The behavior of the nodes (the way in which the variables probabilistically responded to changes in states of the parents, which are the nodes or variables that directly influenced them in the graphical model) was consistent with published results. The frog population had a 49% probability of decline when all states were set at their original values, and this probability increased when body temperatures were cold, the immune system was not suppressing infection, and the ambient environment was conducive to growth of B. dendrobatidis. These findings suggest the construction of our model reflected the complex relationships characteristic of host–pathogen interactions. Changes to climatic variables alone did not strongly influence the probability of population decline, which suggests that climate interacts with other factors such as the capacity of the frog immune system to suppress disease. Changes to the adaptive immune system and disease reservoirs had a large effect on the population trend, but there was little empirical information available for model construction. Our model inputs can be used as a base to examine other systems, and our results show that such analyses are useful tools for reviewing existing literature, identifying links poorly supported by evidence, and understanding complexities in emerging infectious-disease systems. © 2017 Society for Conservation Biology","Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Bayesian networks; chytridiomycosis; frog; fungus; hongo; parasitario; parasitic; pathogen; patógeno; quitridiomicósis; rana; redes Bayesianas; trópico húmedo; wet tropics","amphibian; Bayesian analysis; demographic trend; disease resistance; frog; fungal disease; fungus; host; host-pathogen interaction; humid tropics; immune system; parasitic disease; pathogen; Amphibia; Anura; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; Fungi; Lonchocarpus glaucifolius; altitude; animal; Bayes theorem; Chytridiomycetes; ecosystem; environmental protection; host pathogen interaction; immunology; innate immunity; microbiology; mycosis; physiology; population dynamics; Queensland; Ranidae; veterinary; Altitude; Animals; Bayes Theorem; Chytridiomycota; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Immunity, Innate; Mycoses; Population Dynamics; Queensland; Ranidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033467985

The gene network underlying wing polyphenism, however, is conserved in the winged castes of different ant species, but is interrupted at different points in the network in the wingless castes of these species. We previously constructed a mathematical model, which predicts that a key gene brinker (brk) mediates the development and evolution of these different ""interruption points"" in wingless castes of different ant species. According to this model, brk is upregulated throughout the vestigial wing discs of wingless ant castes to reduce growth and induce apoptosis. Here, we tested these predictions by examining the expression of brk, as well as three other genes up- and downstream of brk-decapentaplegic (dpp), spalt (sal), and engrailed (en)-in the winged reproductive and wingless soldier castes in the ant Pheidole morrisi. We show that expression of these genes is conserved in the wing disc of winged castes. Surprisingly, however, we found that brk expression is absent throughout development of the vestigial soldier forewing disc. This absence is correlated with abnormal growth of the soldier forewing disc as revealed by En expression and morphometric analyses. We also discovered that dpp and sal expression change dynamically during the transition from larval-to-prepupal development, and is spatiotemporally correlated with the induction of apoptosis in soldier forewing disc. Our results suggest that, contrary to our predictions, brk may not be a key gene in the network for suppressing wings in soldiers, and its absence may function to disrupt the normal growth of the soldier forewing disc. Furthermore, the dynamic changes in network interruptions we discovered may be important for the induction of apoptosis, and may be a general feature of gene networks that underlie polyphenism. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"ant; apoptosis; colony; environmental cue; gene expression; genetic analysis; growth rate; hypothesis testing; larva; life history trait; morphometry; numerical model; soldier caste; spatiotemporal analysis; wing morphology; amino acid sequence; animal; ant; apoptosis; article; biological model; forelimb; gene; gene expression; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; histology; metabolism; molecular genetics; phenotype; sequence homology; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Ants; Apoptosis; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genes, Insect; Genotype; Models, Biological; Molecular Sequence Data; Phenotype; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Wing; Formicidae; Pheidole morrisi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78049477352
