AB  - Increased risk of pathogen transmission through proximity and contact is a well-documented cost of sociality. Affiliative social contact, however, is an integral part of primate group life and can benefit health. Despite its importance to the evolution and maintenance of sociality, the tradeoff between costs and benefits of social contact for group-living primate species remains poorly understood. To improve our understanding of this interplay, we used social network analysis to investigate whether contact via association in the same space and/or physical contact measured through grooming were associated with helminth parasite species richness in a community of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii). We identified parasite taxa in 381 fecal samples from 36 individuals from the Kasekela community of chimpanzees in Gombe National Park, Tanzania, from November 1, 2006, to October 31, 2012. Over the study period, eight environmentally transmitted helminth taxa were identified. We quantified three network metrics for association and grooming contact, including degree strength, betweenness, and closeness. Our findings suggest that more gregarious individuals—those who spent more time with more individuals in the same space—had higher parasite richness, while the connections in the grooming network were not related to parasite richness. The expected parasite richness in individuals increased by 1.13 taxa (CI: 1.04, 1.22; p = 0.02) per one standard deviation increase in degree strength of association contact. The results of this study add to the understanding of the role that different types of social contact play in the parasite richness of group-living social primates. Significance statement: Parasite infections reveal costs of group living among wild animal populations. We studied the relationship between sociality and parasite transmission by assessing whether variation in social behavior among wild chimpanzees is associated with the number of unique helminth parasites detected in individual fecal samples. Our findings revealed that associating in the same shared space, but not grooming contact, is related to higher parasite richness. These findings improve our understanding of the complex interplay of parasitism and sociality with important implications for parasite transmission patterns in host species with flexible grouping patterns.

AB  - Animal social structure is shaped by environmental conditions, such as food availability. This is important as conditions are likely to change in the future and changes to social structure can have cascading ecological effects. Wood ants are a useful taxon for the study of the relationship between social structure and environmental conditions, as some populations form large nest networks and they are ecologically dominant in many northern hemisphere woodlands. Nest networks are formed when a colony inhabits more than one nest, known as polydomy. Polydomous colonies are composed of distinct sub‐colonies that inhabit spatially distinct nests and that share resources with each other.In this study, we performed a controlled experiment on 10 polydomous wood ant (Formica lugubris) colonies to test how changing the resource environment affects the social structure of a polydomous colony. We took network maps of all colonies for 5 years before the experiment to assess how the networks changes under natural conditions. After this period, we prevented ants from accessing an important food source for a year in five colonies and left the other five colonies undisturbed.We found that preventing access to an important food source causes polydomous wood ant colony networks to fragment into smaller components and begin foraging on previously unused food sources. These changes were not associated with a reduction in the growth of populations inhabiting individual nests (sub‐colonies), foundation of new nests or survival, when compared with control colonies.Colony splitting likely occurred as the availability of food in each nest changed causing sub‐colonies to change their inter‐nest connections. Consequently, our results demonstrate that polydomous colonies can adjust to environmental changes by altering their social network. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Organisms living in hot, arid environments face important risks associated with hyperthermia and dehydration which are expected to become more severe with climate change. To mitigate these risks, individuals often modify behaviour, e.g. reducing activity and seeking shade. These behavioural modifications may affect interactions between individuals, with consequences for the social structure of groups. We tested whether the social structure of cooperative groups of sociable weavers Philetairus socius varied with environmental temperature. We recorded the nature and frequency of interactions at feeders positioned beneath three sociable weaver colonies (n = 49 identified birds) in the Kalahari Desert with respect to environmental temperatures over a 30‐day period. Using random forest models, we examined whether thermal conditions predicted variation in social network structure. We also conducted focal observations of individual weavers to assess functional links between temperature, intensity of heat dissipation behaviour (panting) and immediate effects on social behaviour. Our results suggest that the social structure of weaver colonies becomes less cohesive and more fragmented at extreme and variable environmental temperatures. These changes in network structure appear to be linked with individuals' heat dissipation behaviour: extreme and variable temperatures were associated with increased panting, which was significantly correlated with an immediate reduction in the frequency of association. Collectively, our results indicate that interactions within groups could be disturbed by environmental temperature variation and extremes. Changing temperature regimes could therefore affect the functioning of animal societies by altering social networks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Experimental laboratory evidence suggests that animals with disrupted social systems express weakened relationship strengths and have more exclusive social associations, and that these changes have functional consequences. A key question is whether anthropogenic pressures have a similar impact on the social structure of wild animal communities.We addressed this question by constructing a social network from 6 years of systematically collected photographic capture–recapture data spanning 1,139 individual adult female Masai giraffes inhabiting a large, unfenced, heterogeneous landscape in northern Tanzania. We then used the social network to identify distinct social communities, and tested whether social or anthropogenic and other environmental factors predicted differences in social structure among these communities.We reveal that giraffes have a multilevel social structure. Local preferences in associations among individuals scale up to a number of distinct, but spatially overlapping, social communities, that can be viewed as a large interconnected metapopulation. We then find that communities that are closer to traditional compounds of Indigenous Masai people express weaker relationship strengths and the giraffes in these communities are more exclusive in their associations.The patterns we characterize in response to proximity to humans reflect the predictions of disrupted social systems. Near bomas, fuelwood cutting can reduce food resources, and groups of giraffes are more likely to encounter livestock and humans on foot, thus disrupting the social associations among group members. Our results suggest that human presence could potentially be playing an important role in determining the conservation future of this megaherbivore. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Individuals with high social rank within a dominance hierarchy often have priority access to resources relative to subordinate individuals, but these rank-dependent fitness effects may depend on the stability of the social hierarchy. Here we studied temporal changes in network structure and social relationships in experimentally perturbed social hierarchies of the cichlid Astatotilapia burtoni. By removing a dominant male in replicate groups, we triggered more status changes compared to control, subordinate male removal groups. At the individual level, we found that dominant male removal resulted in dominant males significantly increasing the rate of chases ('chase strength'), but there was no significant increase in the rate of display ('display strength'). Dominant male removal also led to several changes at the group level: network reciprocity and network stability decreased in response to dominant male removal, while network density was not affected by our treatment. However, in contrast to the individual level network measures, these group level effects were present in display networks but not in chase networks. Display networks mostly connect dominant males within the network, making display networks more sensitive to changes in the hierarchy. Together, our results provide novel insights into complex social dynamics in experimentally altered social dominance networks. • Cichlid fish form dominance hierarchies in which males fight for territories. • In groups of cichlid fish, we vacated a territory by removing a territorial male. • This created social instability and increased chase behaviour. • However, the instability was linked to changes in the display network only. • This is because display networks strongly connect territorial males in the network.

AB  - There is growing evidence that organisms can respond to declining population sizes by adapting their interactions with others. Regulating connections with others could underpin resilience of biological networks spanning from social groups to ecological communities. However, our ability to predict the dynamics of shrinking social networks remains limited.Network regulation involves several trade‐offs. Removing nodes (and therefore their connections) from networks reduces the number of connections among remaining nodes. Responding by forming new connections then impacts other network properties. A simple way to minimize the impact of up‐regulating network connections is to form new connections or to strengthen connections, between nodes that share a lost connection with a recently removed node.I propose a simple 'second‐degree rewiring' rule as a biologically plausible regulatory mechanism in shrinking social networks. I argue that two individuals that have lost a connection with a common removed individual will both be more likely, or more willing, to form a new, or strengthen an existing, connection among themselves. I then show that such second‐degree rewiring has less impact on important structural properties of the network than forming random new connections. For example, in a network with phenotypic assortment, second‐degree nodes are more likely to be similar than any random pair of nodes, and connecting these will better maintain assortativity. This simple rule can therefore maintain network properties without individuals having any knowledge of the global structure of the network or the relative properties of the nodes within it.In this paper, I outline an algorithm for second‐degree rewiring. I demonstrate how second‐degree rewiring can have less impact than adding new, or increasing the strength of, random connections on both the individual and whole network properties. That is, relative to randomly adding or strengthening connections, second‐degree rewiring has less impact on mean degree, assortativity, clustering and network density. I then demonstrate empirically, using social networks of great tits (Parus major), that individuals that previously shared connections to a removed conspecific were more likely to form a new connection or to strengthen their connection, relative to other individuals in the same population.This study highlights how developing a better mechanistic understanding of the structural properties of networks, and the consequences of adding new connections, can provide useful insights into how organisms are likely to regulate their interactions in shrinking populations.

AB  - The spatial organization of a population can influence the spread of information, behaviour and pathogens. Group territory size and territory overlap and components of spatial organization, provide key information as these metrics may be indicators of habitat quality, resource dispersion, contact rates and environmental risk (e.g. indirectly transmitted pathogens). Furthermore, sociality and behaviour can also shape space use, and subsequently, how space use and habitat quality together impact demography.Our study aims to identify factors shaping the spatial organization of wildlife populations and assess the impact of epizootics on space use. We further aim to explore the mechanisms by which disease perturbations could cause changes in spatial organization.Here we assessed the seasonal spatial organization of Serengeti lions and Yellowstone wolves at the group level. We use network analysis to describe spatial organization and connectivity of social groups. We then examine the factors predicting mean territory size and mean territory overlap for each population using generalized additive models.We demonstrate that lions and wolves were similar in that group‐level factors, such as number of groups and shaped spatial organization more than population‐level factors, such as population density. Factors shaping territory size were slightly different than factors shaping territory overlap; for example, wolf pack size was an important predictor of territory overlap, but not territory size. Lion spatial networks were more highly connected, while wolf spatial networks varied seasonally. We found that resource dispersion may be more important for driving territory size and overlap for wolves than for lions. Additionally, canine distemper epizootics may have altered lion spatial organization, highlighting the importance of including infectious disease epizootics in studies of behavioural and movement ecology.We provide insight about when we might expect to observe the impacts of resource dispersion, disease perturbations, and other ecological factors on spatial organization. Our work highlights the importance of monitoring and managing social carnivore populations at the group level. Future research should elucidate the complex relationships between demographics, social and spatial structure, abiotic and biotic conditions and pathogen infections. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Reintroductions, essential to many conservation programmes, disrupt both abiotic and social environments. Despite growing recognition that social connections in animals might alter survival (e.g. social transmission of foraging skills, or transmission of disease), there has thus far been little focus on the consequences of social disruption during reintroductions. Here we investigate if moving familiar social groups may help a threatened species to adjust to its new environment and increase post‐release survival. For a reintroduction of 40 juvenile hihi Notiomystis cincta (a threatened New Zealand passerine), we observed social groups before and after translocation to a new site and used social network analysis to study three levels of social change: overall group structure, network associations and individual sociality. We also tested alternate translocation strategies where birds were kept temporarily in aviaries in either a familiar group, or where their prior association was mixed. Although social structure remained similar among juveniles that remained at the source site, we detected significant changes in translocated birds at both the group‐ and individual‐ level post‐release. However, our holding treatments did not affect these social bonds so we remain unable to maintain or manipulate social groups during translocation. Crucially, there was a small tendency for translocated juveniles that gained more associates during re‐assortment of social groups to be more likely to survive their first year post‐release. We suggest that prior sociality may not be important during translocations, but rather individuals that are most able to adapt and form associations at a new site are most likely to be the surviving founders of reintroduced populations.

AB  - Social connectivity is important for measuring the fitness of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). While interactions in fission‐fusion societies vary between individuals, studies show that repeated interactions enhance reproduction and foraging success. Injuries that potentially remove an individual from its association network may disrupt these interactions. Using data from the long‐term resident dolphin community in Sarasota Bay, Florida, we investigated how anthropogenic injuries affect the dolphins' social associations by examining the differences before and after injury to individuals. We examined group size, strength, eigenvector centrality, clustering coefficient, and number of triangles and analyzed whether the animal's sex, age class, type of injury, or human intervention affected these values. We found that while group size did not change, injured dolphins had fewer preferred associates (HWI > 0.14) and were found in more fluid groups immediately after injury, but started returning to normal association levels after 2 years. This initial decrease in connectivity was not related to the age, sex, type of injury, or intervention. Despite the fluidity in individual associations, the strongest bonds remained stable, those between mothers and calves and those between male alliance partners. These findings provide some of the first information relating injuries and social networks for animals. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In animal societies with fission‐fusion dynamics, demographic disturbances can influence the social and spatial structure of the population. Within the Indian River Lagoon (IRL), Florida, common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) have experienced recurrent unusual mortality events (UMEs) providing an opportunity to examine postdisturbance population and social cluster restructuring. This study investigates the impact of the potentially nonepizootic 2008 UME on the IRL dolphin population. Photo‐identification surveys conducted from August 2006 to May 2010 were stratified into pre‐ (August 2006–April 2008) and post‐UME (September 2008–May 2010) time periods. Social network and spatial (univariate kernel density) analyses were limited to individuals sighted 5+ times per period (pre‐UME = 183, post‐UME = 134), and indicated a change from 11 to ten social clusters, although individuals did not always reassociate with pre‐UME cluster associates. Despite the social and spatial disconnect between IRL proper and Mosquito Lagoon clusters, both network density and core area spatial overlap increased post‐UME allowing for increased intercluster interactions. However, intracluster associations increased as well, allowing the population to maintain multiple social clusters within a loosely connected network. This study shows the important role sociality may play in the adaptability of cetaceans to environmental and demographic changes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The development of multilayer network techniques is a boon for researchers who wish to understand how different interaction layers might influence each other, and how these in turn might influence group dynamics. Here, we investigate how integration between male and female grooming and aggression interaction networks influences male power trajectories in vervet monkeys Chlorocebus pygerythrus. Our previous analyses of this phenomenon used a monolayer approach, and our aim here is to extend these analyses using a dynamic multilayer approach. To do so, we constructed a temporal series of male and female interaction layers. We then used a multivariate multilevel autoregression model to compare cross-lagged associations between a male's centrality in the female grooming layer and changes in male Elo ratings. Our results confirmed our original findings: changes in male centrality within the female grooming network were weakly but positively tied to changes in their Elo ratings. However, the multilayer network approach offered additional insights into this social process, identifying how changes in a male's centrality cascade through the other network layers. This dynamic view indicates that the changes in Elo ratings are likely to be short-lived, but that male centrality within the female network had a much stronger impact throughout the multilayer network as a whole, especially on reducing intermale aggression (i.e. aggression directed by males toward other males). We suggest that multilayer social network approaches can take advantage of increased amounts of social data that are more commonly collected these days, using a variety of methods. Such data are inherently multilevel and multilayered, and thus offer the ability to quantify more precisely the dynamics of animal social behaviors. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Compare two climate-sensitive Indigenous fisheries to generate broader insights. • Notice distinct changes but similar adaptive responses across case studies. • Diversification and adaptive co-management are common adaptive strategies. • Offer eight community resilience-building tactics (i.e., sources of resilience). • Named five definitive traits of a successful adaptation process. Climate change is having a significant influence on global fish production as well as on small-scale fishers' livelihoods, nutrition, and food security. We compared two climate-sensitive small-scale fisheries (SSFs) – an Inuit community in the Canadian Arctic and the Coastal-Vedda in Sri Lanka – to broaden our understanding of how fisheries-dependent Indigenous communities respond and adapt to climate change impacts. We used three steps to achieve this comparative study. To do this, we developed a resilience-based conceptual framework to empirically assess adaptations in two SSF communities, based on a literature review. Using the proposed framework and collecting qualitative field data over three years (2016–2019) to investigate how different remote SSFs experience and respond to climate change, we assessed Inuit and Coastal-Vedda case studies. The framework provided the structure for data analysis and conceptual guidance for two empirical assessments and the comparative analysis. Finally, we carried out the comparative analysis across the case studies using content analysis, identifying adaptive strategies, sources of resilience, and characteristics of successful adaptation. Additionally, we used discourse analysis to develop sources of resilience and characteristics of successful adaptation. Two key adaptive strategies emerged in common across the two communities – diversification and adaptive co-management. Eight sources of resilience that underpin adaptive capacity: i) use of diverse kinds of knowledge; ii) practice of different ways of learning; iii) use of community-based institutions; iv) efforts to improve human agency; v) unique worldviews; vi) specific cultural attributes that keep up with adaptation; vii) effective social networks; and viii) a high level of flexibility. Definitive characteristics that need to promote successful community adaptation: continuous learning through knowledge co-production; capacity-building to improve human agency; a place-specific nature (rootedness); collective action and partnerships through community-based institutions; and flexibility.

AB  - In most eusocial insects, the division of labor results in relatively few individuals foraging for the entire colony. Thus, the survival of the colony depends on its efficiency in meeting the nutritional needs of all its members. Here, we characterize the network topology of a eusocial insect to understand the role and centrality of each caste in this network during the process of food dissemination. We constructed trophallaxis networks from 34 food‐exchange experiments in black garden ants (Lasius niger). We tested the influence of brood and colony size on (i) global indices at the network level (i.e., efficiency, resilience, centralization, and modularity) and (ii) individual values (i.e., degree, strength, betweenness, and the clustering coefficient). Network resilience, the ratio between global efficiency and centralization, was stable with colony size but increased in the presence of broods, presumably in response to the nutritional needs of larvae. Individual metrics highlighted the major role of foragers in food dissemination. In addition, a hierarchical clustering analysis suggested that some domestics acted as intermediaries between foragers and other domestics. Networks appeared to be hierarchical rather than random or centralized exclusively around foragers. Finally, our results suggested that networks emerging from social insect interactions can improve group performance and thus colony fitness. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

After capturing adult female vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from a roost, we created "sick" bats by injecting a random half of bats with the immune-challenging substance, lipopolysaccharide, while the control group received saline injections. Over the next 3 days, we used proximity sensors to continuously track dyadic associations between 16 "sick" bats and 15 control bats under natural conditions. Compared to control bats, "sick" bats associated with fewer bats, spent less time near others, and were less socially connected to more well-connected individuals (sick bats had on average a lower degree, strength, and eigenvector centrality). High-resolution proximity data allow researchers to flexibly define network connections (association rates) based on how a particular pathogen is transmitted (e.g. contact duration of >1 vs. >60 min, contact proximity of <1 vs. <10 m). Therefore, we inspected how different ways of measuring association rates changed the observed effect of LPS. How researchers define association rates influences the magnitude and detectability of sickness effects on network centrality. When animals are sick, they often encounter fewer individuals. We tracked this unintentional "social distancing" effect hour-by-hour in a wild colony of vampire bats. Using bat-borne proximity sensors, we compared changes in the social network connectedness of immune-challenged "sick" bats versus "control" bats over time. "Sick" bats had fewer encounters with others and spent less time near others. Associations changed dramatically by time of day, and different measures of association influenced the sickness effect estimates. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A crucial property of circadian clocks is the ability to regulate the shape of an oscillation over its cycle length (waveform) appropriately, thus enhancing Darwinian fitness. Many studies over the past decade have revealed interesting ways in which the waveform of rodent behavior could be manipulated, one of which is that the activity bout bifurcates under environments that have 2 light/dark cycles within one 24-h day (LDLD). It has been observed that such unique, although unnatural, environments reveal acute changes in the circadian clock network. However, although adaptation of waveforms to different photoperiods is well studied, modulation of waveforms under LDLD has received relatively less attention in research on insect rhythms. Therefore, we undertook this study to ask the following questions: what is the extent of waveform plasticity that Drosophila melanogaster exhibits, and what are the neuronal underpinnings of such plasticity under LDLD? We found that the activity/rest rhythms of wild-type flies do not bifurcate under LDLD. Instead, they show similar but significantly different behavior from that under a long-day LD cycle. This behavior is accompanied by differences in the organization of the circadian neuronal network, which include changes in waveforms of a core clock component and an output molecule. In addition, to understand the functional significance of such variations in the waveform, we examined laboratory selected populations that exhibit divergent eclosion chronotypes (and therefore, waveforms). We found that populations selected for predominant eclosion in an evening window (late chronotypes) showed reduced amplitude plasticity and increased phase plasticity of activity/rest rhythms. This, we argue, is reflective of divergent evolution of circadian neuronal network organization in our laboratory selected flies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) result in hyperphagia and obesity and are the most common cause of monogenic obesity in humans. Preclinical rodent studies have determined that the critical role of the MC4R in controlling feeding can be mapped in part to its expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (paraventricular nucleus [PVN]), where it regulates the activity of anorexic neural circuits. Despite the critical role of PVN MC4R neurons in regulating feeding, the in vivo neuronal activity of these cells remains largely unstudied, and the network activity of PVN MC4R neurons has not been determined. Here, we utilize in vivo single-cell endomicroscopic and mathematical approaches to determine the activity and network dynamics of PVN MC4R neurons in response to changes in energy state and pharmacological manipulation of central melanocortin receptors. We determine that PVN MC4R neurons exhibit both quantitative and qualitative changes in response to fasting and refeeding. Pharmacological stimulation of MC4R with the therapeutic MC4R agonist setmelanotide rapidly increases basal PVN MC4R activity, while stimulation of melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R) inhibits PVN MC4R activity. Finally, we find that distinct PVN MC4R neuronal ensembles encode energy deficit and energy surfeit and that energy surfeit is associated with enhanced network connections within PVN MC4R neurons. These findings provide valuable insight into the neural dynamics underlying hunger and energy surfeit. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Mechanisms for fish social behaviours involve a social brain network (SBN) which is evolutionarily conserved among vertebrates. However, considerable diversity is observed in the actual behaviour patterns amongst nearly 30000 fish species. The huge variation found in socio‐sexual behaviours and strategies is likely generated by a morphologically and genetically well‐conserved small forebrain system. Hence, teleost fish provide a useful model to study the fundamental mechanisms underlying social brain functions. Herein we review the foundations underlying fish social behaviours including sensory, hormonal, molecular and neuroanatomical features. Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone neurons clearly play important roles, but the participation of vasotocin and isotocin is also highlighted. Genetic investigations of developing fish brain have revealed the molecular complexity of neural development of the SBN. In addition to straightforward social behaviours such as sex and aggression, new experiments have revealed higher order and unique phenomena such as social eavesdropping and social buffering in fish. Finally, observations interpreted as 'collective cognition' in fish can likely be explained by careful observation of sensory determinants and analyses using the dynamics of quantitative scaling. Understanding of the functions of the SBN in fish provide clues for understanding the origin and evolution of higher social functions in vertebrates. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Network analysis of infectious disease in wildlife can reveal traits or individuals critical to pathogen transmission and help inform disease management strategies. However, estimates of contact between animals are notoriously difficult to acquire. Researchers commonly use telemetry technologies to identify animal associations, but such data may have different sampling intervals and often captures a small subset of the population. The objectives of this study were to outline best practices for telemetry sampling in network studies of infectious disease by determining (a) the consequences of telemetry sampling on our ability to estimate network structure, (b) whether contact networks can be approximated using purely spatial contact definitions and (c) how wildlife spatial configurations may influence telemetry sampling requirements.We simulated individual movement trajectories for wildlife populations using a home range‐like movement model, creating full location datasets and corresponding 'complete' networks. To mimic telemetry data, we created 'sample' networks by subsampling the population (10%–100% of individuals) with a range of sampling intervals (every minute to every 3 days). We varied the definition of contact for sample networks, using either spatiotemporal or spatial overlap, and varied the spatial configuration of populations (random, lattice or clustered). To compare complete and sample networks, we calculated seven network metrics important for disease transmission and assessed mean ranked correlation coefficients and percent error between complete and sample network metrics.Telemetry sampling severely reduced our ability to calculate global node‐level network metrics, but had less impact on local and network‐level metrics. Even so, in populations with infrequent associations, high intensity telemetry sampling may still be necessary. Defining contact in terms of spatial overlap generally resulted in overly connected networks, but in some instances, could compensate for otherwise coarse telemetry data.By synthesizing movement and disease ecology with computational approaches, we characterized trade‐offs important for using wildlife telemetry data beyond ecological studies of individual movement, and found that careful use of telemetry data has the potential to inform network models. Thus, with informed application of telemetry data, we can make significant advances in leveraging its use for a better understanding and management of wildlife infectious disease.

AB  - Previous primate social network studies largely limited their focus to grooming and/or aggression networks, particularly among adult females. In addition, the consistency of individuals' network centrality across time and/or different networks has received little attention, despite this being critical for a global understanding of dynamic social structure. Here, we analyzed the grooming, aggression, and play social networks of a group of 26–28 wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), including adults and juveniles, over two periods of 6 months. We collected data on grooming, play, and aggression using focal animal sampling with instantaneous recording and ad libitum sampling. We examined whether individuals' network centralities were consistent over the two periods and across networks, as well as the effect of age, sex, and dominance rank on three individual centrality metrics in each network and within each study period. We found that individuals were quite consistent in their network position from 1 year to the next despite changes in group composition. However, their network centralities were not correlated across networks, except for Strength and weighted Eigenvector centrality between grooming and aggression networks. We also found that in the aggression network, high‐rankers showed the highest centrality in most network metrics (e.g., Degree, Strength, and Eigenvector centrality) and compared to males, females were most central in 2017 but not in 2018. In the grooming network, high‐ranking females had the highest Eigenvector centrality, whereas in the play network, juvenile males had the highest Eigenvector centrality. Our findings corroborate previous findings on vervet monkeys. In addition, they show that individuals' network centralities may vary among networks and over time; thus highlighting the effect of sociodemographics and behaviors' functions on the group level dynamics of social behavior. Highlights: In wild vervet monkeys, higher ranked animals were more central in aggression and grooming networks, and females were more central in aggression and grooming networks than males, especially when the group included few adult males. Juvenile males were the more central in the play network, having more playmates, playing more, and being connected to other central conspecifics than females. Individuals were consistent in their network position across years despite changes in group composition. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Parrots are often referenced in discussions of social and cognitive complexity, yet relatively little is known of their social organization in the wild. In particular, the presence of long‐lasting social ties has been highlighted as a hallmark of social complexity; however, the presence of such ties can be masked in fission–fusion systems like that exhibited by most parrot species. Social network analysis has the potential to elucidate such multi‐level dynamics.While most parrot species are tropical canopy dwellers, a subset has successfully colonized urban habitats, where they are often the focus of much public interest. Our study takes advantage of this to use citizen science to collect observations of wing‐tagged sulphur‐crested cockatoos in central Sydney and record their social associations over multiple years.Using a specifically designed mobile phone application 'Wingtags', we collected over >27,000 citizen science reports of wing‐tagged cockatoos, and built social networks from spatial‐temporal co‐occurrences in observations for 130 tagged birds. To validate this novel methodology, we GPS‐tagged a subset of wing‐tagged birds and compared networks built from both data collection methods. We then examined correlates of social network structure before exploring the temporal dynamics of network structure and social associations.Social networks constructed from GPS data and citizen science data were highly correlated, suggesting that this novel methodology is robust. Network structure exhibited little seasonal variability and was largely driven by roost site choice; however, individuals also showed a surprising degree of mixing between roosts in their foraging associations. Finally, within this larger fission–fusion system, individuals tended to maintain specific social ties for long periods of time. There was an effect of age on these temporal dynamics, with aging individuals increasing both social stability and longevity of associations.Our findings highlight the utility of citizen science to measure social networks in urban species, and add to the evidence that long‐lasting social associations can persist in fission–fusion social systems such as those observed in wild sulphur‐crested cockatoos.

AB  - Studies increasingly show that social connectedness plays a key role in determining survival, in addition to natural and anthropogenic environmental factors. Few studies, however, integrated social, non-social and demographic data to elucidate what components of an animal's socio-ecological environment are most important to their survival. Female giraffes (Giraffa camelopardalis) form structured societies with highly dynamic group membership but stable long-term associations. We examined the relative contributions of sociability (relationship strength, gregariousness and betweenness), together with those of the natural (food sources and vegetation types) and anthropogenic environment (distance from human settlements), to adult female giraffe survival. We tested predictions about the influence of sociability and natural and human factors at two social levels: the individual and the social community. Survival was primarily driven by individual- rather than community-level social factors. Gregariousness (the number of other females each individual was observed with on average) was most important in explaining variation in female adult survival, more than other social traits and any natural or anthropogenic environmental factors. For adult female giraffes, grouping with more other females, even as group membership frequently changes, is correlated with better survival, and this sociability appears to be more important than several attributes of their non-social environment.

AB  - Although social learning capabilities are taxonomically widespread, demonstrating that freely interacting animals (whether wild or captive) rely on social learning has proved remarkably challenging.Network‐based diffusion analysis (NBDA) offers a means for detecting social learning using observational data on freely interacting groups. Its core assumption is that if a target behaviour is socially transmitted, then its spread should follow the connections in a social network that reflects social learning opportunities.Here, we provide a comprehensive guide for using NBDA. We first introduce its underlying mathematical framework and present the types of questions that NBDA can address. We then guide researchers through the process of selecting an appropriate social network for their research question; determining which NBDA variant should be used; and incorporating other variables that may impact asocial and social learning. Finally, we discuss how to interpret an NBDA model's output and provide practical recommendations for model selection.Throughout, we highlight extensions to the basic NBDA framework, including incorporation of dynamic networks to capture changes in social relationships during a diffusion and using a multi‐network NBDA to estimate information flow across multiple types of social relationship.Alongside this information, we provide worked examples and tutorials demonstrating how to perform analyses using the newly developed nbda package written in the R programming language.

AB  - To thrive in dynamic environments, animals must be capable of rapidly and flexibly adapting behavioral responses to a changing context and internal state. Examples of behavioral flexibility include faster stimulus responses when attentive and slower responses when distracted. Contextual or state-dependent modulations may occur early in the cortical hierarchy and may be implemented via top-down projections from corticocortical or neuromodulatory pathways. However, the computational mechanisms mediating the effects of such projections are not known. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework to classify the effects of cell type-specific top-down perturbations on the information processing speed of cortical circuits. Our theory demonstrates that perturbation effects on stimulus processing can be predicted by intrinsic gain modulation, which controls the timescale of the circuit dynamics. Our theory leads to counterintuitive effects, such as improved performance with increased input variance. We tested the model predictions using large-scale electrophysiological recordings from the visual hierarchy in freely running mice, where we found that a decrease in single-cell intrinsic gain during locomotion led to an acceleration of visual processing. Our results establish a novel theory of cell type-specific perturbations, applicable to topdown modulation as well as optogenetic and pharmacological manipulations. Our theory links connectivity, dynamics, and information processing via gain modulation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The social decisions that individuals make—who to interact with and how frequently—give rise to social structure. The resulting social structure then determines how individuals interact with their surroundings—resources and risks, pathogens and predators, competitors and cooperators.However, despite intensive research on (a) how individuals make social decisions and (b) how social structure shapes social processes (e.g. cooperation, competition and conflict), there are still few studies linking these two perspectives. These perspectives represent two halves of a feedback loop: individual behaviour scales up to define the social environment, and this environment, in turn, feeds back by shaping the selective agents that drive individual behaviour.We first review well‐established research areas that have captured both elements of this feedback loop—host–pathogen dynamics and cultural transmission. We then highlight areas where social structure is well studied but the two perspectives remain largely disconnected. Finally, we synthesise existing research on 14 distinct research topics to identify new prospects where the interplay between social structure and social processes are likely to be important but remain largely unexplored.Our review shows that the inherent links between individuals' traits, their social decisions, social structure and social evolution, warrant more consideration. By mapping the existing and missing connections among many research areas, our review highlights where explicitly considering social structure and the individual‐to‐society feedbacks can reveal new dimensions to old questions in ecology and evolution.

AB  - Social network analysis (SNA) has recently emerged as a fundamental tool to study animal behavior. While many studies have analyzed the relationship between environmental factors and behavior across large, complex animal populations, few have focused on species living in small groups due to limitations of the statistical methods currently employed. Some of the difficulties are often in comparing social structure across different sized groups and accounting for zero‐inflation generated by analyzing small social units. Here, we use a case study to highlight how Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) and hurdle models can overcome the issues inherent to study of social network metrics of groups that are small and variable in size. We applied this approach to study aggressive behavior in the Alpine marmot (Marmotamarmota) using an eight‐year long dataset of behavioral interactions across 17 small family groups (7.4 ± 3.3 individuals). We analyzed the effect of individual and group‐level factors on aggression, including predictors frequently inferred in species with larger groups, as the closely related yellow‐bellied marmot (Marmotaflaviventris). Our approach included the use of hurdle GLMMs to analyze the zero‐inflated metrics that are typical of aggressive networks of small social groups. Additionally, our results confirmed previously reported effects of dominance and social status on aggression levels, thus supporting the efficacy of our approach. We found differences between males and females in terms of levels of aggression and on the roles occupied by each in agonistic networks that were not predicted in a socially monogamous species. Finally, we provide some perspectives on social network analysis as applied to small social groups to inform subsequent studies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Productive and ecologically highly valuable ecosystems, macrotidal estuaries are also characterised by complex habitat and connectivity dynamics driven by tidal and freshwater influence. Organisms living in these constantly changing systems have to match their movement patterns to the shifting habitat mosaic using available windows of connectivity to access habitat patches of interest. This appears particularly important for the juvenile stages of many fish species colonising shallow and intertidal areas of the estuaries as summer nurseries. We apply tools from landscape ecology to investigate the estuarine habitat and connectivity dynamics on the example of juvenile seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). We test under which conditions spatio-temporal bottlenecks to estuarine nursery colonisation may emerge for this species in a human-modified estuary. Combining a hydrodynamic model of the Seine estuary with remote sensing data allows us to capture structural changes in habitat availability and connectivity at the estuarine scale and at a fine spatio-temporal resolution. With chronological least-cost modelling of successive tidal steps, we assess patterns of nursery accessibility and estimate tidal colonisation fronts for different mobility scenarios. We show that, at certain hydrological conditions, tidal water level variation causes local disruptions of habitat availability and connectivity, creating temporary bottlenecks for seabass juveniles' movement. Fish mobility appears determinant for their vulnerability to these connectivity disruptions. Our approach allows for quantitative assessment and visualisation of riverscape complexity related to tidal dynamics. It is applicable to other highly dynamic ecosystems, where the mobile nature of connectivity and habitats needs to be integrated into conservation and management planning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Aims Adaptive convergence in floral phenotype among plants sharing a pollinator guild has been acknowledged in the concept of pollination syndrome. However, many plants display traits associated with a given syndrome, but are visited by multiple pollinators. This situation may indicate the beginning of a pollinator shift or may result in a stable situation with adaptations to different pollinators. In Salvia stachydifolia , a previous study suggested that flower shape is optimized to maximize the contribution to pollination of bees and hummingbirds. Here, we studied three additional aspects of its floral biology: sexual phases, nectar dynamics and breeding system, and examined their connection with pollinators' behaviour to explore the presence of adaptations to bee and/or hummingbird pollination. Methods Using a greenhouse population, we applied five pollination treatments to characterize breeding system. To determine sexual phases, we recorded flower opening, anther dehiscence, corolla fall and stigma receptivity. Additionally, we characterized nectar volume and concentration dynamics along the day. Finally, to determine pollinator assemblage and visitation patterns, we performed field observations and recorded pollinators' behaviour. Important Findings Salvia stachydifolia was partially protandrous and self-compatible, but open-pollinated plants attained the highest reproductive success, suggesting that reproduction is mainly dependent on pollinator activity. Bombus opifex bumblebees were the most frequent visitors, but Sappho sparganura hummingbirds dominated visits early in the morning and at dusk. Nectar was typical of bumblebee pollination. We suggest that the bee–hummingbird mixed visitation constitutes an unstable evolutionary situation, making S. stachydifolia an ideal system to understand the ecological circumstances in which pollination shifts occur.

AB  - In a captive environment, it is challenging to ensure the highest level of social and psychological well-being for species with naturally complex social organizations and structures. There is a growing need to meet the social requirements for individuals of these species, especially chimpanzees, housed in zoos, sanctuaries, rehabilitation centers, and laboratories. Complex social interactions and broader social structures can be aptly described via social network analysis. We expand on the literature regarding captive chimpanzee social networks, but uniquely consider their human caregivers as potential social partners. We observed the social interactions between one group of seven chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and their caregivers in six behavioral contexts (nearest neighbor, play, aggression, grooming, grooming solicitation, and social vigilance) at Chimpanzee Sanctuary Northwest (USA). By constructing multiple chimpanzee and chimpanzee-caregiver social networks, our results indicate that caregivers are integrated partners in this group's social structure. Additionally, we observed that the type and strength of chimpanzee-caregiver relationships varied between the chimpanzees. These results support the notion that caregivers offer additional opportunities (i.e., beyond those with conspecifics) for captive chimpanzees to construct and maintain meaningful social relationships. Our results show that considerations of captive primate social dynamics should include caregivers as potentially important social partners. Our results also highlight the importance of evaluating individual chimpanzee characteristics when developing philosophies of care and adopting husbandry practices that offer fulfilling social niches. Our findings bear influence on contemporary discussions of interspecies social relationships, captive welfare, health, translocation, and husbandry protocols for captive chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates.

AB  - Statistical modelling of animal movement data is a rapidly growing area of research. Typically though, these models have been developed for analysing the tracks of individual animals and we lose sight of the impact animals have on each other with regards to their movement behaviours. We aim to develop a model with a flexible social framework that allows us to capture that information.Our approach is based on the concept of social hierarchies, and this is embedded in a multivariate diffusion process which models the movement of a group of animals. The possibility of switching between behavioural states facilitates dynamic social behaviours and we augment the observed data with sampled state switching times in order to model the animals' behaviour naturally in continuous time. In addition, this enables us to carry out exact inference in a Bayesian setting with the benefits of being able to handle regular, irregular and missing data. All movement and behaviour parameters are estimated with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods.We examine the capability of our model with simulated data before fitting it to GPS locations of five wild olive baboons Papio anubis. The results enable us to identify which animals are influencing the movement of others and when, which provides both a dynamic and long‐term static insight into the group's social behaviours.Our model offers a flexible method in continuous time with which to model the network of social interactions within animal movement. Doing so avoids the limitations caused by a discrete‐time approach and it allows us to capture rich information with regards to a group's social structure, leading to constructive applications in conservation and management decisions. However, currently it is a computationally expensive task to fit the model to data, which in turns limits extending the model to more fruitful but complex cases such as heterogeneity in space or individual characteristics. Furthermore, our social hierarchy approach assumes all relevant animals are tracked and that any interactions have some ordering, both of which narrow the scope within which this approach is appropriate.

AB  - Social and environmental disturbance occurs naturally, and species in bonded social groups should be resilient to it. Empirical evidence of social responses to disturbance in primates, however, remains limited. We constructed social networks using group-level scan samples (N = 299) to test the robustness of grooming networks in a captive group of 20 Sulawesi crested macaques (Macaca nigra) to two management interventions involving environmental and social disturbance. During the first, the institution removed six castrated males and one female, contracepted six of the nine remaining females, and moved the group to a new enclosure. The second involved the introduction of a novel, reproductive male five weeks later. Networks remained stable following the first intervention. However, after introduction of the male, the number of grooming partners and the frequency of grooming with non-maternal kin increased in female-only networks. We observed less marked increases in the grooming frequency and number of grooming partners in whole group networks. Ten weeks later, network structure was more similar to that of pre-intervention networks than post-intervention networks. Our results suggest that reproductive males play a more important role in structuring Sulawesi crested macaque social networks than castrated males, as networks expanded and relationships between non-maternal kin occurred more frequently after introduction of the reproductive male. However, network responses to interventions appeared to be temporary as networks following a period of acclimation more closely resembled pre-intervention networks than post-intervention networks. Our study demonstrates the utility of social network analysis for understanding the impact of disturbance on stable social groups. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In recent times, interest has grown in understanding how microbiomes – the collection of microorganisms in a specific environment – influence the survivability or fitness of their plant and animal hosts. The profound diversity of bacterial and fungal species found in certain environments, such as soil, provides a large pool of potential microbial partners that can interact in ways that reveal patterns of associations linking host–microbiome traits developed over time. However, most microbiome sequence data are reported as a community fingerprint, without analysis of interaction networks across microbial taxa through time.To address this knowledge gap, more robust tools are needed to account for microbiome dynamics that could signal a beneficial change to a plant or animal host. In this paper, we discuss applying mathematical tools, such as dynamic network modelling, which involves the use of longitudinal data to study system dynamics and microbiomes that identify potential alterations in microbial communities over time in response to an environmental change. In addition, we discuss the potential challenges and pitfalls of these methodologies, such as handling large amounts of sequencing data and accounting for random processes that influence community dynamics, as well as potential ways to address them.Ultimately, we argue that components of microbial community interactions can be characterized through mathematical models to reveal insights into complex dynamics associated with a plant or animal host trait. The inclusion of interaction networks in microbiome studies could provide insights into the behaviour of complex communities in tandem with host trait modification and evolution.

AB  - Many animals live and breed in colonies, and yet, with just a few exceptions, the value of the social bonds between colony members has rarely been examined. Social ties are important for group coordination at collective tasks, and social coordination can facilitate synchronized reproduction among colony members. Synchronized reproduction in turn can amplify the benefits of coloniality, such as social foraging and predator avoidance.We conducted a field study to investigate whether synchronized reproduction among individuals in replicated colonies is linked to the strength of their social bond, and whether these strong bonds are maintained beyond the reproductive period.We PIT‐tagged wild zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), monitoring their reproduction and social foraging over two consecutive years. We then used social network analysis to characterize the strength of social bonds among birds in the population.We show that birds that are more synchronized in their reproductive timing (and breed in the same colony) had significantly stronger social ties both during and after reproduction than expected by chance. Our long‐term sampling also revealed that the strong social ties between synchronized breeders were carried over across years.Our study reveals a strong correspondence between synchronized breeding and the social structure of the breeding colony. This suggests that the synchrony between pairs is not a simple process based on opportunity, but a mechanism underpinned by more complex sociality, which could be carried over to other behavioural contexts. The maintenance of cross‐contextual social ties across years suggests that social structure could have extensive consequences on the overall life history of individuals in addition to playing a key role for the reproductive dynamics of colonial breeders.

AB  - The prevalence of human-generated noise is posing novel challenges to birds, by changing how they communicate or causing them to disperse away from the source of noise. We sought to understand how noise affected space-use and social connectivity in a small passerine bird, the Red-backed Fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus). As the displaced birds would likely be forced to occupy a smaller area that may already have resident individuals, we predicted that noise-affected birds would show increased social connectivity that may include new individuals. To test this, we introduced an experimental point-source of traffic noise to groups of fairywrens in an otherwise quiet habitat and compared the change in social connectivity of birds in groups exposed to noise to the changes in social connectivity in neighbouring groups unaffected by noise. Contrary to our prediction, noise-affected birds had reduced social connectivity during experimental noise treatments, as measured by weighted-degree, which was driven by a reduction of interactions with birds of neighbouring groups outside the noise zone. Additionally, we did not discern a change in space-use in response to our noise treatment. Therefore, we suggest that noise reduces the efficacy of signal transmission and detection in this species, resulting in the reduction of social connectivity between groups of this otherwise highly social songbird.

AB  - Because of the nature of social interaction or association data, when testing hypotheses using social network data it is common for network studies to rely on permutations to control for confounding variables, and to not also control for them in the fitted statistical model. This can be a problem because it does not adjust for any bias in effect sizes generated by these confounding effects, and thus the effect sizes are not informative in the presence of confounding variables.We implemented two network simulation examples and analysed an empirical dataset to demonstrate how relying solely on permutations to control for confounding variables can result in highly biased effect size estimates of animal social preferences that are uninformative when quantifying differences in behaviour.Using these simulations, we show that this can sometimes even lead to effect sizes that have the wrong sign and are thus the effect size is not biologically interpretable. We demonstrate how this problem can be addressed by controlling for confounding variables in the statistical dyadic or nodal model.We recommend this approach should be adopted as standard practice in the statistical analysis of animal social network data.

AB  - Social media is often used to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and engage the public, which can change the public's attitudes and behaviors and may be used to benefit conservation. Moreover, widespread social media use provides an alternative data sourcing platform to inexpensively access countless potential respondents. However, social media data have rarely been used in conservation regardless of the potential benefit to conservation science and practice. We administered a questionnaire via the #CougarOrNot Twitter game, a mountain lion‐focused social media campaign, during 26 December 2016 through 16 February 2018, to access a large respondent sample (n = 1,481) and assess a subset of social media users' attitudes toward mountain lions in North America. We then used cumulative link models in an information theoretic approach to gauge the association between respondent level of engagement with #CougarOrNot and other sociodemographic predictors with user attitudes toward mountain lions. Respondent attitudes toward mountain lions were largely positive (83%), with frequent participants in #CougarOrNot, females, pet owners, nonconsumptive recreators, and households with fewer children exhibiting positive attitudes. #CougarOrNot participation had a stronger correlation with respondent attitudes toward mountain lions than commonly used predictors employed in prior studies (i.e. age, education level, livestock ownership). #CougarOrNot may promote positive attitudes toward mountain lions, though additional research is needed to determine the direct effects of playing the game. Stakeholders interested in mountain lion conservation or other conservation topics could be identified via social media networks attached to specific outreach campaigns and possibly mobilized to support conservation actions that aid mountain lions and conservation in general. © 2021 The Wildlife Society. Social media games, such as #CougarOrNot, may be a useful tool to conservation practitioners attempting to promote awareness regarding mountain lions and other large carnivores in North America. Additionally, social media outreach campaigns may be an effective and efficient way of identifying and mobilizing stakeholders that are interested in specific conservation topics.

AB  - Individual‐level traits mediate interaction outcomes and community structure. It is important, therefore, to identify the minimum number of traits that characterise ecological networks, that is, their 'minimum dimensionality'. Existing methods for estimating minimum dimensionality often lack three features associated with increased trait numbers: alternative interaction modes (e.g. feeding strategies such as active vs. sit‐and‐wait feeding), trait‐mediated 'forbidden links' and a mechanistic description of interactions. Omitting these features can underestimate the trait numbers involved, and therefore, minimum dimensionality. We develop a 'minimum mechanistic dimensionality' measure, accounting for these three features.The only input our method requires is the network of interaction outcomes. We assume how traits are mechanistically involved in alternative interaction modes. These unidentified traits are contrasted using pairwise performance inequalities between interacting species. For example, if a predator feeds upon a prey species via a typical predation mode, in each step of the predation sequence, the predator's performance must be greater than the prey's. We construct a system of inequalities from all observed outcomes, which we attempt to solve with mixed integer linear programming. The number of traits required for a feasible system of inequalities provides our minimum dimensionality estimate.We applied our method to 658 published empirical ecological networks including primary consumption, predator–prey, parasitism, pollination, seed dispersal and animal dominance networks, to compare with minimum dimensionality estimates when the three focal features are missing. Minimum dimensionality was typically higher when including alternative interaction modes (54% of empirical networks), 'forbidden interactions' as trait‐mediated interaction outcomes (92%) or a mechanistic perspective (81%), compared to estimates missing these features. Additionally, we tested minimum dimensionality estimates on simulated networks with known dimensionality. Our method typically estimated a higher minimum dimensionality, closer to the actual dimensionality, while avoiding the overestimation associated with a previous method.Our method can reduce the risk of omitting traits involved in different interaction modes, in failure outcomes or mechanistically. More accurate estimates will allow us to parameterise models of theoretical networks with more realistic structure at the interaction outcome level. Thus, we hope our method can improve predictions of community structure and structure‐dependent dynamics. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Incorporating host behavioral variation into epidemiological models is important for predicting host-pathogen dynamics. Animals living at high densities or with many strong social connections are predicted to have greater risk of acquiring pathogens. Using social network analysis, we tested the hypothesis that variation in the strength of social connections would influence simulated elk (Cervus canadensis) pathogen dynamics. We quantified fine-scale social connections for captive elk at three experimentally manipulated densities and wild elk at two natural densities. We applied susceptible-infected epidemiological models to networks to infer the relationship between fine-scale host sociality and simulated pathogen dynamics. Networks were filtered based on four association thresholds to determine how variation in the strength of social connections influenced pathogen dynamics. Our simulations suggest that social behavior interacts with population density to predict pathogen dynamics, but this effect was sex-specific. For both males and females at higher density, elk had strong social connections, resulting in higher number of infected individuals. We observed differences in social connections across density, and these results translated to our simulations, which predicted density-dependent pathogen dynamics for captive and wild elk networks. Our results highlight host social behavior as a potential mechanism driving variation in the relationship between population density and pathogen dynamics. Elk are reservoir hosts for numerous emerging infectious diseases, and our models suggest that density-dependent host social behavior could influence pathogen dynamics in elk social networks. Significance statement: Animal population density can influence transmission of parasites and pathogens, but variation in social connections at different densities could impact this relationship. Using social network analysis and epidemiological simulations, we tested the hypothesis that density-dependent variation in social connections would influence pathogen dynamics using captive and free-ranging populations of elk (Cervus elaphus). For all elk groups, simulated number of infected individuals increased with social connectedness. In addition, our simulations suggest that social connectedness interacts with population density to predict number of infected individuals, but this effect was sex-specific. For males and females at high density, elk had strong social connections, resulting in more infected individuals; this relationship was linear for males and non-linear for females. Taken together, our results suggest fine-scale measures of social behavior vary with population density, a result which could have implications for pathogen dynamics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Vocal signals mediate social relationships, and among networks of territorial animals, information is often shared via broadcast vocalizations. Anthropogenic noise may disrupt communication among individuals within networks, as animals change the way they vocalize in noise. Furthermore, constraints on signal transmission, including frequency masking and distance, may affect information exchange following a disruption in social networks. We tested the hypothesis that signaling interactions within networks of breeding male and female house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) depend on distance, ambient noise, and receiver nesting stage. We used playback experiments to simulate territorial intrusions with and without noise playbacks on the territories of established males and simultaneously recorded the vocal responses of neighbors. To examine whether intrusions impacted interactions between males, we used randomization tests to determine whether treatment, distance, noise, or nesting stage affected vocal coordination between challenged and neighboring males. We also quantified singing patterns to explore whether intrusions on territories of challenged males affected singing by males and females on neighboring territories. Males sang at the lowest rates and were less likely to overlap songs with the challenged male when their partner was laying, compared to males during early and late nesting stages. Noise and distance did not affect vocal coordination or male singing rates. Fewer females sang during the intruder‐only treatment compared to the control and intrusions with noise. Added noise in the territories of challenged males may have masked signals, and as a result, females only changed their behavior during the intruder‐only treatment. Our results suggest that the fertility of breeding partners may be more important to males than short‐term changes on rival male territories. Elevated noise did little to alter male responses to threats within networks. Females appeared to eavesdrop on interactions involving neighboring males, but noise may have prevented detection of their interactions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Fish are both consumers and prey, and as such part of a dynamic trophic network. Measuring how they are trophically linked, both directly and indirectly, to other species is vital to comprehend the mechanisms driving alterations in fish communities in space and time. Moreover, this knowledge also helps to understand how fish communities respond to environmental change and delivers important information for implementing management of fish stocks. DNA‐based methods have significantly widened our ability to assess trophic interactions in both marine and freshwater systems and they possess a range of advantages over other approaches in diet analysis. In this review we provide an overview of different DNA‐based methods that have been used to assess trophic interactions of fish as consumers and prey. We consider the practicalities and limitations, and emphasize critical aspects when analysing molecular derived trophic data. We exemplify how molecular techniques have been employed to unravel food web interactions involving fish as consumers and prey. In addition to the exciting opportunities DNA‐based approaches offer, we identify current challenges and future prospects for assessing fish food webs where DNA‐based approaches will play an important role.

AB  - Demographic processes play a key role in shaping the patterns of social relations among individuals in a population. Social network analysis is a powerful quantitative tool for assessing the social structure formed by associations between individuals. However, demographic processes are rarely accounted for in such analyses. Here, we summarize how the structure of animal social networks is shaped by the joint effects of social behavior and turnover of individuals and suggest how a deeper understanding of these processes can open new, exciting avenues for research. Death or dispersal can have the direct effect of removing an individual and all its social connections, and can also have indirect effects, spurring changes in the distribution of social connections between remaining individuals. Recruitment and integration of juveniles and immigrant into existing social networks are critical to the emergence and persistence of social network structure. Together, these behavioral responses to loss and gain of social partners may impact how societies respond to seasonal or catastrophic turnover events. The fitness consequences of social position (e.g., survival and reproductive rates) may also create feedback between the social network structure and demography. Understanding how social structure changes in response to turnover of individuals requires further integration between long-term field studies and network modeling methods. These efforts will likely yield new insights into the connections between social networks and life history, ecological change, and evolutionary dynamics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social interactions present opportunities for both information and infection to spread through populations. Social learning is often proposed as a key benefit of sociality, while infectious disease spread are proposed as a major cost. Multiple empirical and theoretical studies have demonstrated the importance of social structure for the transmission of either information or harmful pathogens and parasites, but rarely in combination. We provide an overview of relevant empirical studies, discuss differences in the transmission processes of infection and information, and review how these processes have been modelled. Finally, we highlight ways in which animal social network structure and dynamics might mediate the tradeoff between the sharing of information and infection. We reveal how modular social network structures can promote the spread of information and mitigate against the spread of infection relative to other network structures. We discuss how the maintenance of long‐term social bonds, clustering of social contacts in time, and adaptive plasticity in behavioural interactions, all play important roles in influencing the transmission of information and infection. We provide novel hypotheses and suggest new directions for research that quantifies the transmission of information and infection simultaneously across different network structures to help tease apart their influence on the evolution of social behaviour.

AB  - Species afflicted by multiple threats are thought to face greater extinction risk. However, it is not known whether multiple threats operate antagonistically, additively, or synergistically, or whether they vary across different taxonomic and spatial scales. We addressed these questions by analyzing threats to 10,378 species in six vertebrate classes at global and regional spatial scales using network analysis. The total number of threats was a poor predictor of extinction risk, and particular combinations of threats did not predict extinction risk in the same way at different spatial scales. The exception was cartilaginous fishes, which faced increased extinction risk with increasing numbers of threats. Except for cartilaginous fishes, our findings indicate that species facing more threats than others do not face a higher risk of extinction and suggest that effective conservation will require more investment in identifying how threats and different ecosystem stressors operate together at local scales.

AB  - As declines in biodiversity accelerate, there is an urgent imperative to ensure that every dollar spent on conservation counts toward species protection. Systematic conservation planning is a widely used approach to achieve this, but there is growing concern that it must better integrate the human social dimensions of conservation to be effective. Yet, fundamental insights about when social data are most critical to inform conservation planning decisions are lacking. To address this problem, we derived novel principles to guide strategic investment in social network information for systematic conservation planning. We considered the common conservation problem of identifying which social actors, in a social network, to engage with to incentivize conservation behavior that maximizes the number of species protected. We used simulations of social networks and species distributed across network nodes to identify the optimal state‐dependent strategies and the value of social network information. We did this for a range of motif network structures and species distributions and applied the approach to a small‐scale fishery in Kenya. The value of social network information depended strongly on both the distribution of species and social network structure. When species distributions were highly nested (i.e., when species‐poor sites are subsets of species‐rich sites), the value of social network information was almost always low. This suggests that information on how species are distributed across a network is critical for determining whether to invest in collecting social network data. In contrast, the value of social network information was greatest when social networks were highly centralized. Results for the small‐scale fishery were consistent with the simulations. Our results suggest that strategic collection of social network data should be prioritized when species distributions are un‐nested and when social networks are likely to be centralized. Article impact statement: The value of collecting social network information for conservation planning depends on both species distributions and social network structure.

AB  - Distance between habitats may impact the composition and corresponding interactions between trophic levels. Mutualistic networks, such as those of plants and pollinators tend to have a core set of properties that often relate to the resilience of the community, or the ability of the community to retain function and structure after a disturbance. Furthermore, network structure is highly dependent on the number of specialists and generalists; however, it is unclear how different groups of species with various life-history strategies influence network structure. In this study, we evaluated how the composition of plants and pollinators within 16 oak-savanna sites changed across a latitudinal gradient. In addition, we evaluated how the abundance of different groups of plants and pollinators affected network metrics related to resilience. We found that the composition of plants and pollinators varied between ecoregions, while pollinator composition further varied with habitat characteristics. Network metrics displayed no spatial pattern but were related to the abundance of several pollinator groups. Above-ground nesting insects had a positive relationship with nestedness and a negative relationship with modularity, while predatory larvae had a negative relationship with modularity. Thus, above-ground nesting insects and predatory larvae could be expected to increase network resilience. This study emphasizes how spatial scales can influence species compositions, which in turn affects the structure of interactions in the community with implications for resilience.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that animal personality can affect many aspects of an individual's behaviour, life history and fitness. However, there have been few studies about the link between personality and social organization in the context of wild mammals in their own natural environments. This article reports on ecologically relevant data, linking experimental data from the wild to long-term social association data in a socially and cognitively complex mammal species (bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops truncatus). Here, I used behavioural data to describe personality differences between bottlenose dolphins and social network analysis to assess the relationship between personality and social structure. First, I measured the reaction of photo-identified individuals over time and across contexts as a trade-off between a novelty-seeking behaviour (boldness) and a novelty-averse behaviour (shyness). Second, I applied social network analysis to understand the link between the observed shy–bold continuum and social organization, while controlling for other factors that could contribute to affiliation. This study presents for the first time consistent individual differences in behavioural response to novelty, as a proxy for the shy–bold continuum, in wild bottlenose dolphins. Bold individuals had a central role in the social network with stronger associations than shy individuals, suggesting that bold individuals may play an important role in group cohesion, group stability and the spread of information through the network. Together, these findings provide insights into how a social network is structured by personality in wild bottlenose dolphins, with potential fitness consequences. Furthermore, this study provides additional evidence of the existence of social personalities in nonhuman animals and contributes to the understanding of the role of personality in determining the extent to which mammals associate with others. • Wild bottlenose dolphins show individual differences in neophilia. • Bottlenose dolphin social network is structured by personality. • Bold dolphins have a central role in the social network. • Thus, bold dolphins probably play an important role in group cohesion and stability. • Thus, bold dolphins probably play an important role in spread of information.

AB  - Infections can change social behaviour in multiple ways, with profound impacts on pathogen transmission. However, these impacts might depend on the type of behaviour, how sociality as a biological trait is defined (e.g. network degree vs. mean edge strength) and the type of social relationship between the interacting individuals.We used the highly social common vampire bat Desmodus rotundus to test how an immune challenge by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injections affects two different social behaviours and three alternate measures of sociality, and whether the LPS effect differs by kinship relationship.Effects of sickness should be lower for social behaviours that bestow greater benefits to inclusive fitness, such as food sharing. As predicted, immune‐challenged bats experienced a greater reduction in allogrooming received than food sharing received.Sickness effects might also depend on how a social interaction is defined (e.g. the number of grooming partners vs. the duration of grooming events). We predicted that sickness would impact both the number and duration of social encounters, but we only detected a decrease in the number of grooming partners.Finally, sickness effects might vary with social relationship type. We predicted that sickness effects should be smaller for interactions among close kin. As expected, the immune challenge had smaller effects on mother–offspring interactions.In conclusion, our results highlight the need to explicitly consider how the effects of sickness on social network structure can differ depending on the 'who, what, and how' of social interactions, because these factors are likely to influence how sickness behaviour alters pathogen transmission.

AB  - Nest building consists of a series of motor actions, which are concomitant with activity in regions of the anterior motor pathway, the social behavior network, and the reward circuity in nest building adult male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata). It is not clear, however, whether this activity is due to nest building, collection, and/or manipulation of nest material. To identify which areas of the brain are specifically involved, we used immunohistochemistry to quantify the immediate early gene c- Fos in male zebra finches that were nest building (Building), birds given a nest box but could interact only with tied down nest material (Fixed), and birds that were not given a nest box or nest material (Control). We investigated the following brain regions: the anterior motor pathway (anterior ventral mesopallium [AMV], AN, anterior striatum [ASt]), areas of the social behavior network (bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsomedial subdivision [BSTmd], lateral septum [LS]), the dopaminergic reward circuitry (ventral tegmental area), and the cerebellum. We found that there was greater Fos immunoreactivity expression in the BSTmd, LS, and AMV with increased material deposition; in LS, AMV ASt, and Folium VI with increased material carrying; in LS, AMV, and ASt with increased nest material tucking; and in LS and all folia (except Folium VIII) with increased tugging at tied down material. These data confirm a functional role for areas of the anterior motor pathway, social behavior network, and the cerebellum in nest material collection and manipulation by birds.

AB  - Climate connectivity, the ability of a landscape to promote or hinder the movement of organisms in response to a changing climate, is contingent on multiple factors including the distance organisms need to move to track suitable climate over time (i.e. climate velocity) and the resistance they experience along such routes. An additional consideration which has received less attention is that human land uses increase resistance to movement or alter movement routes and thus influence climate connectivity. Here we evaluate the influence of human land uses on climate connectivity across North America by comparing two climate connectivity scenarios, one considering climate change in isolation and the other considering climate change and human land uses. In doing so, we introduce a novel metric of climate connectivity, 'human exposure', that quantifies the cumulative exposure to human activities that organisms may encounter as they shift their ranges in response to climate change. We also delineate potential movement routes and evaluate whether the protected area network supports movement corridors better than non‐protected lands. We found that when incorporating human land uses, climate connectivity decreased; climate velocity increased on average by 0.3 km/year and cumulative climatic resistance increased for ~83% of the continent. Moreover, ~96% of movement routes in North America must contend with human land uses to some degree. In the scenario that evaluated climate change in isolation, we found that protected areas do not support climate corridors at a higher rate than non‐protected lands across North America. However, variability is evident, as many ecoregions contain protected areas that exhibit both more and less representation of climate corridors compared to non‐protected lands. Overall, our study indicates that previous evaluations of climate connectivity underestimate climate change exposure because they do not account for human impacts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Memory stability is essential for animal survival when environment and behavioral state change over short or long time spans. The stability of a memory can be expressed by its duration, its perseverance when conditions change as well as its specificity to the learned stimulus. Using optogenetic and pharmacological manipulations in male mice, we show that the presence of noradrenaline in the olfactory bulb during acquisition renders olfactory memories more stable. We show that while inhibition of noradrenaline transmission during an odor-reward acquisition has no acute effects, it alters perseverance, duration, and specificity of the memory. We use a computational approach to propose a proof of concept model showing that a single, simple network effect of noradrenaline on olfactory bulb dynamics can underlie these seemingly different behavioral effects. Our results show that acute changes in network dynamics can have long-term effects that extend beyond the network that was manipulated. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Under predation threat, many species produce cues that can serve as crucial sources of information for social companions. For instance, chemical cues released when experiencing a disturbing event (i.e. 'disturbance cues'), such as a predator chase, can lead to antipredator avoidance and increased survival for nearby individuals. These chemicals also have potential to be produced as a voluntary signal for communicating threat to others. We found evidence for this hypothesis by manipulating the shoal familiarity of guppies from populations differing in background predation risk and then presenting their disturbance cues to unfamiliar conspecifics from the same populations. Receivers from low-risk sites increased shoal cohesion and decreased area use regardless of whether the disturbance cues were produced in donor groups where members were familiar or unfamiliar with each other. However, receivers from high-risk sites showed strong antipredator reactions towards disturbance chemicals produced in familiar groups and no response towards those produced in unfamiliar groups, suggesting that donors from high-risk sites may alter the quality or quantity of their disturbance cues to influence familiar individuals to enact predator defences. Because high-risk environments strengthen guppy social networks, these environments may facilitate reliance on chemical disturbance signalling to coordinate group defences with familiar individuals.

AB  - Wildlife are increasingly subject to perturbations, which can impact pathogen transmission and lead to disease emergence. While a myriad of factors influence disease dynamics in wildlife, behaviour is emerging as a major influence. In this review, we examine how perturbations alter the behaviour of individuals and how, in turn, disease transmission may be impacted, with a focus on the use of network models as a powerful tool. There are emerging hypotheses as to how networks respond to different types of perturbations. The broad effects of perturbations make predicting potential outcomes and identifying mitigation opportunities for disease emergence critical; yet, the current paucity of data makes identification of underlying trends difficult. Social network analysis facilitates a mechanistic approach to how perturbation-induced behavioural changes result in shifts in pathogen transmission. However, the field is still developing, and future work should strive to address current deficits. There is particular need for empirical data to support modelling predictions and increased inclusion of pathogen monitoring in network studies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - When the consequences of sociality differ depending on the state of individual animals and the experienced environment, individuals may benefit from altering their social behaviours in a context‐dependent manner. Thus, to fully address the hypotheses about the role of social associations it is imperative to consider the multidimensional nature of sociality by explicitly examining social associations across multiple scales and contexts. We simultaneously recorded > 8000 associations from 85% of breeding individuals from a colony of Australasian gannets (Morus serrator) over a 2‐week period, and examined gregariousness across four foraging states using multilayer social network analysis. We found that social associations varied in a context‐dependent manner, highlighting that social associations are most prevalent during foraging (local enhancement) and in regions expected to provide clustered resources. We also provide evidence of individual consistency in gregariousness, but flexibility in social associates, demonstrating that individuals can adjust their social behaviours to match experienced conditions.

AB  - Ecosystems are linked by the movement of organisms across habitat boundaries and the arrangement of habitat patches can affect species abundance and composition. In tropical seascapes many coral reef fishes settle in adjacent habitats and undergo ontogenetic habitat shifts to coral reefs as they grow. Few studies have attempted to measure at what distances from nursery habitats these fish migrations (connectivity) cease to exist and how the abundance, biomass and proportion of nursery species change on coral reefs along distance gradients away from nursery areas. The present study examines seascape spatial arrangement, including distances between habitats, and its consequences on connectivity within a tropical seascape in Mozambique using a seascape ecology approach. Fish and habitat surveys were undertaken in 2016/2017 and a thematic habitat map was created in ArcGIS, where cover and distances between habitat patches were calculated. Distance to mangroves and seagrasses were significant predictors for abundance and biomass of most nursery species. The proportions of nursery species were highest in the south of the archipelago, where mangroves were present and decreased with distance to nurseries (mangroves and seagrasses). Some nursery species were absent on reef sites farthest from nursery habitats, at 80 km from mangroves and at 12 km from seagrass habitats. The proportion of nursery/non‐nursery snapper and parrotfish species, as well as abundance and biomass of seagrass nursery species abruptly declined at 8 km from seagrass habitats, indicating a threshold distance at which migrations may cease. Additionally, reefs isolated by large stretches of sand and deep water had very low abundances of several nursery species despite being within moderate distances from nursery habitats. This highlights the importance of considering the matrix (sand and deep water) as barriers for fish migration. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social interactions affect the transmission of many pathogens, but infections often induce sickness behaviours that alter those interactions. Vampire bats are highly mobile and social, engaging in frequent allogrooming, which is likely to facilitate pathogen spread. Sickness behaviour is known to reduce social associations, but the effect on physical interactions between associated individuals, such as grooming, is less understood. Here, we tested the effects of induced sickness behaviour on allogrooming in vampire bats, while holding association between individuals in groups constant. To experimentally induce sickness behaviour, we used injections of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and saline controls in 13 female common vampire bats, Desmodus rotundus , housed in stable groups of two to four adult bats. LPS injection induced an immune response that mimicked illness. Circulating leukocytes and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratios increased, while body mass and activity decreased. While LPS-injected bats did not receive less grooming from their group mates, they dramatically reduced the amount that they groomed their partners. This reduction in social interactions illustrates that sickness behaviour can potentially change transmission rates by altering directed behaviours, even under conditions of constant close proximity. The ability to manipulate social behaviours under controlled conditions should also prove useful for experiments attempting to test mechanisms underlying cooperation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: The disease costs of sociality have largely been understood through the link between group size and transmission. However, infectious disease spread is driven primarily by the social organization of interactions in a group and not its size. We used statistical models to review the social network organization of 47 species, including mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and insects by categorizing each species into one of three social systems, <italic>relatively solitary, gregarious</italic> and <italic>socially hierarchical</italic>. Additionally, using computational experiments of infection spread, we determined the disease costs of each social system. We find that relatively solitary species have large variation in number of social partners, that socially hierarchical species are the least clustered in their interactions, and that social networks of gregarious species tend to be the most fragmented. However, these structural differences are primarily driven by weak connections, which suggest that different social systems have evolved unique strategies to organize weak ties. Our synthetic disease experiments reveal that social network organization can mitigate the disease costs of group living for socially hierarchical species when the pathogen is highly transmissible. In contrast, highly transmissible pathogens cause frequent and prolonged epidemic outbreaks in gregarious species. We evaluate the implications of network organization across social systems despite methodological challenges, and our findings offer new perspective on the debate about the disease costs of group living. Additionally, our study demonstrates the potential of meta‐analytic methods in social network analysis to test ecological and evolutionary hypotheses on cooperation, group living, communication and resilience to extrinsic pressures.

AB  - Fission–fusion social dynamics are common among a number of vertebrate taxa, and yet the factors shaping these variable associations among subgroup members have not been widely addressed. Associations may occur simply because of shared habitat preferences; however, social ties may also be influenced by genetic relatedness (kinship) or social attraction. Here, we investigate the association patterns of wild black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata , in Ranomafana National Park, Madagascar using behavioural, spatial (home range) and genetic data from 24 individually identified animals. We collected 40 840 records of group composition over a 17-month period and from this calculated pairwise association indices. We also used ranging coordinates and genetic samples to estimate patterns of spatial overlap and kinship, and then related these measures to patterns of affiliation. From these analyses, we found that dyadic ruffed lemur social associations were generally sparse and weak, that home range overlap was minimal and that average relatedness within the community was low. We found no evidence that kinship was related to patterns of either spatial overlap or social association; instead, associations were primarily driven by space use. Moreover, social preferences were unrelated to kinship. While home range overlap explained most of the variation seen in social association, some variation remained unaccounted for, suggesting that other social, ecological and biological factors such as shared resource defence or communal breeding might also play a role in social attraction. Our results further highlight the need to consider individual space use and nuances of species behaviour when investigating social preference and social association more generally. • We examined social association, spatial overlap and relatedness in ruffed lemurs. • We found weak social association, low pairwise relatedness and little spatial overlap. • Relatedness was not correlated with social association or social preference. • Social association was instead strongly related to space use. • Other factors are likely to account for some of the variation in social association.

AB  - Social network analysis has been postulated as a tool to study potential pathogen transmission in wildlife but is resource‐intensive to quantify. Networks based on bacterial genotypes have been proposed as a cost‐effective method for estimating social or transmission network based on the assumption that individuals in close contact will share commensal bacteria. However, the use of network analysis to study wild populations requires critical evaluation of the assumptions and parameters these models are founded on.We test (a) whether networks of commensal bacterial sharing are related to hosts' social associations and hence could act as a proxy for estimating transmission networks, (b) how the parameters chosen to define host associations and delineate bacterial genotypes impact inference and (c) whether these relationships change across time. We use stochastic simulations to evaluate how uncertainty in parameter choice affects network structure.We focused on a well‐studied population of eastern grey kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), from Sundown National Park, Australia. Using natural markings, each individual was identified and its associations with other kangaroos recorded through direct field observations over 2 years to construct social networks. Faecal samples were collected, Escherichia coli was cultured and genotyped using BOX‐PCR, and bacterial networks were constructed. Two individuals were connected in the bacterial network if they shared at least one E. coli genotype. We determined the capacity of bacterial networks to predict the observed social network structure in each year.We found little support for a relationship between social association and dyadic commensal bacterial similarity. Thresholds to determine host associations and similarity cut‐off values used to define E. coli genotypes had important ramifications for inferring links between individuals. In fact, we found that inferences can show opposite patterns based on the chosen thresholds. Moreover, no similarity in overall bacterial network structure was detected between years.Although empirical disease transmission data are often unavailable in wildlife populations, both bacterial networks and social networks have limitations in representing the mode of transmission of a pathogen. Our results suggest that caution is needed when designing such studies and interpreting results. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Animal social networks are shaped by multiple selection pressures, including the need to ensure efficient communication and functioning while simultaneously limiting disease transmission. Social animals could potentially further reduce epidemic risk by altering their social networks in the presence of pathogens, yet there is currently no evidence forsuch pathogen-triggered responses. We tested this hypothesis experimentally in the ant Lasius niger using a combination of automated tracking, controlled pathogen exposure, transmission quantification, and temporally explicit simulations. Pathogen exposure induced behavioral changes in both exposed ants and their nestmates, which helped contain the disease by reinforcing key transmission-inhibitory properties of the colony’s contact network. This suggests that social network plasticity in response to pathogens is an effective strategy for mitigating the effects of disease in social groups. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The need to make fast decisions under risky and uncertain conditions is a widespread problem in the natural world. While there has been extensive work on how individual organisms dynamically modify their behavior to respond appropriately to changing environmental conditions (and how this is encoded in the brain), we know remarkably little about the corresponding aspects of collective information processing in animal groups. For example, many groups appear to show increased "sensitivity" in the presence of perceived threat, as evidenced by the increased frequency and magnitude of repeated cascading waves of behavioral change often observed in fish schools and bird flocks under such circumstances. How such context-dependent changes in collective sensitivity are mediated, however, is unknown. Here we address this question using schooling fish as a model system, focusing on 2 nonexclusive hypotheses: 1) that changes in collective responsiveness result from changes in how individuals respond to social cues (i.e., changes to the properties of the "nodes" in the social network), and 2) that they result from changes made to the structural connectivity of the network itself (i.e., the computation is encoded in the "edges" of the network). We find that despite the fact that perceived risk increases the probability for individuals to initiate an alarm, the context-dependent change in collective sensitivity predominantly results not from changes in how individuals respond to social cues, but instead from how individuals modify the spatial structure, and correspondingly the topology of the network of interactions, within the group. Risk is thus encoded as a collective property, emphasizing that in group-living species individual fitness can depend strongly on coupling between scales of behavioral organization.

AB  - Temporal lobe epilepsy is the most common drug-resistant form of epilepsy in adults. The reorganization of neural networks and the gene expression landscape underlying pathophysiologic network behavior in brain structures such as the hippocampus has been suggested to be controlled, in part, by microRNAs. To systematically assess their significance, we sequenced Argonaute-loaded microRNAs to define functionally engaged microRNAs in the hippocampus of three different animal models in two species and at six time points between the initial precipitating insult through to the establishment of chronic epilepsy. We then selected commonly up-regulated microRNAs for a functional in vivo therapeutic screen using oligonucleotide inhibitors. Argonaute sequencing generated 1.44 billion small RNA reads of which up to 82% were microRNAs, with over 400 unique microRNAs detected per model. Approximately half of the detected microRNAs were dysregulated in each epilepsy model. We prioritized commonly up-regulated microRNAs that were fully conserved in humans and designed custom antisense oligonucleotides for these candidate targets. Antiseizure phenotypes were observed upon knockdown of miR-10a-5p, miR-21a-5p, and miR-142a5p and electrophysiological analyses indicated broad safety of this approach. Combined inhibition of these three microRNAs reduced spontaneous seizures in epileptic mice. Proteomic data, RNA sequencing, and pathway analysis on predicted and validated targets of these microRNAs implicated derepressed TGF-β signaling as a shared seizure-modifying mechanism. Correspondingly, inhibition of TGFβ signaling occluded the antiseizure effects of the antagomirs. Together, these results identify shared, dysregulated, and functionally active microRNAs during the pathogenesis of epilepsy which represent therapeutic antiseizure targets [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Network theory increasingly informs wildlife conservation in disturbed landscapes, but with concern increasingly expressed about its application to real‐world situations. The theory predicts that the connectivity of scale‐free networks should be particularly sensitive to the disturbance of highly connected nodes (i.e. hubs). This expectation relies on complete patch removal, thus restraining its application to the last of several steps involved in habitat fragmentation, and overlooks potential reconnection of patches after disturbance (i.e. rewiring).We performed a landscape‐scale experiment to evaluate the robustness of scale‐free spatial networks of woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) to logging activity. We built caribou networks before and after disturbance using a mechanistic model of inter‐patch movements and differentiated networks disturbed in their hubs and non‐hubs. We applied a reaction–advection–diffusion model to networks before and after disturbance to account for the spatio‐temporal dynamics of caribou movement within the networks and anticipate their space use. We validated network and space‐use predictions using empirical estimates from GPS relocations of caribou. Using the validated predictions, we compared topological network measures before and after disturbance to quantify changes in connectivity within the networks according to the type of disturbed nodes (i.e. hubs or non‐hubs) and assessed space‐use reorganization. We used control networks, for which no disturbance occurred in the before–after timeframe of the study, in the latter analysis to get a baseline rate of change.Disturbances due to logging activity typically resulted in fragmentation and shrinkage instead of complete patch removal. Independently to the type of disturbed nodes, caribou rewired their network using remnant patches from the fragmentation process. Consequently, topological network measures generally did not differ between before and after disturbance, such that caribou networks displayed some robustness to logging activity due to the rewiring process.Space‐use reorganization was greater, however, when hubs were disturbed in comparison with non‐hubs and controls. Even though caribou rewired their networks, they revisited less patches after the disturbance of hubs.A naive application of network theory (i.e. without potential rewiring and using complete patch removal), to assess spatial network robustness, may be inappropriate during most steps of the fragmentation process because of the rewiring process. Indeed, network rewiring facilitated by the presence of remnant patches can enhance spatial network robustness, in comparison with no rewiring. In addition, species‐specific functional connectivity should be accounted for when anticipating the rewiring process and animal space use within disturbed networks.

AB  - Social relationships represent an adaptive behavioral strategy that can provide fitness benefits to individuals. Within mammalian societies, delphinids are known to form diverse grouping patterns and show a variety of social systems. However, how ecological and intrinsic factors have shaped the evolution of such diverse societies is still not well understood. In this study, we used photo-identification data and biopsy samples collected between March 2013 and October 2015 in Coffin Bay, a heterogeneous environment in South Australia, to investigate the social structure of southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis). Based on the data from 657 groups of dolphins, we used generalized affiliation indices, and applied social network and modularity methods to study affiliation patterns among individuals and investigate the potential presence of social communities within the population. In addition, we investigated genetic relatedness and kinship relationships within and between the communities identified. Modularity analysis revealed that the Coffin Bay population is structured into 2 similar sized, mixed-sex communities which differed in ranging patterns, affiliation levels and network metrics. Lagged association rates also indicated that nonrandom affiliations persisted over the study period. The genetic analyses suggested that there was higher relatedness, and a higher proportion of inferred full-sibs and half-sibs, within than between communities. We propose that differences in environmental conditions between the bays and kinship relationships are important factors contributing to the delineation and maintenance of this social structure.

AB  - Deforestation has detrimental consequences on biodiversity, affecting species interactions at multiple scales. The associations among vertebrates, pathogens and their commensal/symbiotic microbial communities (i.e. microbiomes) have important downstream effects for biodiversity conservation, yet we know little about how deforestation contributes to changes in host microbial diversity and pathogen abundance. Here, we tested the effects of landcover, forest connectivity and infection by the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) on amphibian skin bacterial diversity along deforestation gradients in Brazilian landscapes. If disturbance to natural habitat alters skin microbiomes as it does in vertebrate host communities, then we would expect higher host bacterial diversity in natural forest habitats. Bd infection loads are also often higher in these closed-canopy forests, which may in turn impact skin-associated bacterial communities. We found that forest corridors shaped composition of host skin microbiomes; high forest connectivity predicted greater similarity of skin bacterial communities among host populations. In addition, we found that host skin bacterial diversity and Bd loads increased towards natural vegetation. Because symbiotic bacteria can potentially buffer hosts from Bd infection, we also evaluated the bi-directional microbiome-Bd link but failed to find a significant effect of skin bacterial diversity reducing Bd infections. Although weak, we found support for Bd increasing bacterial diversity and/or for core bacteria dominance reducing Bd loads. Our research incorporates a critical element in the study of host microbiomes by linking environmental heterogeneity of landscapes to the host-pathogen-microbiome triangle. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Sows are socially unequal in the preferential association and aggression networks. • Socially prominent and influential sows identified in every behavioural network. • Degree centrality and betweenness centrality unstable at an individual level between preferential association networks. • Outdegree centrality unstable at an individual level between aggression networks. • Betweenness centrality stable at an individual level between aggression networks. Social network analysis has developed as a valid technique in animal behaviour; despite an increase in the number of social network research in this field, comparatively few studies have focused on commercial animals. This study investigated a dry breeding sow herd (average = 69) as a model species for identifying socially prominent sows, individuals engaging in significantly higher levels of direct interactions than their conspecifics and socially influential sows, individuals with significantly higher levels of indirect interactions than their conspecifics. Animals were frequently added and removed from the herd during the study, creating a dynamic unstable social environment. In total, 63 h of video observations were obtained over three production cycles. Each production cycle covered 21 days, and behavioural observations occurred on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 20, 21. The social network metrics of degree centrality (number of interactions), betweenness centrality (number of times an individual falls along the shortest path between two individuals) and centralisation (the extent to which a single individual dominates a network) were analysed to assess the stability of aggressive behaviour and preferential associations between production cycles. Preferential associations refer to lying behaviour <1 m from selected partners. Agonistic interactions included biting, thrusting, chasing and displacement behaviour. The results identified subgroup formations within the herd, based upon connectedness. Socially prominent and influential sows were identified within the subgroups, a result unaffected by low centralisation in the preferential association networks and substantial centralisation variance between the aggression networks. Sows quantified as socially prominent in the preferential association and aggression networks did not generally hold this position between production cycles, showing significant changes in degree centrality. Sows also demonstrated inconsistency in social influence in the preferential association networks, again with significant differences in betweenness centrality between production cycles. However, in the aggression networks, betweenness centrality was found to be a stable individual social network metric, with no significant changes in behaviour. Knowledge of the stability of social influence in the aggression networks could improve levels of agonistic interactions as it becomes possible to make predictions of future response to aid and inform intervention or management strategies. These findings highlight betweenness centrality as a powerful alternative tool that extends beyond the traditional methods of analysing dyadic interactions to identify critical animals.

AB  - The insular cortex (INS) is extensively connected to the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA), and both regions send convergent projections into the caudal lateral hypothalamus (LHA) encompassing the parasubthalamic nucleus (PSTN). However, the organization of the network between these structures has not been clearly delineated in the literature, although there has been an upsurge in functional studies related to these structures, especially with regard to the cognitive and psychopathological control of feeding. We conducted tract-tracing experiments from the INS and observed a pathway to the PSTN region that runs parallel to the canonical hyperdirect pathway from the isocortex to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) adjacent to the PSTN. In addition, an indirect pathway with a relay in the central amygdala was also observed that is similar in its structure to the classic indirect pathway of the basal ganglia that also targets the STN. C-Fos experiments showed that the PSTN complex reacts to neophobia and sickness induced by lipopolysaccharide or cisplatin. Chemogenetic (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs [DREADD]) inhibition of tachykininergic neurons (Tac1) in the PSTN revealed that this nucleus gates a stop “no-eat” signal to refrain from feeding when the animal is subjected to sickness or exposed to a previously unknown source of food. Therefore, our anatomical findings in rats and mice indicate that the INS-PSTN network is organized in a similar manner as the hyperdirect and indirect basal ganglia circuitry. Functionally, the PSTN is involved in gating feeding behavior, which is conceptually homologous to the motor no-go response of the adjacent STN. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Aim: To understand the population structure and its potential drivers at different spatial scales in a migratory bird, the black‐fronted tern (Chlidonias albostriatus), a specialist of the spatially and temporally dynamic environments of braided rivers. Location: New Zealand. Methods: We used a three‐pronged approach based on 17 microsatellites, two mitochondrial loci (cytochrome b/control region) and phenotypic data (head‐bill length, bill depth, wing length, weight). We determined large‐scale genetic structure throughout the whole breeding range (approx. 150,000 km2), calculated genetic divergence of breeding colonies and tested for isolation‐by‐distance between colonies. We investigated the level of fine‐scale genetic structure based on spatial autocorrelation analyses and assessed the presence of a body size cline based on phenotypic data. Lastly, we compared phenotypic divergence (PST) and the level of divergence by genetic drift (FST) among breeding colonies to test for underlying mechanisms of population differentiation. Results: Nuclear and mitochondrial DNA showed that across their range black‐fronted terns were effectively panmictic, with low genetic divergence between breeding colonies overall and no isolation‐by‐distance. However, at fine geographical scales black‐fronted terns accrued significant genetic structure for distances up to 75 km, primarily driven by males, indicating more frequent female dispersal. Furthermore, a phenotypic cline in accordance with Bergmann's rule was evident. PST exceeded FST in three traits, suggestive of local adaptation. Main conclusions: Significant fine‐scale structure can be present in highly mobile, specialist species while not affecting spatial structures at larger scales. Hence, methodologies applied to both whole landscapes and local scales are important to appropriately estimate connectivity in dynamic metapopulations and investigate the processes behind connectivity. Conservation management will need to include protecting currently uninhabited patches to facilitate natural colonization of suitable habitat. For black‐fronted terns, managing whole catchments throughout the entire breeding range would be preferable to managing single patches. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Network connectivity is a key feature of rivers that affects patterns and processes in lotic ecosystems. Few studies have considered how changes in river reach connectivity might affect ecosystem attributes at a whole river network scale. The use of population dynamics models of keystone species at a river network scale allows exploration of how the effects of altered natural connectivity patterns might propagate through a river network.In this study, we present a metapopulation model to estimate the spatial distribution of the population density of brown trout (Salmo trutta), an ecologically and socioeconomically important top predator, in a river network in northern Spain. The model accounts for the presence of barriers that limit longitudinal connectivity in upstream and downstream directions. The model estimates the spatial distribution of densities of three age‐classes (young‐of‐the‐year, juveniles, and adults) in all river reaches that make up the network based on topology, connectivity and population dynamics (e.g. age‐class specific mortality, spawning, age‐class dispersal, and spawning migration patterns).Seventy‐five percent of the modelled population densities fell within the 95% confidence intervals of the empirical data (84.6% for young‐of‐the‐year, 69.2% for juveniles, and 69.2% for adults) collected in 13 reaches. The simulated removal of all longitudinal barriers to migration in the river network (re‐naturalisation of the whole catchment) produced a modelled increase in brown trout density in the most downstream reaches of the river network and lowered fish densities in the upstream portion of the network when bias in juvenile and adult movement direction was assumed. Furthermore, the simulated removal of a single obstacle affected fish density even in distant tributaries.The proposed model is an appropriate tool for the evaluation of spatial patterns of brown trout density at a river network scale and for the assessment of the impact of altered connectivity. This might help simulate the results of management strategies regarding river connectivity and show where population decreases or increases could be expected, although empirical knowledge of overall trout movement in the studied river networks is required for drawing realistic scenarios.

AB  - The adaptive value of close social bonds and social networks has been demonstrated in a variety of vertebrate taxa. While the effect of predators on populations is well established, disturbance by humans is increasingly being identified as affecting the behaviour and reproductive success of animals and can have significant impacts on their survival. We used a concurrent analysis of two adjacent giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis populations in Kenya to determine whether human activities and high predation affected their social networks. One study site was a premier tourist destination with a high volume of human activity in the form of tourist traffic and lodge infrastructure, alongside a high density of lions which preferentially prey on giraffe calves; the other was a private wildlife conservancy with minimal human activity and no lion population. Giraffes in both networks showed preferred associations and avoidances of other individuals, which were independent of space use. Bond strength was lower in the population exposed to high levels of human activity and lions, and the network had lower density and clustering, and shorter path lengths, suggesting that it was more fragmented. We suggest that human activity and predator density may influence the patterns of social interactions in giraffes and highlight the importance of understanding the impact of tourism and management on the survival and success of wild animal populations.

AB  - Spatial scaling theory (SST) relates the physical structure of the environment to species coexistence and community assembly. Although SST is a recognized theory in ecology, few studies have evaluated its predictions, producing contradictory results and frequently failing to meet its assumptions. In addition, the 'risk predictions' of SST regarding an increase in species similarity with body size and the dependence of this pattern on the landscape and food fractal dimensions have not been evaluated. This study attempted to account for previous limitations, analyzing these predictions in coleopteran guilds that inhabit 18 temporary ponds. This metacommunity covers a large gradient of environmental variables, including food density, the landscape fractal dimension, the food fractal dimensions and other indicators of pond heterogeneity. Average similarity in carnivorous and herbivorous body sizes systematically increased with guild richness, fulfilling classical predictions of niche theory. Species similarity was associated with body size, but the association reverts from negative to positive as the landscape fractal dimension and heterogeneity increases, a pattern further supported by null model analyses. Several nonexclusive mechanisms may account for this pattern: 1) the body size‐dependent landscape perception, through which small animals detect more heterogeneity than larger animals; 2) the reaching of landscape limits by larger species, which prevents them from accessing novel largest clusters; 3) the large differences between the landscape and food fractal dimensions; and 4) the homogenization of the landscape when an integer fractal dimension is reached. These mechanisms may dictate that smaller organisms are more able to capitalize on heterogeneity or available resources than larger organisms, thus promoting increased similarity among smaller species. The presented results support the connection between landscape spatial structure and biodiversity and a mechanistic understanding of this connection from the SST. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) is reciprocally connected with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and although the MD has been implicated in a range of PFC-dependent cognitive functions (Watanabe and Funahashi, 2012; Mitchell and Chakraborty, 2013; Parnaudeau et ah, 2018), little is known about how MD neurons in the primate participate specifically in cognitive control, a capability that reflects the ability to use contextual information (such as a rule) to modify responses to environmental stimuli. To learn how the MD-PFC thalamocortical network is engaged to mediate forms of cognitive control that are selectively disrupted in schizophrenia, we trained male monkeys to perform a variant of the AX continuous performance task, which reliably measures cognitive control deficits in patients (Henderson et al., 2012) and used linear multielectrode arrays to record neural activity in the MD and PFC simultaneously. We found that the two structures made clearly different contributions to distributed processing for cognitive control: MD neurons were specialized for decision-making and response selection, whereas prefrontal neurons were specialized to preferentially encode the environmental state on which the decision was based. In addition, we observed that functional coupling between MD and PFC was strongest when the decision as to which of the two responses in the task to execute was being made. These findings delineate unique contributions of MD and PFC to distributed processing for cognitive control and characterized neural dynamics in this network associated with normative cognitive control performance.

AB  - Social substructure can influence pathogen transmission. Modularity measures the degree of social contact within versus between "communities" in a network, with increasing modularity expected to reduce transmission opportunities. We investigated how social substructure scales with network size and disease transmission. Using small-scale primate social networks, we applied seven community detection algorithms to calculate modularity and subgroup cohesion, defined as individuals' interactions within subgroups proportional to the network. We found larger networks were more modular with higher subgroup cohesion, but the association's strength varied by community detection algorithm and substructure measure. These findings highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate community detection algorithm for the question of interest, and if not possible, using multiple algorithms. Disease transmission simulations revealed higher modularity and subgroup cohesion resulted in fewer infections, confirming that social substructure has epidemiological consequences. Increased subdivision in larger networks could reflect constrained time budgets or evolved defences against disease risk. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In mammals, T cell development critically depends on the IL-7 cytokine signaling pathway. Here we describe the identification of the zebrafish ortholog of mammalian IL-7 based on chromosomal localization, deduced protein sequence, and expression patterns. To examine the biological role of il7 in teleosts, we generated an il7 allele lacking most of its coding exons using CRISPR/Cas9-based mutagenesis. il7-deficient animals are viable and exhibit no obvious signs of immune disorder. With respect to intrathymic T cell development, il7 deficiency is associated with only a mild reduction of thymocyte numbers, contrasting with a more pronounced impairment of T cell development in il7r-deficient fish. Genetic interaction studies between il7 and il7r mutants, and il7 and crlf2(tslpr) mutants suggest the contribution of additional, as-yet unidentified cytokines to intrathymic T cell development. Such activities were also ascertained for other cytokines, such as il2 and il15, collectively indicating that in contrast to the situation in mammals, T cell development in the thymus of teleosts is driven by a degenerate multicomponent network of γc cytokines; this explains why deficiencies of single components have little detrimental effect. In contrast, the dependence on a single cytokine in the mammalian thymus has catastrophic consequences in cases of congenital deficiencies in genes affecting the IL-7 signaling pathway. We speculate that the transition from a degenerate to a nonredundant cytokine network supporting intrathymic T cell development emerged as a consequence of repurposing evolutionarily ancient constitutive cytokine pathways for regulatory functions in the mammalian peripheral immune system.

AB  - Acidification of lakes and rivers, as a consequence of anthropogenic interference, can cause fundamental changes to biological and ecological processes. One of the main consequences of a reduction in water pH for aquatic organisms is the disruption of their chemosensory abilities, as the detection of chemical cues underpins a wide range of decision‐making processes; for example, a reduction to low pH has been shown to interfere with predator avoidance and the detection of foraging cues. Moreover, aquatic organisms are known to make widespread use of chemical information to inform their social behaviour, although we have a comparably poor understanding of how this is impacted by water acidification, especially their shoaling behaviour. Using a standard behavioural assay, we therefore investigated the impact of low water pH on the social interactions mediated by diet‐derived chemical cues in three‐spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus), by quantifying social behaviour in water that varied either experimentally or naturally in pH. In both cases, we predicted that association patterns would be disrupted by low pH conditions, as reduced pH has shown to interfere with the perception of chemical cues in other non‐social contexts. Consistent with this prediction, our results demonstrate that an acute, short‐term reduction in water pH caused a breakdown in the diet‐mediated social interaction patterns seen in more alkaline water, although, interestingly, the pattern of associations for fish tested in naturally acidic water was both more complex and in a direction that was precisely contrary to our predictions. Overall, the findings provide insights into the potential effects of an acute reduction in water pH on fish communication and social interaction patterns, which may have implication for various individual, group, population and community‐level processes.

AB  - Protected areas are central to biodiversity conservation. For marine fish, marine protected areas (MPAs) often harbour more individuals, especially of species targeted by fisheries. But precise pathways of biodiversity change remain unclear. For example, how local‐scale responses combine to affect regional biodiversity, important for managing spatial networks of MPAs, is not well known. Protection potentially influences three components of fish assemblages that determine how species accumulate with sampling effort and spatial scale: the total number of individuals, the relative abundance of species and within‐species aggregation. Here, we examined the contributions of each component to species richness changes inside MPAs as a function of spatial scale.Using standardized underwater visual survey data, we measured the abundance and species richness of reef fishes in 43 protected and 41 fished sites in the Mediterranean Sea.At both local and regional scales, increased species evenness caused by added common species in MPAs compared to fished sites was the most important proximate driver of higher diversity.Site‐to‐site variation in the composition (i.e. β‐diversity) of common species was also higher among protected sites, and depended on sensitivity to exploitation. There were more abundant exploited species at regional scales than at local scales, reflecting a tendency for different protected sites to harbour different exploited species. In contrast, fewer abundant unexploited species were found at the regional scale than at the local scale, meaning that relative abundances at the regional scale were less even than at the local scale.Synthesis and applications. Although marine protected areas (MPAs) are known to strongly influence fish community abundance and biomass, we found that changes to the relative abundance of species (i.e. increased evenness) dominated the biodiversity response to protection. MPAs had more relatively common species, which in turn led to higher diversity for a given sampling effort. Moreover, higher β‐diversity of common species meant that local‐scale responses were magnified at the regional scale due to site‐to‐site variation inside protected areas for exploited species. Regional conservation efforts can be strengthened by examining how multiple components of biodiversity respond to protection across spatial scales. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A major question for understanding the ecology of parasite infections and diseases in wildlife populations concerns the transmission pathways among hosts. Network models are increasingly used to model the transmission of infections among hosts – however, few studies have integrated host behaviour and genetic relatedness of the parasites transmitted between hosts. In a study of the Australian sleepy lizard Tiliqua rugosa and its three‐host ixodid tick (Bothriocroton hydrosauri), we asked if patterns of genetic relatedness among ticks were best explained by spatial proximity or the host transmission network. Using synchronous GPS locations of over 50 adult lizards at 10 min intervals across the three‐month activity period, over 2 years, we developed two alternative parasite transmission networks. One alternative was based on the spatial proximity of lizards (at the centre of their home ranges), and the other was based on the frequency of asynchronous shared refuge use between pairs of lizards. In each year, adult ticks were removed from lizards and their genotypes were determined at four polymorphic microsatellite loci. Adult ticks collected from the same host were more related to each other than ticks from different hosts. Similarly, adult ticks collected from different lizards had a higher relatedness if those lizards had a shorter path length connecting them on each of the two networks we explored. The predictors of tick relatedness differed between years. In the first year, the asynchronous shared refuges network was the stronger predictor of tick relatedness, whereas in year two, the spatial proximity‐based network was the stronger predictor of tick relatedness. We speculate on how changing environmental conditions might change the relative importance of alternative processes driving the transmission of parasites. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA) has become a widely used tool to detect and quantify social learning in animal populations. NBDA infers social learning if the spread of a novel behavior follows the social network and hence relies on appropriate information on individuals' network connections. Most studies on animal populations, however, lack a complete record of all associations, which creates uncertainty in the social network. To reduce this uncertainty, researchers often use a certain threshold of sightings for the inclusion of animals (which is often arbitrarily chosen), as observational error decreases with increasing numbers of observations. Dropping individuals with only few sightings, however, can lead to information loss in the network if connecting individuals are removed. Hence, there is a trade-off between including as many individuals as possible and having reliable data. We here provide a tool in R that assesses the sensitivity of NBDA to error in the social network given a certain threshold for the inclusion of individuals. It simulates a social learning process through a population and then tests the power of NBDA to reliably detect social learning after introducing observational error into the social network, which is repeated for different thresholds. Our tool can help researchers using NBDA to select a threshold, specific to their data set, that maximizes power to reliably quantify social learning in their study population.

AB  - Numerous studies have observed kin-biased social associations in a variety of species. Many of these studies have focused on species exhibiting parental care, which may facilitate the transmission of the social environment from parents to offspring. This becomes problematic when disentangling whether kin-biased associations are driven by kin recognition, or are a product of transmission of the social environment during ontogeny, or a combination of both. Studying kin-biased associations in systems that lack parental care may aid in addressing this issue. Furthermore, when studying kin-biased social associations, it is important to differentiate whether these originate from preferential choice or occur randomly as a result of habitat use or limited dispersal. Here, we combined high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism data with a long-term behavioral data set of a reptile with no parental care to demonstrate that eastern water dragons (Intellagama lesueurii) bias their nonrandom social associations toward their kin. In particular, we found that although the overall social network was not linked to genetic relatedness, individuals associated with kin more than expected given availability in space and also biased social preferences toward kin. This result opens important opportunities for the study of kinship-driven associations without the confounding effect of vertical transmission of social environments. Furthermore, we present a robust multiple-step approach for determining whether kin-biased social associations are a result of active social decisions or random encounters resulting from habitat use and dispersal patterns.

AB  - Network metrics are widely used to infer the roles of mutualistic animals in plant communities and to predict the effect of species' loss. However, their empirical validation is scarce. Here we parameterized a joint species model of frugivory and seed dispersal with bird movement and foraging data from tropical and temperate communities. With this model, we investigate the effect of frugivore loss on seed rain, and compare our predictions to those of standard coextinction models and network metrics. Topological coextinction models underestimated species loss after the removal of highly linked frugivores with unique foraging behaviours. Network metrics informed about changes in seed rain quantity after frugivore loss. However, changes in seed rain composition were only predicted by partner diversity. Nestedness, closeness, and d' specialisation could not anticipate the effects of rearrangements in plant–frugivore communities following species loss. Accounting for behavioural differences among mutualists is critical to improve predictions from network models. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Highlights • Matriline fragmentation is associated with more grooming communities, severe aggression and high rates of trauma. • Unrelated adult males with high social power police third party conflict stabilizing macaque social groups. • High ranking natal males disrupt the social power networks of unrelated males causing higher aggression in social groups. • Proactive management of the three major pathways can lead to greater social stability in macaque social groups. Abstract Biomedical facilities across the nation and worldwide aim to develop cost-effective methods for the reproductive management of macaque breeding groups, typically by housing macaques in large, multi-male multi-female social groups that provide monkey subjects for research as well as appropriate socialization for their psychological well-being. One of the most difficult problems in managing socially housed macaques is their propensity for deleterious aggression. From a management perspective, deleterious aggression (as opposed to less intense aggression that serves to regulate social relationships) is undoubtedly the most problematic behavior observed in group-housed macaques, which can readily escalate to the degree that it causes social instability, increases serious physical trauma leading to group dissolution, and reduces psychological well-being. Thus for both welfare and other management reasons, aggression among rhesus macaques at primate centers and facilities needs to be addressed with a more proactive approach.Management strategies need to be instituted that maximize social housing while also reducing problematic social aggression due to instability using efficacious methods for detection and prevention in the most cost effective manner. Herein we review a new proactive approach using social network analysis to assess and predict deleterious aggression in macaque groups. We discovered three major pathways leading to instability, such as unusually high rates and severity of trauma and social relocations.These pathways are linked either directly or indirectly to network structure in rhesus macaque societies. We define these pathways according to the key intrinsic and extrinsic variables (e.g., demographic, genetic or social factors) that influence network and behavioral measures of stability (see Fig. 1). They are: (1) presence of natal males, (2) matrilineal genetic fragmentation, and (3) the power structure and conflict policing behavior supported by this power structure. We discuss how these three major pathways leading to greater understanding and predictability of deleterious aggression in macaque social groups. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Highlights • Networks were generated based on risk behaviours for Leptospira transmission. • Social networks were shaped by both individual attributes and structural properties. • Consideration of cattle heterogeneous contact structure may improve animal health. Abstract A better comprehension of cattle contact structure can enhance the prevention of the transmission of infectious agents within livestock farms. Social network analysis has proven to provide a more accurate picture of social structures than traditional methods. In this study, we focused on leptospirosis, a zoonosis of global importance caused by pathogenic strains of Leptospira spp. that can be transmitted directly between animals. We hypothesized that contact patterns between dairy cattle of the same group are influenced by individual cow attributes and structural properties of the social network. We worked with a milking cow group (n = 170) and two weaned calf groups of different ages (both n = 33) kept in pasture-based systems. We focused on three contact behaviours that may lead to transmission of pathogenic Leptospira spp.: sniffing, licking and rubbing the face on the genital area of another animal. The occurrence of these behaviours was directly observed and recorded for three weeks in lactating cows and four weeks in weaned calves. Based on those observations, we created social networks and used exponential random graph models to estimate the probability of contact between the animals based on individual covariates (cows: parity number, age, reproductive status, and entrance time into the group; calves: sex, age and entrance time) and structural effects. Despite most of the individuals in each group being either directly or indirectly connected, networks were extremely sparse. Most animals were involved in few contacts; however, some individuals had a very high degree of interaction (mainly cows in oestrus and male calves). Those highly connected individuals could play a key role during outbreaks. There was negative age heterophily (OR = 0.92, p < 0.001), meaning that cows interacted mainly with cows of the same age. Male calves were significantly more likely to start contacts than females (CALF1 group: OR = 3.79, p < 0.001; CALF2 group: OR = 7.71, p < 0.001). This study provides evidence that social interactions in dairy cattle are heterogeneous and highlights the importance of specific individual attributes in the formation of the contact structure of a group. Considering the contact structure within groups might facilitate the design of more efficient surveillance systems and mitigation strategies to prevent or reduce the transmission of infectious agents in dairy farms.

AB  - Bayesian network analyses can be used to interactively change the strength of effect of variables in a model to explore complex relationships in new ways. In doing so, they allow one to identify influential nodes that are not well studied empirically so that future research can be prioritized. We identified relationships in host and pathogen biology to examine disease-driven declines of amphibians associated with amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). We constructed a Bayesian network consisting of behavioral, genetic, physiological, and environmental variables that influence disease and used them to predict host population trends. We varied the impacts of specific variables in the model to reveal factors with the most influence on host population trend. The behavior of the nodes (the way in which the variables probabilistically responded to changes in states of the parents, which are the nodes or variables that directly influenced them in the graphical model) was consistent with published results. The frog population had a 49% probability of decline when all states were set at their original values, and this probability increased when body temperatures were cold, the immune system was not suppressing infection, and the ambient environment was conducive to growth of B. dendrobatidis. These findings suggest the construction of our model reflected the complex relationships characteristic of host-pathogen interactions. Changes to climatic variables alone did not strongly influence the probability of population decline, which suggests that climate interacts with other factors such as the capacity of the frog immune system to suppress disease. Changes to the adaptive immune system and disease reservoirs had a large effect on the population trend, but there was little empirical information available for model construction. Our model inputs can be used as a base to examine other systems, and our results show that such analyses are useful tools for reviewing existing literature, identifying links poorly supported by evidence, and understanding complexities in emerging infectious-disease systems.

AB  - Increasing the connectivity of protected areas is an urgent need to ensure the conservation of forest species and help them to shift their ranges due to anthropogenic drivers. However, efforts to do so considering the joint effects of habitat fragmentation and climate change are still scant. Here, we aimed to outline a framework that incorporates spatial, temporal and multi-taxa criteria to pinpoint locations that connect protected areas in the eastern Amazon. We analyzed three mosaics of protected areas, and data on 603 species (bees, birds, bats) and developed two models using species movement flow (MF; through circuit theory) and habitat suitability (HS; through species distribution models). Considering only the MF, northward areas are the main candidates for corridors, most of which presenting forest cover (68% of the 928,379 ha). This result changes when we analyze the HS, since the corridors are mostly positioned in a different direction (westward) and less than half have forest cover (45% of the 925,058 ha). Candidate areas for both approaches totaled 135,171 ha, with 86% still covered by forest. Our results rely on methodological and taxonomic redundancy (to depict a range of movement and/or habitat requirements) for an efficient strategy to prioritize areas for connectivity. Dynamic restoration simulations showed that the location and order of restoration are important to ensure increased availability of habitat. Our approach can help address two important biodiversity threats (habitat loss and climate change) and maximize the selection of the best corridors to protect species in a rapidly changing world. • Increasing connectivity between protected areas is urgent to promote conservation • Corridors rely on landscape structure, climate change and species dispersal ability • We offer a useful approach for local initiatives aiming to protect tropical forests • Our approach uses the best available data and is flexible to refinement [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Understanding the consequences of losing individuals from wild populations is a current and pressing issue, yet how such loss influences the social behaviour of the remaining animals is largely unexplored. Through combining the automated tracking of winter flocks of over 500 wild great tits (Parus major) with removal experiments, we assessed how individuals' social network positions responded to the loss of their social associates. We found that the extent of flockmate loss that individuals experienced correlated positively with subsequent increases in the number of their social associations, the average strength of their bonds and their overall connectedness within the social network (defined as summed edge weights). Increased social connectivity was not driven by general disturbance or changes in foraging behaviour, but by modifications to fine-scale social network connections in response to losing their associates. Therefore, the reduction in social connectedness expected by individual loss may be mitigated by increases in social associations between remaining individuals. Given that these findings demonstrate rapid adjustment of social network associations in response to the loss of previous social ties, future research should examine the generality of the compensatory adjustment of social relations in ways that maintain the structure of social organization.

AB  - Social network models provide a powerful tool to estimate infection risk for individual hosts and track parasite transmission through host populations. Here, bringing together concepts from social network theory, animal personality, and parasite manipulation of host behaviour, I argue that not only are social networks shaping parasite transmission, but parasites in turn shape social networks through their effects on the behaviour of infected individuals. Firstly, I review five general categories of behaviour (mating behaviour, aggressiveness, activity levels, spatial distribution, and group formation) that are closely tied to social networks, and provide evidence that parasites can affect all of them. Secondly, I describe scenarios in which behaviour-altering parasites can modify either the role or position of individual hosts within their social network, or various structural properties (e.g., connectance, modularity) of the entire network. Experimental approaches allowing comparisons of social networks pre- versus post-infection are a promising avenue to explore the feedback loop between social networks and parasite infections.

AB  - Mating strategy and social behavior influence gene flow and hence affect levels of genetic differentiation and potentially speciation. Previous genetic analyses of closely related plovers Charadrius spp. found strikingly different population genetic structure in Madagascar: Kittlitz's plovers are spatially homogenous whereas white-fronted plovers have well segregated and geographically distinct populations. Here, we test the hypotheses that Kittlitz's plovers are spatially interconnected and have extensive social interactions that facilitate gene flow, whereas white-fronted plovers are spatially discrete and have limited social interactions. By experimentally removing mates from breeding pairs and observing the movements of mate-searching plovers in both species, we compare the spatial behavior of Kittlitz's and white-fronted plovers within a breeding season. The behavior of experimental birds was largely consistent with expectations: Kittlitz's plovers travelled further, sought new mates in larger areas, and interacted with more individuals than white-fronted plovers, however there was no difference in breeding dispersal. These results suggest that mating strategies, through spatial behavior and social interactions, are predictors of gene flow and thus genetic differentiation and speciation. Our study highlights the importance of using social behavior to understand gene flow. However, further work is needed to investigate the relative importance of social structure, as well as intra- and inter-season dispersal, in influencing the genetic structures of populations.

AB  - There are many factors that may explain why cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) strand. Around the UK and Ireland, over 20,000 stranding records have been collected since 1913, resulting in one of the longest, continuous, systematic stranding data sets in the world. We use this data set to investigate temporal and spatial trends in cetacean strandings and use generalized additive models (GAMs) to investigate correlates of strandings. We find a dramatic increase in strandings since the 1980s, most likely due to increases in recording effort, and the formation of formal strandings networks. We found no correlation between the numbers of cetaceans stranding each year and several potential environmental and anthropogenic predictors: storms, geomagnetic activity, North Atlantic Oscillations, sea‐surface temperature, and fishing catch. We suggest that this is because the scale of change in the variables is too coarse to detect any potential correlations. It may also highlight the idiosyncratic nature of species' responses to external pressures, and further the need to investigate other potential correlates of strandings, such as bycatch and military sonar. Long‐term cetacean stranding data provide vital information on past and present diversity for common, rare, and inconspicuous species. This study underlines the importance of continued support for stranding networks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Nonhuman primates host a variety of gastrointestinal parasites that infect individuals through different transmission routes. Social contact among group members (e.g., body contact, grooming) brings the risk of parasite infection, especially when the pathogen infection is directly transmitted. Along with this, accidental provisioning (i.e., food provisioning occurring during close tourist–wildlife interactions) is also considered to increase the risk of infection, as aggregation during feeding can cause higher exposure to parasite infective stages. However, while some attention has been paid to the relationship between social behavior and parasites, the link between accidental food provisioning and characteristics of parasite infection in primates has thus far received less attention. This study examines the potential effect of accidental provisioning on patterns of inter-individual spatial association, and in turn on parasite infection risk in a wild group of black capuchin monkeys (Sapajus nigritus) in Iguazú National Park, Argentina. To do so, we simulated events of accidental provisioning via researcher-managed provisioning experiments and tested whether experimental provisioning affects the inter-individual spatial distribution within groups. In addition, we determined whether patterns of parasite infection were better predicted by naturally occurring spatial networks (i.e., spatial association during natural observations) or by provisioning spatial networks (i.e., spatial interactions during experimental provisioning). We found a significant increase in network centrality that was potentially associated with an overall increase in individual connections with other group members during experimental trials. However, when assessing the effects of natural and provisioning network metrics on parasite characteristics, we did not observe a significant effect of centrality measures (i.e., closeness and betweenness) on parasite richness and single infection by Filariopsis sp. Taken together, our findings suggest that alterations of within-group spatial networks due to accidental provisioning may have a limited influence in determining the characteristics of parasite infections in black capuchin monkeys.

AB  - Understanding the drivers of sociality is a major goal in biology. Individual differences in social connections determine the overall group structure and have consequences for a variety of processes, including if and when individuals acquire information from conspecifics. Effects in the opposite direction, where information acquisition and transmission have consequences for social connections, are also likely to be widespread. However, these effects are typically overlooked. We propose that individuals who successfully learn about their environment become valuable social partners and become highly connected, leading to feedback-based dynamic relationships between social connections and information transmission. These dynamics have the potential to change our understanding of social evolution, including how selection acts on behavior and how sociality influences population-level processes. Animal social relationships are characterized by nonrandom associations and interactions that play a major role in survival and fitness, by influencing foraging decisions, space use, predator avoidance, and mate choice. Social network analysis, a powerful framework for addressing the causes and the consequences of social variation, is generating substantial evidence for the idea that sociality drives information transmission, where individuals' social connections influence if and when they learn novel information from others. However, a causal relationship in the other direction, where learning and information transmission influence individuals' social value and thus affect social connections, is rarely addressed. We need to account for the feedback-based dynamic relationships between learning and social connections when investigating how information spreads through networks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The nonlinearity and fear hypothesis predicts that the structure of alarm vocalizations will be influenced by the signaller's internal state. Specifically, stressed or otherwise more aroused individuals will produce alarm calls that are relatively more nonlinear (i.e. they sound noisier). The position of an individual in a social network can influence an individual's sense of security. More centrally located individuals may feel more secure and thus we might expect that they would produce noisier calls. Building on previous research about the influence of social relationships on an individual's sense of security, we asked whether social network position explained variation in the noisiness (quantified as Wiener entropy) and goodness of pitch of alarm calls produced by trapped yellow-bellied marmots, Marmota flaviventer. More socially isolated individuals, characterized by lower outstrength, produced alarm calls with higher entropy and higher goodness of pitch. These isolated individuals may be more aroused because they have fewer social partners to depend on when presented with a predatory threat; therefore, they produce both noisy and potentially louder calls. Additionally, individuals with higher outcloseness produced calls with higher goodness of pitch, which may be indicative of their ability to better inform neighbours of impending threats. Overall, this study further illustrates how an individual's social network position influences the structure of its alarm calls, which could reflect how individuals perceive their current safety levels. • Alarm call structure is affected by an individual's social network position. • Socially isolated marmots (lower outstrength) produce noisier alarm calls. • Social relationships may influence how individuals perceive their safety.

AB  - Abstract: Movement is a key process driving animal distributions within heterogeneous landscapes. Graph (network) theory is increasingly used to understand and predict landscape functional connectivity, as network properties can provide crucial information regarding the resilience of a system to landscape disturbances, e.g. removal of habitat patches. The temporal dimension of movement patterns, however, is not generally included in network analysis, which can lead to a discrepancy between observed space use and landscape connectivity. Reaction–advection–diffusion models, when coupled with network analysis, could provide a powerful mechanistic framework based upon spatio‐temporal dimensions of animal movement, but this approach remains poorly developed for ecological studies. We developed a mechanistic space use model that considers both residency time in resource patches and movement amongst those patches within a spatial network. The framework involves two main steps: first, the network topology that best reflects functional connectivity for the study system is identified; second, a spatio‐temporal flow dynamic is implemented within the network using reaction–advection–diffusion modelling. To illustrate the approach, we used observations of radiocollared plains bison <italic>Bison bison bison</italic> that were travelling in a meadow network within a forest matrix. In the model application, we found that the graph best reflecting the functional connectivity of bison was a complex graph of ultra‐small world scale‐free network type. The reaction–advection–diffusion model involved the effect of meadow area and inter‐meadow distance on bison travels. Simulations showed that a simple graph or distance‐based graphs provided less accurate predictions of bison distribution, while also predicting different management actions to effectively impact bison space use. Our study demonstrates how reaction–advection–diffusion modelling, coupled with network theory, can provide a robust mechanistic framework for predicting animal distribution in dynamic environments. The modelling approach can be applied to a large range of systems that are subjected to rapid environmental changes due to habitat management or natural resource extraction, for example. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that management and conservation planning can strongly depend upon network structure, and that a faulty assessment of network topology can result in poor planning, with potential unexpected impacts on animal distributions.

AB  - The remarkable ecological success of social insects is often attributed to their advanced division of labor, which is closely associated with temporal polyethism in which workers transition between different tasks as they age. Young nurses are typically found deep within the nest where they tend to the queen and the brood, whereas older foragers are found near the entrance and outside the nest. <sup>1–3</sup> However, the individual-level maturation dynamics remain poorly understood because following individuals over relevant timescales is difficult; hence, previous experimental studies used same-age cohort designs. <sup>4–15</sup> To address this, we used an automated tracking system to follow >500 individuals over >100 days and constructed networks of physical contacts to provide a continuous measure of worker social maturity. These analyses revealed that most workers occupied one of two steady states, namely a low-maturity nurse state and a high-maturity forager state, with the remaining workers rapidly transitioning between these states. There was considerable variation in the age at transition, and, surprisingly, the transition probability was age independent. This suggests that the transition is largely stochastic rather than a hard-wired age-dependent physiological change. Despite the variation in timing, the transition dynamics were highly stereotyped. Transitioning workers moved from the nurse to the forager state according to an S-shaped trajectory, and only began foraging after completing the transition. Stochastic switching, which occurs in many other biological systems, may provide ant colonies with robustness to extrinsic perturbations by allowing the colony to decouple its division of labor from its demography. • Continuous tracking of ant workers for 5 months shows long-term behavioral changes • Analysis of daily contact networks reveals workers belong to two steady states • Maturing workers follow a stereotyped S-shaped trajectory as they change state • The timing of the transition is independent of age; hence, maturation is stochastic Richardson et al. use an automated ant tracking system to study long-term behavioral development of worker ants. Most workers occupy one of two steady states, and maturating workers exhibit a rapid S-shaped transition from one state to the other. The timing of the transition is independent of worker age; hence, maturation appears to be stochastic. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Context: Dispersal plays a key role in linking populations, habitat (re)-colonization, and species range expansion. As fragmentation and habitat loss are ubiquitous threats and can disrupt dispersal, landscape connectivity modeling has become a valuable tool in conservation planning. Objectives: We provide an overview of how current connectivity modeling has incorporated the different aspects of animal dispersal. We describe the most popular connectivity models and highlight their main assumptions related to dispersal, suggesting a series of questions that could clarify the advantages and disadvantages of using a particular approach. Methods: We review the structure of the connectivity models based on least-cost analysis, circuit theory, and the individual-based dispersal models. We use some studies as case examples to discuss how important elements of animal dispersal were considered through models to predict movement routes. Results: Ongoing developments in connectivity modeling have made it possible to represent animal dispersal in a more realistic way by implementing key elements such as dispersal behaviors, mortality, and inter-individual variability. However, the potential to consider such elements and how this is done in connectivity modeling depends on the selected approach, since each model represents animal dispersal through a different perspective. Conclusions: We recommend that the choice of a connectivity model should be made after considering the study objectives, the species dispersal mechanism, and the prior knowledge available about it. By understanding and incorporating dispersal behavior into connectivity modeling, we can improve our capacity to generate useful information aimed to construct more effective conservation strategies.

AB  - Highlights • European bison belonging to the same matriline are closely associated within the group. • No group member has a higher social centrality than the other individuals. • The Sociability variable is not correlated to age, dominance or the number of matrilineal relatives. • The higher Sociability value of lactating females is indirectly caused by the gregarious behaviour of their calves. • Matrilineal relationships must be considered in herd management decisions. Abstract The use of social network analysis to better understand animal behaviour has led to an increase in the number of studies on this topic, particularly for species management and conservation as well as the welfare of captive animals. The current knowledge of social organization in the European bison (Bison bonasus) is still largely based on descriptions of group compositions, most of which were obtained during opportunistic field observations. However, the numerous conservation programs for this species can only implement effective management decisions after the analysis of its social structures. For instance, the removal of a key individual can disturb the social stability of a group and thus indirectly affect the fitness of group members. This is the first study that uses social network analysis to examine the social structure of a semi-free ranging bison herd (N = 14). Closest neighbour associations are used to calculate the eigenvector centrality and individual social strength of each animal. These two indices are combined after a principal component analysis (PCA) to form the Sociability variable, which was then tested for correlations with age, dominance rank, number of matrilines and reproductive status (lactating vs non-lactating). Results reveal strong group cohesion, with a close association of individuals belonging to the same matriline within the herd. The cumulative distribution of the eigenvector centralities follows a linear function, meaning that no individual has a highly central position compared to its congeners. Finally, a high Sociability value was not correlated to age, dominance rank or number of matrilines, but was dependent on the reproductive status of females. These results indicate the necessity to consider the social welfare of animals, for instance by taking matrilineal relationships into account when making bison groups management decisions.

AB  - Highlights • An archipelagic landscape ecological network (ALEN) was established at dual spatial scales. • The ALEN consisted of four types of elements: nodes, routes, sources, and corridors. • Methods of Euclidean distance and Least cost distance were integrated to establish the ALEN. • ALEN in Miaodao Archipelago realized full connectivity across archipelago and island scales. • Optimization measures based on the landscape structure of the ALEN were proposed. Abstract An archipelagic landscape ecological network (ALEN) is important for optimizing the bird migration route and providing reference for island biodiversity maintenance. The ALEN with full connectivity at dual spatial scales was established in this study. Ecological nodes and routes at archipelago scale, as well as ecological sources and corridors at island scale, were identified to constitute the ALEN based on the habitat suitability and integrating the approaches of Euclidean distance and Least cost distance. Then, the landscape structures of the ALEN were analyzed and the optimization measures were proposed to improve the habitat quality and network connectivity. Miaodao Archipelago, an important and typical archipelago in North China, was selected as the study area. Results indicated that the ALEN was composed of 32 nodes and 81 routes at archipelago scale, and 42 sources and 76 corridors at island scale. At archipelago scale, the ecological efficiency of the ALEN was determined by the landscape resistance and position of different islands, and the landscape structure optimization should focus on the islands that involved the indispensable routes. At island scale, the number and spatial distribution of the sources, as well as the landscape structure of the corridors, contributed the most to the ecological efficiency. More ecological sources with uniform distribution should be added, and the corridor width of 50 m was practical to implement the ALEN. The ALEN realized the full connectivity, that is, the bird species could flow (flight or walk) all over the nodes and sources along the routes and corridors across the dual spatial scales, and the balance of efficiency and cost was achieved. The ALEN could be widely applied in different archipelagos with distinct ecological functions and external disturbances. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The dynamic nature of animal societies often hides multiple layers of complexity. The field of animal behaviour is rapidly advancing with the development of increasingly sophisticated analytical methods that allow scientists to identify complex and nuanced drivers of social patterns. The resurgent interest in giraffe sociality illustrates this by challenging the early view that individuals interact at random; it became clear that, instead, giraffes can be organized into multilevel societies, apparently founded on preferred associations. However, it is unclear whether such enduring associations result from active choice for specific individuals. The extent to which other social and asocial factors can contribute to an individual's inclusion in groups remains underexplored. Here we assess how context affects social preferences at the individual level by evaluating grouping patterns of giraffes in different behavioural states, habitats and levels of disturbance. When we controlled for potential class-based (as opposed to individual-based) assortment of individuals by sex, age and gregariousness, we found that giraffes only exhibited individual social preferences when foraging, with minor influence of habitat complexity or level of disturbance. Our results indicate that behavioural context is a major driver of giraffe social association. This strengthens recent evidence of complex social systems in giraffes and suggests that classic metrics of social relationships (such as association indices) may be too coarse, concealing true social preferences in wild populations. Highlights • Behavioural context is a major driver of social associations in giraffes. • Giraffes only exhibit social preferences when foraging. • Habitat complexity and predation risk had minor influences on association patterns. • Social preferences may be driven by females' selection of foraging companions. • Accounting for behavioural context can reveal true social preferences among animals.

AB  - Animal‐focused research has been crucial for scientific advancement, but rodents are still taking a starring role. Starting as merely supporting evidence found in rodents, the use of fish models has slowly taken a more central role and expanded its overall contributions in areas such as social sciences, evolution, physiology and recently in translational medical research. In the neurosciences, zebrafish Danio rerio have been widely adopted, contributing to our understanding of the genetic control of brain processes and the effects of pharmacological manipulations. However, discussion continues regarding the paradox of function versus structure, when fishes and mammals are compared and on the potentially evolutionarily conserved nature of behaviour across fish species. From a behavioural standpoint, we explore aversive–stress and social behaviour in selected fish models and refer to the extensive contributions of stress and monoaminergic systems. We suggest that, in spite of marked neuroanatomical differences between fishes and mammals, stress and sociality are conserved at the behavioural and molecular levels. We also suggest that stress and sociality are mediated by monoamines in predictable and non‐trivial ways and that monoamines could bridge the relationship between stress and social behaviour. To reconcile the level of divergence with the level of similarity, we need neuroanatomical, pharmacological, behavioural and ecological studies conducted in the laboratory and in nature. These areas need to add to each other to enhance our understanding of fish behaviour and ultimately how this all may lead to better model systems for translational studies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Although play is seen in many species, its evolutionary function is still largely unknown. Several relevant, proposed hypotheses (such as the training for the unexpected, self-assessment, social skills, and dominance hierarchy hypotheses) make predictions about how animals should optimally choose their play partners based on their familiarity or other demographic variables. We used a social network approach to analyze focal sample data on brown capuchins (Cebus apella), hamadryas baboons (Papio hamadryas), and diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) to understand how these species choose their play partners with respect to demographic variables. Using exponential random graph models (ERGMs), we found that sifaka and capuchins generally tended to play with animals who were similar to them. The baboons were only sensitive to age differences in the formation of strong play relationships. Our data most strongly support the training for the unexpected hypothesis, as according to predictions all species preferred to play with animals who were their close social partners, decreasing the possibility of cheating during play. Through the first application (to our knowledge) of ERGMs to primate behavior, we were able to compare the effects of many demographic variables on the complex, interdependent social structure of primates. Applying this tool to additional groups and species will provide further insight into evolutionary mechanisms of play behavior across taxa. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Beavers are ecosystem engineers known to modify the environment primarily via dam building. Beaver wetlands are complexes of newly created, mature, and abandoned beaver constructions within a stream network. Invertebrate dynamics across all habitats derived from these successional stages remains poorly explored.Here, we test how this natural successional gradient created by beaver affects invertebrate β‐diversity and its components (turnover and nestedness). Invertebrates were sampled in the Piedmont region of Georgia (U.S.A.) in two seasons (autumn and spring) in each of four stages of habitat succession: natural stream channels, forested wetlands created by newly formed beaver dams, mature open wetland marshes, and abandoned wetland meadows.In autumn, invertebrate communities were different among successional stages, apart from new versus abandoned wetlands and new versus mature wetlands, which were only marginally different, and streams versus abandoned wetlands. In spring, only the mature beaver wetland communities were unique, differing from both streams and from newly formed or abandoned wetlands. Beta‐diversity was nearly twice as high for the overall study‐system than any individual successional stage, which all had similar diversity. Additionally, turnover was significantly higher than nestedness in all stages.Community differences combined with high turnover among successional stages indicates that beaver wetland communities are not merely a subset of more stable mature wetlands or streams; instead, each stage has a different taxonomic make‐up. Our results strengthen the idea that beaver activity can be an important conservation tool by contributing substantially to diversity in areas where they are present. Beaver wetlands have the potential to help stabilise β‐ and regional diversity in the face of wetland loss from climate change and other human impacts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - ABSTRACT: Conservation and management activities are always constrained by finite resources. Therefore, decisions such as which sites to protect, whether existing habitat should be restored or whether new habitat should be created, and where on the landscape management efforts should be focused present difficult challenges. An overarching goal of many conservation or management plans is the long‐term persistence of populations, which is often dependent on functional connectivity and the maintenance of metapopulation dynamics. Graph theory and network approaches are frequently used tools for modeling functional connections between populations and between habitats. Less often, graph models are used to guide conservation or management decisions. We used spatial networks derived for an amphibian population to determine optimal locations to create new habitat, prioritize existing habitat for restoration, and determine the habitat most critical for maintaining connectivity within the existing metapopulation within Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, USA, 2012–2014. Using data collected at 206 breeding ponds over 3 years, we constructed demographic networks representing the functional connectivity between ponds by dispersing ringed salamanders (<italic>Ambystoma annulatum</italic>). We incorporated uncertainty in key model parameters through Monte Carlo simulation, and used a graph‐theoretical parameterization of the metapopulation mean lifetime model to assess how changes in network structure affect persistence of the network. We conducted addition and removal experiments within our Monte Carlo simulations to rank and prioritize locations for pond creation, ponds for restoration, and ponds for preservation. Salamanders bred in 106 ponds in ≥1 year; 2.4% of ponds functioned predominantly as sources and 51% of occupied ponds functioned predominantly as sinks. The importance of a pond to the network was correlated with the number of emigrants dispersing from a pond, the number of ponds reached by these dispersers, and the frequency a pond functioned as a source. Creating new ponds at optimal locations increased the persistence of the network an average of 15.4% compared to randomly selected locations, whereas selective restoration of currently unoccupied ponds resulted in an average increase of 31.4% in network persistence, as compared to randomly selected unoccupied ponds. Through Monte Carlo simulation, we constructed biologically informed demographic connectivity networks for use as a spatial conservation or management planning tool. Although our approach was implemented with an amphibian and a breeding pond network, it is generalizable to any species occupying discrete habitat patches. © 2017 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Unlike animals living in cohesive groups, those in groups with high fission–fusion dynamics can separate temporarily from other group members. While mechanisms underlying collective decisions are not well understood, it is possible that these separations occur by a divergence of interests between individuals. We evaluated the collective foraging decisions made by a group of Geoffroy's spider monkeys, Ateles geoffroyi , in a tropical forest in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. We assessed whether each individual's centrality in the social network, years living in the group, age, sex and social relationships affected the collective decisions. We examined two collective dynamics: foraging movements and arrivals to novel food patches, and in the latter, identified knowledgeable and naïve individuals. In both dynamics, spider monkeys exhibited partially shared leadership influenced by individual attributes, particularly the centrality in the social network, age and time in the group. These attributes have been associated with ecological knowledge. In arrivals to novel food patches, individuals most likely to have information about food resources (i.e. central individuals and males) had a greater likelihood to be followed, suggesting an influence of social information on the tendency to follow others. Also, we show evidence that social information could accelerate the arrival of naïve individuals to these patches. Collective foraging dynamics in our study group seem to arise from local rules that each individual follows when foraging: when a naïve individual needs social information to forage, it will follow the individual that is more likely to have this information, i.e. a central individual or a male; otherwise, when it is not possible or necessary to use social information, naïve individuals will follow a partner with which they have a strong social relationship. Thus, the interaction between local decision rules and the structure of the social network could drive collective coordination in fission–fusion dynamics. Highlights • Spider monkeys exhibit partially shared leadership to coordinate foraging movements. • Collective foraging dynamics emerge from individuals following localized rules. • The association network structure is an additional influence on foraging decisions.

AB  - Context The application of regional-level airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) data to characterize habitat patches and model habitat connectivity over large landscapes has not been well explored. Maintaining a connected network of habitat in the presence of anthropogenic disturbances is essential for regional-level conservation planning and the maintenance of biodiversity values. Objectives We quantified variation in connectivity following simulated changes in land cover and contrasted outcomes when different conservation priorities were emphasized. Methods First, we defined habitat patches using vegetation structural attributes identified via lidar. Second, habitat networks were constructed for different forest types and assessed using network connectivity metrics. And finally, land cover change scenarios were simulated using a series of habitat patch removals, representing the impact of implementing different spatial prioritization schemes. Results Networks for different forest structure types produced very different patch distributions. Conservation scenarios based on different schemes led to contrasting changes during land cover change simulations: the scheme prioritizing only habitat area resulted in immediate near-term losses in connectivity, whereas the scheme considering both habitat area and their spatial configurations maintained the overall connectivity most effectively. Adding climate constraints did not diminish or improve overall connectivity. Conclusions Both habitat area and habitat configuration should be considered in dynamic modeling of habitat connectivity under changing landscapes. This research provides a framework for integrating forest structure and cover attributes obtained from remote sensing data into network connectivity modeling, and may serve as a prototype for multi-criteria forest management and conservation planning.

AB  - Kinship plays a fundamental role in the evolution of social systems and is considered a key driver of group living. To understand the role of kinship in the formation and maintenance of social bonds, accurate measures of genetic relatedness are critical. Genotype‐by‐sequencing technologies are rapidly advancing the accuracy and precision of genetic relatedness estimates for wild populations. The ability to assign kinship from genetic data varies depending on a species' or population's mating system and pattern of dispersal, and empirical data from longitudinal studies are crucial to validate these methods. We use data from a long‐term behavioural study of a polygynandrous, bisexually philopatric marine mammal to measure accuracy and precision of parentage and genetic relatedness estimation against a known partial pedigree. We show that with moderate but obtainable sample sizes of approximately 4,235 SNPs and 272 individuals, highly accurate parentage assignments and genetic relatedness coefficients can be obtained. Additionally, we subsample our data to quantify how data availability affects relatedness estimation and kinship assignment. Lastly, we conduct a social network analysis to investigate the extent to which accuracy and precision of relatedness estimation improve statistical power to detect an effect of relatedness on social structure. Our results provide practical guidance for minimum sample sizes and sequencing depth for future studies, as well as thresholds for post hoc interpretation of previous analyses.

AB  - Social information, acquired through the observation of others, has been documented in a variety of adaptive contexts. The transmission of social information relies on social connections and therefore it is important to consider that individuals may vary in their access to, and use of, such information. Social network analysis allows for the consideration of individual variation in social connections, which until recently has been ignored in the study of social processes. Furthermore, few previous studies of social information use have considered the potential effects of traits such as dominance and personality, which have been found to influence group social structure. We used network-based diffusion analysis, which incorporates information on individual social associations, to examine whether wild flocks of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus , utilize social information when locating novel foraging patches. Additionally, we incorporated individual traits (age, sex, dominance and exploratory personality) while examining flocks from rural and urban environments, to assess the influence of individual and habitat level characteristics on the rate of information transmission. Social information transmission was found to occur in all flocks, as individual time of discovery of the novel foraging patches was explained by network connections as predicted. However, the only individual level variable found to influence social transmission was dominance rank: dominant individuals had higher rates of information transmission than subordinates. We also found that the rate of social information transmission was higher in rural than urban environments. Our results highlight the importance of considering social associations when examining social information use. Additionally, our results suggest that dominant individuals have greater access to social information than more subordinate individuals, which may demonstrate a previously undocumented additional benefit provided by social dominance.

AB  - The colonization of an animal's tissues by its microbial partners creates networks of communication across the host's body. We used the natural binary light-organ symbiosis between the squid Euprymna scolopes and its luminous bacterial partner, Vibrio fischeri, to define the impact of colonization on transcriptomic networks in the host. A night-active predator, E. scolopes coordinates the bioluminescence of its symbiont with visual cues from the environment to camouflage against moon and starlight. Like mammals, this symbiosis has a complex developmental program and a strong day/night rhythm. We determined how symbiont colonization impacted gene expression in the light organ itself, as well as in two anatomically remote organs: the eye and gill. While the overall transcriptional signature of light organ and gill were more alike, the impact of symbiosis was most pronounced and similar in light organ and eye, both in juvenile and adult animals. Furthermore, the presence of a symbiosis drove daily rhythms of transcription within all three organs. Finally, a single mutation in V. fischeri--specifically, deletion of the lux operon, which abrogates symbiont luminescence--reduced the symbiosis-dependent transcriptome of the light organ by two-thirds. In addition, while the gills responded similarly to light-organ colonization by either the wildtype or mutant, luminescence was required for all of the colonizationassociated transcriptional responses in the juvenile eye. This study defines not only the impact of symbiont colonization on the coordination of animal transcriptomes, but also provides insight into how such changes might impact the behavior and ecology of the host.

AB  - Although human activities are known to affect the social behaviour of group-living animals, the resilience of animals'' social structure to disturbance is poorly understood. In the 1990s, bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops aduncus, in Moreton Bay, Australia, formed two distinct social communities (‘trawler’ and ‘nontrawler dolphins’) based on foraging interactions (or lack thereof) with commercial prawn trawlers. Members of the two communities almost never associated, despite overlapping home ranges. Since then, changes to fisheries legislation have substantially reduced trawling in Moreton Bay. We used association analyses and social network metrics to compare patterns of sociality among bottlenose dolphins across two periods: 1997–1999 (during trawling) and 2008–2010 (post trawling). Over this decade, their social network became less differentiated and more compact (average geodesic distance between individuals decreased), with significantly more and stronger associations between individuals (mean and maximum half-weight indices increased). The previously described partitioning into two communities has disappeared, with former ‘trawler’ and ‘nontrawler dolphins’ now dispersed over the entire social network and associating with each other. This restructuring suggests that although fisheries can influence the social behaviour of bottlenose dolphins, their social structure represents a complex adaptive system that is resilient to disturbance.

AB  - Today, major landscape changes affect ecological connectivity exerting adverse effects on ecosystems. Connectivity is a critical element of landscape structure and supports ecosystem functionality. Landscape connectivity can be efficiently increased in landscape ecology by building ecological networks (EN) through models mimicking the interaction between animal and vegetal species and their environment. ENs are important in sustainable landscape planning, where they need to be studied both by applying landscape metrics and by performing multi-temporal analyses. This paper presents theoretical and practical evidence of an analysis of a multispecies ecological network in Calabria (Italy) and its changes over three decades. Landscape connectivity was modeled basing on 66 focal faunal species' requirements. Human disturbance (HD) was defined and assessed according to distance from different disturbance sources. This allowed for the definition of overall habitat quality (oHQ). Landscape permeability to the animal movement was focused as the main concept to measure landscape fragmentation. Landscape graph theory was applied to perform a spatial comparison of the ENs robustness. Many binary and probabilistic indices and landscape morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) were used in this perspective. We obtained a set of ecological networks, including nodes, patches (i.e., habitat patches), linkages, and corridors, all intertwined in one giant component. The multi-temporal analysis showed many indices' stationary values, while MSPA yielded an increase of habitat quality and habitat patches in core areas. This methodological approach allowed for assessing the regional EN's robustness in the time-span considered, thus providing a reliable tool for landscape planners and communities. • A design of multispecies ecological networks (EN) at a regional scale is proposed. • The multi-temporal assessment is based on a set of spatial network indicators. • Landscape connectivity was modeled based on the different species requirements. • EN configuration evolved over time mantaining its potential for biodiversity conservation. • EN components should be considered as structural invariants of planning tools.

AB  - Several fish species are characterized by social systems in which individuals prefer to interact with specific group mates. However, there is no clear evidence that such associations are equitable, that is, they are mutual between individuals. We addressed this issue in the guppy (Poecilia reticulata), a species in which social network analyses have evidenced nonrandom social associations between individuals. We measured the mutual preference in pairs of guppies that previously familiarized in groups of either 2 or 6 individuals. To estimate the equitability of social associations, we first tested the preference of one fish for a familiar stimulus fish over an unfamiliar stimulus fish, and then, we similarly tested the preference of the other fish. Irrespective of the group size experienced during familiarization (2 or 6 individuals), we found a within-pair consistency in the preference for the familiar fish, indicating that guppies developed social associations that are mutual between individuals. In a further condition, we tested pairs of unfamiliar individuals to assess the role of familiarity in equitable social associations. We found that equitable social associations did not develop in absence of previous familiarization and were not based on spontaneous preferences or phenotypic assortment. Our results demonstrate that familiarity mediates the development of equitable social associations in guppies and suggest that this behavior may be more widespread than previously considered.

AB  - Increasingly, large-scale conservation initiatives (e.g. through protected area networks and transboundary connectivity initiatives) are growing in prevalence as their diverse sustainability benefits are further understood. Conventional, centralized approaches to conservation, often featuring unconnected discrete 'patches', are no longer sufficient for achieving effective, long-term protection. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of how to achieve effective large-scale conservation initiatives by addressing the following objectives: (1) To assess the degree to which local actors are involved in coastal and marine conservation practices, with a focus on large-scale conservation initiatives (LCIs); and, (2) To identify barriers and opportunities for achieving effective large-scale conservation. This paper presents findings from research in the Dominican Republic where social-ecological components of coastal and marine systems are considered from multiple perspectives to advance management and increase effectiveness of LCIs. Data were acquired through semi-structured interviews with 35 coastal and marine actors (e.g. fishers, ministers, non-governmental organizations, practitioners, academics) working at local to international scales. Interview data were analysed through thematic coding using QSR-Nvivo 12 software. Respondents expressed that non-governmental actors (e.g. private organizations, coastal communities) should have an increased role in developing, implementing and managing coastal and marine LCIs. Additionally, respondents commented on strategies to enhance social connectivity (i.e. sharing experiences, programs and expertise) within coastal and marine practices to enhance effectiveness and facilitate learning. Findings contribute to the understanding of complex coastal and marine social-ecological systems of the Dominican Republic and provide further support for involving multiple actors in governance processes.

AB  - The concept of directed social learning predicts that social learning opportunities for an individual will depend on social dynamics, context and demonstrator identity. However, few empirical studies have examined social attention biases in animal groups. Sex-based and kinship-based biases in social learning and social attention towards females have been shown in a despotic and female philopatric primate: the vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus). The present study examined social attention during the juvenile period. Social attention was recorded through 5-min focal observations during periods of natural foraging. Kin emerged as the most important focus of social attention in juveniles, intensified by biased spatial proximity towards matrilineal related members. The highest-ranking conspecifics were more frequently observed by juveniles than low-ranking ones. Additionally, younger and orphaned juveniles showed higher levels of social attention overall, compared to other age categories. No effect of the juvenile's hierarchical rank was detected, suggesting that the variation in social attention recorded reflects different biases and stages of social learning and socialisation, rather than social anxiety. Juvenile females tended to exhibit a dominance-based bias more strongly than did males. This might be explained by a greater emphasis on attaining social knowledge during juvenile socialisation in the philopatric sex. Moreover, despite a preferred association between juveniles, social attention was more often directed to adults, suggesting that adults may still be more often chosen as a target of attention independent of their dominance rank.

AB  - Animals often interact non-randomly with conspecifics, and association preferences can differ across life-history stages to maximize individuals' fitness. Mongolian gerbils ( Meriones unguiculatus) are a social rodent that live in highly seasonal habitats and display seasonal fluctuations in population density, growth rate and the size of overlapped home ranges. Nevertheless, whether gerbils modify their social relationships at different life-history stages remains unknown. Here, we used social network analysis to examine whether social associations differ between the sexes and between life-history stages in a wild population of Mongolian gerbils. We quantified social attributes at both group level (assortativity) and individual level (social differentiation and degree, closeness and betweenness centrality); these attributes reflect individuals' social preferences and their potential influence on others in the network. We found that both male and female gerbils established fewer inter-group social connections during the food-hoarding season than during the breeding season, revealing constraints on sociality. Similarly, during the food-hoarding season, degree centrality and social differentiation increased significantly whereas closeness and betweenness centrality decreased significantly. Together, these results suggest that gerbils have relatively more partners and preferred associations and decreased influence over others in the network during the food-hoarding season. In addition, we found no significant difference in any of the social attribute between males and females, but there was a significant interaction effect between sex and season on degree, closeness and betweenness centrality. Our results demonstrate that Mongolian gerbils adjust their association strategies to adapt to the changes of life history. Such adjustments may balance the costs/benefits associated with survival and reproduction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Highlights • Capture-recapture models are developed to analyse animal social networks. • The method accounts for imperfect and heterogeneous detection. • A simulation study is carried out to validate the approach. • The visualisation of networks and calculation of standard metrics are illustrated. Abstract Social network analysis provides a powerful tool for understanding social organisation of animals. However, in free-ranging populations, it is almost impossible to monitor exhaustively the individuals of a population and to track their associations. Ignoring the issue of imperfect and possibly heterogeneous individual detection can lead to substantial bias in standard network measures. Here, we develop capture-recapture models to analyse network data while accounting for imperfect and heterogeneous detection. We carry out a simulation study to validate our approach. In addition, we show how the visualisation of networks and the calculation of standard metrics can account for detection probabilities. The method is illustrated with data from a population of Commerson's dolphin (Cephalorhynchus commersonii) in Patagonia Argentina. Our approach provides a step towards a general statistical framework for the analysis of social networks of wild animal populations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Traits that undergo massive natural selection pressure, with multiple events of positive selection, are hard to find. Social behaviour, in social animals, is crucial for survival, and genetic networks involved in behaviour, such as those of serotonin (5‐HT) and other neurotransmitters, must be the target of natural selection. Here, we used molecular analyses to search for signals of positive selection in the 5‐HT system and found such signals in the M3‐M4 intracellular domain of the 5‐HT3A serotonin receptor subunit (HTR3A) in primates. We detected four amino acid sites with signs of putatively positive selection (398, 403, 432 and 416); the first three showed indications of being selected in New World monkeys (NWM, Platyrrhini), specifically in the Callitrichinae branch. Additionally, we searched for associations of these amino acid variants with social behavioural traits (i.e. sex‐biased dispersal, dominance and social monogamy) using classical and Bayesian methods, and found statistically significant associations for unbiased sex dispersal (398L and 416S), unbiased sex dominance (416S) and social monogamy (416S), as well as significant positive correlation between female dispersal and 403G. Furthermore, we found putatively functional protein motifs determined by three selected sites, of which we highlight a ligand motif to GSK3 in the 416S variant, appearing only in Platyrrhini. 5‐HT, 5‐HT3A receptor and GSK3 are part of a network that participates in neurodevelopment and regulates behaviour, among other functions. We suggest that these genetic variations, together with those found in other neurotransmitter systems, must contribute to adaptive behaviours and consequently to fitness in NWMs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - From a cognitive point of view, management and knowledge of social relationships is thought to be very challenging. Because of ecological and demographic constraints, relationships are likely to be prone to variation and hence need constant updating. Social network analysis is a potential tool to quantify the information that needs to be processed. However, despite the growing number of studies on social networks, few have focused on their dynamics and how they evolve across time. Here we present one of the rare studies that tests the influence of demographic variation on social relationships' stability through temporal analysis. Using field data collected on three wild groups of vervet monkeys, Chlorocebus aethiops , we first analysed the relationships' stability by running correlations between 3-month periods. Then, we investigated how natural demographic variation changed individual centralities (eigenvector) and strength of dyadic relationships within both grooming and proximity networks over a period of 2 years. In vervets, females are philopatric, while males emigrate from their natal group. Thus, we tested whether changes in demography had more influence on network centrality measures and relationship strength in females and their juveniles than in males. Correlations between periods yielded no evidence that predictability of future relationship quality declined with time from current relationship quality. In addition, male immigration was mostly responsible for increases in the core group members' centrality while male emigration had the opposite effect. Regarding dyadic relationships, we found inconsistent patterns that varied with respect to how age/sex and immigration/disappearance affected the network studied (grooming versus proximity). Our findings support the idea that social networks are dynamic structures that vary through time. Similar analyses on other species are needed to investigate which network features emerge as candidates responsible for variation in the complexity with which individuals keep track of relationships.

AB  - Distributed social learning may occur at many temporal and spatial scales, but it rarely adds up to a stable culture. Cultures vary in stability and diversity (polymorphism), ranging from chaotic or drifting cultures, through cumulative polymorphic cultures, to stable monolithic cultures with high conformity levels. What features can sustain polymorphism, preventing cultures from collapsing into either chaotic or highly conforming states? We investigate this question by integrating studies across two quite separate disciplines: the emergence of song cultures in birds, and the spread of public opinion and social conventions in humans. In songbirds, the learning process has been studied in great detail, while in human studies the structure of social networks has been experimentally manipulated on large scales. In both cases, the manner in which communication signals are compressed and filtered - either during learning or while traveling through the social network - can affect culture polymorphism and stability. We suggest a simple mechanism of a shifting balance between converging and diverging social forces to explain these effects. Understanding social forces that shape cultural evolution might be useful for designing agile communication systems, which are stable and polymorphic enough to promote gradual changes in institutional behavior.

AB  - Most social mammal species exhibit male-biased dispersal. Sex bias in dispersal leads to a higher degree of relatedness among individuals of the philopatric sex, thus an atypical dispersal pattern might lead to deviations in the typical within-group kinship structure. Kinship, in turn, influences patterns of social interactions, as widely evident by kin-biased behaviors. We investigated the link between dispersal, relatedness structure, and sociopositive interactions established by adult females of black capuchin monkeys ( Sapajus nigritus) living in a population that experiences female dispersal, an unusual pattern for capuchin monkeys. The study was conducted in Parque Estadual Carlos Botelho (PECB), within the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. We addressed dispersal and relatedness patterns by genotyping 20 adults of 3 groups across 9 microsatellite loci. We also sampled the monkeys' behavior and compared spatial association frequencies and rates of grooming among same- and opposite-sex dyads. There was no difference between males and females in genetic parameters; both males and females show low coefficients of relatedness indicating that neither sex is consistently philopatric. The mean pairwise coefficient of relatedness for co-resident females was not higher than that for co-resident males. Compared to other populations of capuchin monkeys, female bond was weak, as evident by lower spatial association frequencies, reduced rates of grooming and lack of correlation between coefficients of relatedness and measures of dyadic sociopositive interactions. Our findings thus confirm that female dispersal is a habitual process in the capuchin population of PECB, and that, as expected, dispersal by females strongly influences the relatedness structure of the population as well as the affiliative relationships among female groupmates.

AB  - Abstract In this study, we propose a novel framework combining spatially explicit population viability analysis and optimization for prioritizing fish passage barrier mitigation decisions. Our model aims to maximize the equilibrium population size, or alternatively minimize the extinction risk, of a target fish species subject to a budget on the total cost of barrier mitigation. A case study involving a wild coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) population from the Tillamook basin, Oregon, USA is used to illustrate the benefits of our approach. We consider two different spawning adult dispersal patterns, river and reach level homing, as well as straying. Under density dependent population growth, we find that homing behavior type has a significant effect on barrier mitigation decisions. In particular, with reach homing, our model produces virtually the same population sizes as a more traditional barrier prioritization procedure designed to maximize accessible habitat. With river homing, however, we find that it is not necessary to remove all barriers in order to maximize equilibrium population size. Indeed, a stochastic version of our model reveals that removing all barriers actually results in a marginal increase in quasi-extinction risk. We hypothesize that this is due to a population thinning effect of barriers, resulting in a surplus of recruits in areas of low spawner density. Our findings highlights the importance of considering spatiotemporal fish population dynamics in river connectivity restoration planning. By adding greater biological realism, models such as ours can help conservation managers to more strategically allocate limited resources, resulting in both cost savings and improved population status for a focal species. Highlights • A model is developed for optimizing river barrier mitigation actions. • Density dependent growth and dispersal dynamics are incorporated. • The model is applied to a wild coho population from the Oregon Coast. • Degree of homing fidelity has a strong impact on optimal decision making. • Leaving some barriers in place may help to decrease quasi-extinction risk.

AB  - Abstract: Understanding the spatial structure of individual variation is critical to assessing the mechanisms and scale of species‐level ecological and evolutionary responses. But the continuity and complexity of streams can make it difficult to discern spatial structure, and data on individual variation spanning spatial scales are rare. Our goal was to objectively resolve the scale of ecological and evolutionary processes affecting the salamander Gyrinophilus porphyriticus by testing for spatial structure in individual variation across a headwater stream network. We used 3 years of spatially explicit capture–mark–recapture data from four headwater streams in the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, USA, to test for individual variation in survival at three scales: (a) among c. 2‐km<sup>2</sup> watersheds, (b) in 500‐m downstream and upstream reaches within watersheds and (c) in riffle and pool habitats along reaches. We also tested for corresponding spatial variation in individual body condition and morphology to gain insight on the causes and implications of variation in survival. Survival of G. porphyriticus larvae was constant among watersheds, but differed by reach and habitat. Larval survival was higher in upstream reaches than downstream reaches, matching the distribution of predatory brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), which were restricted to downstream reaches. Larval survival was also higher in pools than riffles. Survival of G. porphyriticus adults was constant at all scales. Larval body condition was higher in downstream reaches than upstream reaches. Both larvae and adults differed in morphology at the habitat scale: individuals in pools had longer limbs than individuals in riffles. Negative covariation in larval survival and body condition at the reach scale suggests that there is a trade‐off between fitness and proximate performance along streams. The surprising differences between habitats in survival and morphology show the potential for fine‐scale ecology–evolution interactions in streams, potentially driven by differences in flow and gradient conditions in riffles and pools. Our results suggest that the larval stage is key to understanding individual, population and community‐level processes affecting G. porphyriticus. More broadly, this research provides a novel empirical link between traditional studies of fine‐scale ecological complexity in streams and recent studies showing consistent spatial dynamics at the network scale. By documenting differences in survival, body condition and morphology at reach and habitat scales, we hope this work shows the feasibility and value of spatially explicit approaches to species‐level ecological and evolutionary questions in streams.

AB  - Social networks provide an established tool to implement heterogeneous contact structures in epidemiological models. Dynamic temporal changes in contact structure and ranging behaviour of wildlife may impact disease dynamics. A consensus has yet to emerge, however, concerning the conditions in which network dynamics impact model outcomes, as compared to static approximations that average contact rates over longer time periods. Furthermore, as many pathogens can be transmitted both environmentally and via close contact, it is important to investigate the relative influence of both transmission routes in real-world populations., Here, we use empirically derived networks from a population of wild primates, Verreaux's sifakas ( Propithecus verreauxi), and simulated networks to investigate pathogen spread in dynamic vs. static social networks., First, we constructed a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model of Cryptosporidium spread in wild Verreaux's sifakas. We incorporated social and environmental transmission routes and parameterized the model for two different climatic seasons. Second, we used simulated networks and greater variation in epidemiological parameters to investigate the conditions in which dynamic networks produce larger outbreak sizes than static networks., We found that average outbreak size of Cryptosporidium infections in sifakas was larger when the disease was introduced in the dry season than in the wet season, driven by an increase in home range overlap towards the end of the dry season. Regardless of season, dynamic networks always produced larger average outbreak sizes than static networks. Larger outbreaks in dynamic models based on simulated networks occurred especially when the probability of transmission and recovery were low. Variation in tie strength in the dynamic networks also had a major impact on outbreak size, while network modularity had a weaker influence than epidemiological parameters that determine transmission and recovery., Our study adds to emerging evidence that dynamic networks can change predictions of disease dynamics, especially if the disease shows low transmissibility and a long infectious period, and when environmental conditions lead to enhanced between-group contact after an infectious agent has been introduced.

AB  - Larval transport by marine organisms is regulated by a combination of vertical swimming behavior and seasonal reproductive timing, but recent studies suggest horizontal swimming behaviors may also be important. Larvae in highly productive coastal upwelling regions are especially vulnerable to offshore transport and must employ effective dispersal “strategies” to return onshore to suitable settlement sites. Using a primitive-equation numerical model, we investigate how horizontal swimming affects nearshore larval supply and potential settlement and connectivity during climatological spring and summer in central California, a region of persistent coastal upwelling within the California Current System. The addition of shoreward swimming with speeds of 1–7 cm s −1 increases nearshore larval supply by a factor of 1.4–13, depending on the speed, timing of its onset, and the vertical swimming behavior of the larvae, which included both diel and ontogenetic vertical migrations. Nearshore larval supply increases approximately linearly with swimming speed integrated over the pelagic larval duration. While pelagic connectivity increases with shoreward swimming for all vertical behaviors investigated, spatial patterns of connectivity, when standardized by nearshore larval supply, are similar with and without horizontal behavior. Onshore swimming broadens the alongshore extent of areas that can act as effective source regions in central California, increasing potential dispersal distances 11–26%. A related statistic, the reverse pelagic connectivity, reveals Monterey Bay and the Gulf of the Farallones as important source regions that should be considered when adaptively managing California's network of marine protected areas.

AB  - Current understanding of mutualistic networks is grounded largely in data on interaction frequency, yet mutualistic network dynamics are also shaped by interaction quality—the functional outcomes of individual interactions on reproduction and survival. The difficulty of obtaining data on functional outcomes has resulted in limited understanding of functional variation among a network's pairwise species interactions, of the study designs that are necessary to capture major sources of functional variation, and of predictors of functional variation that may allow generalization across networks.In this community‐scale study, we targeted a key functional outcome in plant–frugivore networks: the impact of frugivore gut passage on seed germination. We used captive frugivore feeding trials and germination experiments in an island ecosystem, attaining species‐level coverage across all extant native frugivores and the plants they consume to (a) assess sources of functional variation, (b) separate effects of pulp removal from those of scarification via gut passage, and (c) test trait‐based correlates of gut passage effect sizes.We found antagonistic seed predation effects of a frugivore previously assumed to be a seed disperser, highlighting the need to consider functional outcomes rather than interaction frequency alone. The other frugivores each exhibited similar impacts for individual plant species, with benefits primarily caused by pulp removal rather than scarification, supporting the use of animal functional groups in this context. In contrast, plant species varied widely in impacts of gut passage on germination. Species with smaller seeds and more frugivore partners had larger benefits of gut passage, showing promise for network metrics and functional traits to predict functional variation among plants.Synthesis. Combining network and demographic approaches, we assessed the degree and sources of variation in a key functional outcome of plant–frugivore interactions across an entire network. Using a detailed study design, our work shows how simpler study designs can capture primary sources of functional variation and that functional traits and network metrics may allow generalization across networks. Efficiently measuring and generalizing sources of functional variation within mutualistic networks will strengthen our ability to model network dynamics and predict mutualist responses to global change. A challenge for mutualistic network research is to incorporate information on the functional outcomes of interactions rather than focus on interaction frequency alone. For an entire network, we measured a key functional outcome of plant–frugivore interactions: the impact of gut passage on germination. Demonstrating potential for generalization, we show support for using animal functional groupings, for simpler study designs to capture key functional variation, and for functional traits and network metrics as predictor of functional variation.

AB  - Large herbivores display restricted area searching and, therefore, in food-rich patches, animals should spend more time feeding, move slowly, and take tortuous movement paths. Intersexual differences in social behavior might disrupt restricted area searching that, in turn, might affect ecological differences between size-dimorphic females and males. We measured time the head was up (head up), step lengths (m/min), and tortuosity of foraging paths in 547 focal observations in a nonmigratory population of Roosevelt elk (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) in Redwood National and State Parks, California, United States. Focal observations were 4–15 min in length. Head up was positively related to proximity (within 1 body length of other elk) for females and males but the slope was steeper for males. When males were aggregated with females, head up was more elevated than when males were aggregated with other males. Sex-specific social behaviors did not influence step length and foraging path tortuosity. Social behavior disrupted efficient foraging. Connecting social behavior to foraging behavior can help explain the numerous ways that size-dimorphic females and males display ecological differences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Inter-individual contacts in wildlife populations are usually highly heterogeneous. This variation translates into differential disease transmission rates between individuals, which have vital consequences for the spread, persistence, and control of infectious diseases. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) is an abundant game species across Europe that poses serious health threats to wildlife, livestock, and humans. However, factors shaping contact rates and structure in wild boar populations, key parameters in disease ecology, remain poorly studied. We quantified dyadic association rates, as a proxy of contacts, and individualbased network centralitymeasures using telemetry data from 3 wild boar populations across Europe. Next, we examined the effect of sex, age, group membership, and space use on association rates and individual centrality. Contact rates depended strongly on the distance between individual home ranges; the most frequent associations occurred at distances of 0-1 km (mostly within groups), less frequent at 1-3 km (mostly between groups), and sporadic at >4 km. Association rates were an order of magnitude higher within social groups than between them. Between-group association rates were only dependent on the distance between groups, with no apparent effect of animal sex or age. At the social network level, young animals (0.5-2 yr) showed greater between-group connectivity and a more central position in the network than adults. Our results highlight substantial contact heterogeneities in wild boar populations, which should be considered in epidemiological modeling and disease control actions. First, wild boar contact rates are strongly constrained socially and spatially. Hence, management measures reducing these constraints, such as supplementary feeding and intensive hunting, may lead to increased disease transmission rates. Second, young wild boars show exceptional connectivity within the population, highlighting their high capacity for disease transmission. Therefore, targeted removal of yearlings should be considered to optimize disease control efforts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There are increasing calls for “conservation stocking” to counter declines in Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) populations, the assumption being that stocking can bypass population bottlenecks and increase recruitment over natural processes. However, there are too few quantitative studies with sufficient data to assess the efficacy of conservation stocking. The Girnock Burn is a unique long-term monitoring site where adult and juvenile salmon numbers have been monitored for over 50 years, including 11 years with conservation stocking. Adults were monitored at a fixed trap and juveniles were monitored by electrofishing. In stocked years, ova were incubated in surface water to reduce density-independent over-winter mortality. In eight years, eyed ova were stocked at uniform densities to reduce local density-dependence. In three years, stocking replicated natural spatial variability in ova deposition removing any potential benefits of reduced local density-dependence. Juvenile production was estimated by summing the product of reach-scale density estimates and river area obtained from a novel spatial statistical river network model that incorporated the effects of capture probability, habitat and stock level. Capture probability varied with life-stage (age 0+ fry or ≥1+ parr), electrofishing pass and day of the year, but importantly also exhibited a positive temporal trend across years. Survival from ova to fry was density-independent and higher under uniform stocking than natural spawning or simulated natural spawning. Under uniform stocking, fry densities varied smoothly with altitude, while under natural spawning and simulated natural spawning, fry exhibited a more patchy distribution. Increased fry production did not translate to increased parr production, which was strongly density-dependent. This likely reflected the inability of fry to move between stocked locations and suitable overwintering habitat, decreasing survival between fry and parr life-stages. Consequently, there was no overall benefit of stocking. The modelling framework used in this study provides a valuable approach for interpreting long-term datasets where site locations, equipment and staffing vary over time. The long-term Girnock dataset was valuable in separating management action from natural population regulation and permitting understanding of ecological processes. The study indicates that conservation stocking can be ineffective, even where implemented to best scientific standards. It is therefore recommended that a detailed understanding of local population dynamics is obtained, and a realistic appraisal of the expected benefits of stocking is undertaken, before management actions are considered.

AB  - Ecologists regularly use animal contact networks to describe interactions underlying pathogen transmission, gene flow, and information transfer. However, empirical descriptions of contact often overlook some features of individual movement, and decisions about what kind of network to use in a particular setting are commonly ad hoc. Here, we relate individual movement trajectories to contact networks through a tripartite network model of individual, space, and time nodes. Most networks used in animal contact studies (e.g. individual association networks, home range overlap networks, and spatial networks) are simplifications of this tripartite model. The tripartite structure can incorporate a broad suite of alternative ecological metrics like home range sizes and patch occupancy patterns into inferences about contact network metrics such as modularity and degree distribution.

AB  - The shape of most animal cells is controlled by the actin cortex, a thin network of dynamic actin filaments (F-actin) situated just beneath the plasma membrane. The cortex is held far from equilibrium by both active stresses and polymer turnover: Molecular motors drive deformations required for cell morphogenesis, while actin-filament disassembly dynamics relax stress and facilitate cortical remodeling. While many aspects of actin-cortex mechanics are well characterized, a mechanistic understanding of how nonequilibrium actin turnover contributes to stress relaxation is still lacking. To address this, we developed a reconstituted in vitro system of entangled F-actin, wherein the steady-state length and turnover rate of F-actin are controlled by the actin regulatory proteins cofilin, profilin, and formin, which sever, recycle, and assemble filaments, respectively. Cofilin-mediated severing accelerates the turnover and spatial reorganization of F-actin, without significant changes to filament length. We demonstrate that cofilimmediated severing is a single-timescale mode of stress relaxation that tunes the low-frequency viscosity over two orders of magnitude. These findings serve as the foundation for understanding the mechanics ofmore physiological F-actin networks with turnover and inform an updated microscopic model of single-filament turnover. They also demonstrate that polymer activity, in the form of ATP hydrolysis on F-actin coupled to nucleotide-dependent cofilin binding, is sufficient to generate a form of active matter wherein asymmetric filament disassembly preserves filament number despite sustained severing.

AB  - Recent scholarship suggests that the genomes of those around us affect our own phenotypes. Much of the empirical evidence for such "metagenomic" effects comes from animal studies, where the socio-genetic environment can be easily manipulated. Among humans, it is more difficult to identify such effects given the nonrandom distribution of genes and environments. Here we leverage the as-if-random distribution of grade-mates' genomes conditional on school-level variation in a nationally representative sample. Specifically, we evaluate whether one's peers' genetic propensity to smoke affects one's own smoking behavior net of one's own genotype. Results show that peer genetic propensity to smoke has a substantial effect on an individual's smoking outcome. This is true not only when the peer group includes direct friends, and therefore where the individual plays an active role in shaping the metagenomic context but also when the peer group includes all grade-mates and thus in cases where the individual does not select the metagenomic environment. We explore these effects further and show that a small minority with high genetic risk to smoke ('bad apples') can greatly affect the smoking behavior of an entire grade. The methodology used in this paper offers a potential solution to many of the challenges inherent in estimating peer effects in nonexperimental settings and can be utilized to study a wide range of outcomes with a genetic basis. On a policy level, our results suggest that efforts to reduce adolescent smoking should take into account metagenomic effects, especially bad apples, within social networks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Although many pharmaceutical compounds (and their metabolites) can induce harmful impacts at the molecular, physiological and behavioural levels, their underlying mechanistic associations have remained largely unexplored. Here, we utilized RNA-Seq to build a whole brain transcriptome profile to examine the impact of a common endocrine disrupting pharmaceutical (17α-ethinyl estradiol, EE2) on reproductive behaviour in wild guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Specifically, we annotated 16,791 coding transcripts in whole brain tissue in relation to the courtship behaviour (i.e. sigmoid display) of EE2 exposed (at environmentally relevant concentration of 8 ng/L for 28-days) and unexposed guppies. Further, we obtained 10,960 assembled transcripts matching in the non-coding orthologous genomes. Behavioural responses were assessed using a standard mate choice experiment, which allowed us to disentangle chemical cues from visual cues. We found that a high proportion of the RNAseq reads aligned back to our de novo assembled transcriptome with 80.59% mapping rate. Behavioural experiments showed that when males were presented only with female visual cues, there was a significant interaction between male treatment and female treatment in the time spent in the preference zone. This is one of the first studies to show that transcriptome-wide changes are associated with the reproductive behaviour of fish: EE2 exposed male guppies that performed high levels of courtship had a gene profile that deviated the most from the other treatment groups, while both non-courting EE2 and control males had similar gene signatures. Using Gene Ontology pathway analysis, our study shows that EE2-exposed males had gene transcripts enriched for pathways associated with altered immunity, starvation, altered metabolism and spermatogenesis. Our study demonstrates that multiple gene networks orchestrate courting behaviour, emphasizing the importance of investigating impacts of pharmaceuticals on gene networks instead of single genes. Image 1 • We utilized RNA-Seq to assess the impact of EE2 on gene expression and behaviour of guppies. • EE2-exposure did not alter male courtship behaviour but, instead, altered their mate choice. • Our study shows that transcriptome-wide changes are associated with the reproductive behaviour of fish. • Courting EE2 males had a gene profile that deviated the most from the other treatment groups. • Highlights the importance of investigating gene networks instead of single genes.

AB  - Interspecies interaction is an essential mechanism for bacterial communities to develop antibiotic resistance via horizontal gene transfer. Nonetheless, how bacterial interactions vary along the environmental transmission of antibiotics and the underpinnings remain unclear. To address it, we explore potential microbial associations by analyzing bacterial networks generated from 16S rRNA gene sequences and functional networks containing a large number of antibiotic-resistance genes (ARGs). Antibiotic concentration decreased by more than 4000-fold along the environmental transmission chain from manure samples of swine farms to aerobic compost, compost-amended agricultural soils, and neighboring agricultural soils. Both bacterial and functional networks became larger in nodes and links with decreasing antibiotic concentrations, likely resulting from lower antibiotics stress. Nonetheless, bacterial networks became less clustered with decreasing antibiotic concentrations, while functional networks became more clustered. Modularity, a key topological property that enhances system resilience to antibiotic stress, remained high for functional networks, but the modularity values of bacterial networks were the lowest when antibiotic concentrations were intermediate. To explain it, we identified a clear shift from deterministic processes, particularly variable selection, to stochastic processes at intermediate antibiotic concentrations as the dominant mechanism in shaping bacterial communities. Collectively, our results revealed microbial network dynamics and suggest that the modularity value of association networks could serve as an important indicator of antibiotic concentrations in the environment. Unlabelled Image • Bacterial taxonomic compositions changed from the dominance of Firmicutes to Proteobacteria alongside antibiotic transmission. • Ofloxacin and tetracycline were most predictive antibiotics for bacterial and functional network properties, respectively. • Modularity was consistently much higher in functional networks than bacterial networks. • Modularity of association networks can be an indicator of system stability for microbial communities. • Microbial community assembly is one of the primary mechanisms underlying microbial interactions.

AB  - The study of social breeding systems is often gene focused, and the field of insect sociobiology has been successful at assimilating tools and techniques from molecular biology. One common output from sociogenomic studies is a gene list. Gene lists are readily generated from microarray, RNA sequencing, or other molecular screens that typically aim to prioritize genes based on the differences in their expression. Gene lists, however, are often unsatisfying because the information they provide is simply tabular and does not explain how genes interact with each other, or how genetic interactions change in real time under social or environmental circumstances. Here, we promote a view that is relatively common to molecular systems biology, where gene lists are converted into gene networks that better describe the functional connections that regulate behavioral traits. We present a narrative related to honeybee worker sterility to show how network analysis can be used to reprioritize candidate genes based on connectivity rather than their freestanding expression values. Networks can also reveal multigene modules, motifs, clusters or other system‐wide properties that might not be apparent from an ab initio list. We argue that because network analyses are not restricted to "genes" as nodes, their implementation can potentially connect multiple levels of biological organization into a single, progressively complex study system. Relationship between social and organizational complexity. At any level of organizational complexity, division of labor among "individuals" (e.g., genes, proteins, neurons, organisms, and species) may be (a) absent, (b) weak, or (c) strong, depending on how the network is structured. In highly "social" networks there are few "individuals" that are centrally situated with many dependents—for example, a queen in a social (insect) network, a hub gene in a transcriptional regulatory network, a ganglion in a neural network or a keystone species in an ecological network. For the most "socially" complex networks, the division of labor among "individuals" may be so strong that single genes, proteins, neurons, organisms, or species mediate a disproportionate number of interactions and their removal would jeopardize the entire structure of each network.

AB  - Differences in individual behaviour affect social interactions and contribute to the spatial structuring of animal populations. However, disturbance should also affect spatial networks by altering habitat heterogeneity and resource availability. Variation in resource availability should perturb the frequency and nature of social and ecological interactions within a population by affecting the spatial distribution of individuals., In disturbed habitats where resources are limiting, spatial relationships should reflect behavioural differences among individuals, with higher-quality resources controlled by dominant individuals. In contrast, all individuals may exploit preferred resources in resource-rich habitats. Environmental variation and population reorganization may also result in variation in morphological, behavioural and ecological traits, which ultimately affect fitness., We addressed these considerations for male tree lizards ( Urosaurus ornatus) at three sites that differ in levels of disturbance. The habitats at these localities differed in the availability of live trees, the preferred microhabitat of U. ornatus. In addition, male U. ornatus exhibits a polymorphism in dewlap colour linked with differences in aggression, which should influence their position in a network and access to resources. We applied a network framework to characterize the spatial organization of male morphs at each site and quantified male aggressive behaviour in the laboratory. We also compared body size, body condition, number of bite marks, parasite load and the microhabitat use and diet, of males among the sites., We detected no significant differences in spatial network structure between unburned and infrequently burned sites. However, at a frequently burned site, the network shifted towards geographically closer, heteromorphic male neighbour associations. Males at this site were also larger, more aggressive and had more bite marks but fewer parasites than males at the other sites. Moreover, we detected divergence in microhabitat use and diet among the morphs at the frequently burned site that reflected the shift in spatial network structure and differences in morph behaviour. That is, only more aggressive morphs usurped trees and consumed prey from higher trophic levels., We conclude that environmental variation may influence animal spatial network structure. Jointly, behavioural and environmental variation may promote despotic social dynamics and ecological divergence in resource-limited habitats. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Female songbirds play an important role in a broad range of social behavior. • Female preferences are individual, malleable, and subject to social experience. • Neural regions for song appear to modulate courtship in non-singing females. Songbirds hold a prominent role in the fields of neurobiology, evolution, and social behavior. Many of these fields have assumed that females lacked the ability to produce song and have therefore treated song as a male-specific behavior. Consequently, much of our understanding regarding the evolution and neural control of song behavior has been driven by these assumptions. Here we review literature from diverse fields to provide a broader perspective of the role of females in vocal communication and courtship. Recent evidence indicates that song evolved in both males and females and instances of female song are still common. The specialized neural circuit known as the "song system," which is necessary for singing in males, is also present in females, including those that do not sing, implying broader functions that include evaluating male song and controlling courtship behavior. In addition to having flexible, individualized preferences, females actively shape their social network through their interactions with males, females, and juveniles. We suggest that by developing more accurate hypotheses concerning the role of females we may better understand the evolution and neural mechanisms of song production and courtship behavior.

AB  - Most living organisms developed the innate clock system to anticipate daily environmental changes and to enhance their chances of survival. timeless (tim) is a canonical clock gene. It has been extensively studied in Drosophila melanogaster (Diptera: Drosophilidae) as a key component of the endogenous circadian clock, but its role is largely unknown in some agriculture pests. Laodelphax striatellus (Fallén) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae), an important rice pest, exhibits a robust locomotor rhythm. In the present study, we cloned tim gene (ls-tim) from L. striatellus and investigated its function in the regulation of behavioral rhythms. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed a circadian expression pattern of ls-tim under different light conditions with a trough in the photophase and a peak in the late scotophase. After the knockdown of ls-tim via RNA interference (RNAi), the adults showed an earlier onset of locomotor activity under light/dark cycles and became arrhythmic in constant darkness. ls-tim RNAi also abolished the timing of adult emergence that normally occurs in the early photophase. These results suggest that ls-tim is essential for the light-entrained circadian rhythms in L. striatellus and provide more insights into the endogenous clock network underlying the behavioral and physiological rhythms of this insect.

AB  - Among nonhuman primates, the evolutionary underpinnings of variation in social structure remain debated, with both ancestral relationships and adaptation to current conditions hypothesized to play determining roles. Here we assess whether interspecific variation in higher‐order aspects of female macaque (genus: <italic>Macaca</italic>) dominance and grooming social structure show phylogenetic signals, that is, greater similarity among more closely‐related species. We use a social network approach to describe higher‐order characteristics of social structure, based on both direct interactions and secondary pathways that connect group members. We also ask whether network traits covary with each other, with species‐typical social style grades, and/or with sociodemographic characteristics, specifically group size, sex‐ratio, and current living condition (captive vs. free‐living). We assembled 34–38 datasets of female‐female dyadic aggression and allogrooming among captive and free‐living macaques representing 10 species. We calculated dominance (transitivity, certainty), and grooming (centrality coefficient, Newman's modularity, clustering coefficient) network traits as aspects of social structure. Computations of K statistics and randomization tests on multiple phylogenies revealed moderate‐strong phylogenetic signals in dominance traits, but moderate‐weak signals in grooming traits. GLMMs showed that grooming traits did not covary with dominance traits and/or social style grade. Rather, modularity and clustering coefficient, but not centrality coefficient, were strongly predicted by group size and current living condition. Specifically, larger groups showed more modular networks with sparsely‐connected clusters than smaller groups. Further, this effect was independent of variation in living condition, and/or sampling effort. In summary, our results reveal that female dominance networks were more phylogenetically conserved across macaque species than grooming networks, which were more labile to sociodemographic factors. Such findings narrow down the processes that influence interspecific variation in two core aspects of macaque social structure. Future directions should include using phylogeographic approaches, and addressing challenges in examining the effects of socioecological factors on primate social structure. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We examine the role of the travel time of a predator along a spatial network on predator-prey population interactions, where the predator is able to partially or fully sustain itself on a resource subsidy. The impact of access to food resources on the stability and behaviour of the predator-prey-subsidy system is investigated, with a primary focus on how incorporating travel time changes the dynamics. The population interactions are modelled by a system of delay differential equations, where travel time is incorporated as discrete delay in the network diffusion term in order to model time taken to migrate between spatial regions. The model is motivated by the Arctic ecosystem, where the Arctic fox consumes both hunted lemming and scavenged seal carcass. The fox travels out on sea ice, in addition to quadrennially migrating over substantial distances. We model the spatial predator-prey-subsidy dynamics through a “stepping-stone” approach. We find that a temporal delay alone does not push species into extinction, but rather may stabilize or destabilize coexistence equilibria. We are able to show that delay can stabilize quasi-periodic or chaotic dynamics, and conclude that the incorporation of dispersal delay has a regularizing effect on dynamics, suggesting that dispersal delay can be proposed as a solution to the paradox of enrichment.

AB  - ABSTRACT Connectivity is important for population persistence and can reduce the potential for inbreeding depression. Connectivity between populations can also facilitate disease transmission; respiratory diseases are one of the most important factors affecting populations of bighorn sheep ( Ovis canadensis). The mechanisms of connectivity in populations of bighorn sheep likely have implications for spread of disease, but the behaviors leading to connectivity between bighorn sheep groups are not well understood. From 2007-2012, we radio-collared and monitored 56 bighorn sheep in the Salmon River canyon in central Idaho. We used cluster analysis to define social groups of bighorn sheep and then estimated connectivity between these groups using a multi-state mark-recapture model. Social groups of bighorn sheep were spatially segregated and linearly distributed along the Salmon River canyon. Monthly probabilities of movement between adjacent male and female groups ranged from 0.08 (±0.004 SE) to 0.76 (±0.068) for males and 0.05 (±0.132) to 0.24 (±0.034) for females. Movements of males were extensive and probabilities of movement were considerably higher during the rut. Probabilities of movement for females were typically smaller than those of males and did not change seasonally. Whereas adjacent groups of bighorn sheep along the Salmon River canyon were well connected, connectivity between groups north and south of the Salmon River was limited. The novel application of a multi-state model to a population of bighorn sheep allowed us to estimate the probability of movement between adjacent social groups and approximate the level of connectivity across the population. Our results suggest high movement rates of males during the rut are the most likely to result in transmission of pathogens among both male and female groups. Potential for disease spread among female groups was smaller but non-trivial. Land managers can plan grazing of domestic sheep for spring and summer months when males are relatively inactive. Removal or quarantine of social groups may reduce probability of disease transmission in populations of bighorn sheep consisting of linearly distributed social groups. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Some microbes possess the ability to adaptively manipulate host behavior. To better understand how such microbial parasites control animal behavior, we examine the cell-level interactions between the species-specific fungal parasite Ophiocordyceps unilateralis sensu lato and its carpenter ant host (Camponotus castaneus) at a crucial moment in the parasite's lifecycle: when the manipulated host fixes itself permanently to a substrate by its mandibles. The fungus is known to secrete tissue-specific metabolites and cause changes in host gene expression as well as atrophy in the mandible muscles of its ant host, but it is unknown how the fungus coordinates these effects to manipulate its host's behavior. In this study, we combine techniques in serial blockface scanning-electronmicroscopy and deep-learning-based image segmentation algorithms to visualize the distribution, abundance, and interactions of this fungus inside the body of its manipulated host. Fungal cells were found throughout the host body but not in the brain, implying that behavioral control of the animal body by this microbe occurs peripherally. Additionally, fungal cells invaded hostmuscle fibers and joined together to formnetworks that encircled themuscles. These networksmay represent a collective foraging behavior of this parasite, which may in turn facilitate host manipulation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In group-living animals, the structure of social interactions among group members can have important consequences for individual fitness. Changes in resource abundance can influence social interactions with an expected weakening of social ties during times of resource scarcity. Although human activity and infrastructure often impose a disturbance on animal populations, they can also be a source of reliable resources that are relatively easy to access. We evaluated whether the social networks differed between four spotted hyaena, Crocuta crocuta , clans experiencing contrasting levels of human activity and infrastructure in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The clan living in an area of high human activity and infrastructure had a less dense social network than the other clans, and the clan living in an area with limited human activity and infrastructure had shorter path lengths than the other clans, suggesting that it had more closely associated individuals. Our results did not support substantial differences between clans in the relative social network positions of animals from different age and rank classes. Contrary to our expectations, we suggest that anthropogenic resources may have weakened the social cohesiveness within spotted hyaena clans. We also argue that our study supports previous suggestions that there may be individual variation within broader classes of rank, age and sex in the position of individual animals in social networks.

AB  - The so-called "strength of weak ties" is a central concept in social network theory, especially for understanding how information and diseases are transmitted through socially structured populations. In general, weak ties occur in networks where relatively few individuals are responsible for maintaining linkages between groups of individuals that would otherwise be poorly connected. This common structural motif can be seen in the social networks of species with fission–fusion social organization, such as giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis). Giraffe social networks are characterized by social cliques in which individuals associate more with members of their own social clique than with those outside their clique. Individuals involved in weak, between-clique social interactions are hypothesized to serve as bridges by which an infection may enter a clique and, hence, may experience higher infection risk. Here, we address this and other hypotheses explaining helminth infection patterns in wild giraffe, exploring the relative roles of the social network and ranging behavior in determining infection risk. We show that infection risk is more influenced by weak ties with individuals outside one's clique than by repeated contact with a core set of associates. Even when controlling for age and home range size, individuals who engaged in more between-clique associations, that is, those with multiple weak ties, were more likely to be infected with gastrointestinal helminth parasites. Our results suggest that diverse social interactions with giraffe from multiple cliques may increase exposure to pathogens. The importance of weak ties in pathogen transmission has only rarely been empirically demonstrated in wildlife. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A genetic survey of Barbus cyri populations from two biogeographical endorheic basins (Caspian Sea and Urmia Lake) was carried out using a mitochondrial marker (partial D-loop) in order to ascertain intra- and inter-population genetic diversity, population demography and to address their genetic structure which is the key to conservation action planning. Analyses were conducted on sequences obtained from 68 individuals collected from 10 sampling sites, from two basins. By means of morphological characteristics all specimens collected from the Caspian Sea basin were ascribed to Barbus cyri. Genetic diversity values (h and π) of sampling groups were all different from 0 (in Babolrud River population) to 0.857 (in Kalibar River population). Population connectivity and colonization patterns of the studied area were inferred from an analysis of molecular variance distribution and evolutionary relationships among haplotypes. The results point to different levels of isolation among sampling groups due to ecological and anthropogenic factors and the effect of an artificial barrier on genetic variability and conservation status of the population. Finally, this study confirms the uncertainty associated with systematic classification of Barbus spp. based on morphological characters due to the phenotypic plasticity of the species.

AB  - Social structure can theoretically regulate disease risk by mediating exposure to pathogens via social proximity and contact. Investigating the role of central individuals within a network may help predict infectious agent transmission as well as implement disease control strategies, but little is known about such dynamics in real primate networks. We combined social network analysis and a modeling approach to better understand transmission of a theoretical infectious agent in wild Japanese macaques, highly social animals which form extended but highly differentiated social networks. We collected focal data from adult females living on the islands of Koshima and Yakushima, Japan. Individual identities as well as grooming networks were included in a Markov graph-based simulation. In this model, the probability that an individual will transmit an infectious agent depends on the strength of its relationships with other group members. Similarly, its probability of being infected depends on its relationships with already infected group members. We correlated: (i) the percentage of subjects infected during a latency-constrained epidemic; (ii) the mean latency to complete transmission; (iii) the probability that an individual is infected first among all group members; and (iv) each individual's mean rank in the chain of transmission with different individual network centralities (eigenvector, strength, betweenness). Our results support the hypothesis that more central individuals transmit infections in a shorter amount of time and to more subjects but also become infected more quickly than less central individuals. However, we also observed that the spread of infectious agents on the Yakushima network did not always differ from expectations of spread on random networks. Generalizations about the importance of observed social networks in pathogen flow should thus be made with caution, since individual characteristics in some real world networks appear less relevant than they are in others in predicting disease spread.

AB  - Animals often display a marked tendency to return to previously visited locations that contain important resources, such as water, food, or developing brood that must be provisioned. A considerable body of work has demonstrated that this tendency is strongly expressed in ants, which exhibit fidelity to particular sites both inside and outside the nest. However, thus far many studies of this phenomena have taken the approach of reducing an animal's trajectory to a summary statistic, such as the area it covers., Using both simulations of biased random walks, and empirical trajectories from individual rock ants, Temnothorax albipennis, we demonstrate that this reductive approach suffers from an unacceptably high rate of false negatives., To overcome this, we describe a site-centric approach which, in combination with a spatially-explicit null model, allows the identification of the important sites towards which individuals exhibit statistically significant biases., Using the ant trajectories, we illustrate how the site-centric approach can be combined with social network analysis tools to detect groups of individuals whose members display similar space-use patterns., We also address the mechanistic origin of individual site fidelity; by examining the sequence of visits to each site, we detect a statistical signature associated with a self-attracting walk - a non-Markovian movement model that has been suggested as a possible mechanism for generating individual site fidelity.

AB  - Extinction of contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in the presence of a familiar nonfearful conspecific (social support), such as that of others tasks, can occur regardless of whether the original memory is retrieved during the extinction training. Extinction with social support is blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and rapamycin and by the inhibitor of gene expression 5,6-dichloro-1-ß-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole infused immediately after extinction training into the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) but unlike regular CFC extinction not in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus. So social support generates a form of learning that differs from extinction acquired without social support in terms of the brain structures involved. This finding may lead to a better understanding of the brain mechanisms involved in the social support of memories and in therapies for disorders related to dysfunctional fear memories. Thus, here we show that the consolidation of extinction memory with social support relies on vmPFC rather than hippocampus gene expression and ribosomal- and mammalian target of rapamycin-dependent protein synthesis. These results provide additional knowledge about the cellular mechanisms and brain structures involved on the effect of social support in changing behavior and fear extinction memory.

AB  - The social network approach has focused increasing attention on the complex web of relationships found in animal groups and populations. As such, network analysis has been used frequently to identify the role that particular individuals play in their social interactions and this approach has led to the question of whether, and in what context, individuals consistently occupy certain positions within their network. Here we investigated the social networks of guppies, Poecilia reticulata, in the wild and tested whether 1) individual fish occupy consistent positions in their network and 2) whether these positions are robust to experimental manipulations to their habitat. Our habitat manipulations involved increasing and decreasing the surface area of their pools as well as translocating an entire pool population between different pools in situ. We found that guppies did indeed consistently occupy positions within their social networks, irrespective of the type of manipulation and that individual network positions vary between individuals. Our results suggest that at least 2 factors contribute to the observed individual variation in network position including 1) the tendency to be social and 2) sex-specific social preferences. Finally, we used a simulation to explore the implications of individuals consistently occupying different network positions regarding the exposure of fish to parasites and predators. The time until infection decreased with increasing rank of individual betweenness and the predation risk increased with decreasing rank of the individual node strength thus illustrating the potential ecological and evolutionary consequences of consistent network positions.

AB  - Mixed-species flocking is an important avian social system that supports a large number of species. Current reviews of threats to mixed flocks have only examined two types of anthropogenic pressures: different land use intensity and fragmentation. We highlight the bird trade as another major potential threat for many mixed-species flocking species in Southeast Asia. We examine the potential indirect impact of the bird trade by comparing social networks of flocking data collected over two periods nearly 20 years apart (1997 and 2016) from the same site in Sumatra, Indonesia. We find that the structure of the two networks was significantly correlated. However, of the 90 species observed, 49 had previously been identified as part of the bird trade. These species experienced a significantly greater decrease in network centrality over time compared to the non-traded species, resulting in a loss of structure in the mixed-species flocking network. Simulating further disturbances suggests that flocks may not be resilient to the complete loss of two or more traded species. Our results suggest that trapping is likely to be contributing to the degradation of flocks, and ultimately could lead to the widespread declines in those other species that also rely on mixed-species flocking.

AB  - Host behavior can affect host-pathogen dynamics, and sociality is predicted to increase risk of pathogen exposure. Many species minimize costs of parasitism by only aggregating seasonally, such as during reproductive periods, but colonial species may still be limited in their potential to evade pathogens. Bats are among the most gregarious mammals and females of many temperate species form maternity colonies in summer where they communally raise pups in both natural and anthropogenic roost structures. Social network structure may differ between natural and anthropogenic roosts in ways that affect pathogen dynamics. We used social network analysis to quantify interactions of big brown bats ( Eptesicus fuscus) in a tree-roosting colony, where the colony is divided among multiple trees each day, and a building colony, where most of the colony roosts together each day. We simulated transmission of a pathogen throughout both sets of networks. We tested three hypotheses: (1) network metrics differ between pregnancy and lactation; (2) changing network structure between reproductive stages influences predicted pathogen dynamics; and (3) network metrics and predicted pathogen dynamics differ between colonies of bats in trees versus buildings. Network structure was weaker for bats roosting in trees during pregnancy and lactation compared to bats roosting in a building, and our models showed that a hypothetical pathogen would spread more rapidly for bats in the building colony. Our results are important for understanding variation in social tendencies and pathogen transmission among colonies of bats and have implications for conservation and public health. Significance statement: Host behavior, particularly social behavior, can affect dynamics of wildlife pathogens. Bats are highly social mammals and females of temperate species form colonies in spring and early summer in tree or building roosts. Thermal characteristics of trees and buildings appear to differ in ways that affect roosting behavior and social interactions. We used social network analyses to quantify interactions of big brown bats in tree and building roosts and simulated consequences for pathogen dynamics. Network structure was weaker for bats roosting in trees with more frequent roost switching and relatively diffuse contacts across the network. Our models showed that a hypothetical pathogen could spread up to four times faster in a building colony compared to a colony of bats roosting in trees. Our results are important for understanding how sociality can influence pathogen dynamics in bats and have implications for conservation and public health. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In group-living animals, allogrooming is a common, heterogeneously distributed affiliative behaviour. Among non-human primates, Barrett et al. (1999) predicted ways in which Biological Markets principles interact with competitive regimes to influence grooming reciprocity and interchange. Most tests of these predictions, done at a group level, have produced inconsistent results. Here we take a novel approach by testing these predictions across individuals within a group. This is based on the premise that in groups facing moderate-to-high within-group-competition, individuals vary in their abilities to access resources based on their competitive abilities, causing them to pursue different grooming exchange strategies. We examine evidence for grooming reciprocity and interchange for tolerance at drinking sources among adult females within a group of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) on Cayo Santiago. We test the above premise by assessing hierarchical steepness, and the relationship between individuals' David's scores (DS) and access to drinking sources. Finally, we examine the relationship of DS with grooming reciprocity and interchange to see whether they are consistent with the operation of market forces among individuals. Social network comparisons revealed that giving grooming was strongly predicted by both receiving drinking tolerance (interchange) and receiving grooming (reciprocity), despite strong associations with proximity and maternal kinship. The group showed a moderately steep hierarchy, and negative correlations between individuals' David's scores and difficulties in accessing drinking stations. Finally, we found partial support for a market-based explanation. Individuals with relatively low David's scores were more likely to interchange grooming with drinking tolerance. However, grooming reciprocity wasn't greater among individuals with higher David's scores. Our findings suggest that multiple explanatory frameworks -- reciprocity, market-based interchange, and/or proximity-mediated interchange/social bond investment -- may all shape rhesus grooming exchange patterns. Future directions include examining evidence for additional forms of grooming interchange, and the influence of between-group-competition and stress-indicators on grooming reciprocity.

AB  - Maintaining the genetic diversity of populations is important in conservation because it strongly influences the ability to adapt to changing environments. We characterised the genetic structure of the endemic and endangered New Zealand (NZ) long-tailed bat ( Chalinolobus tuberculatus) in two valleys in Fiordland, NZ. Fiordland is one of the last strongholds of the species, which has drastically declined throughout NZ. C. tuberculatus has suffered from recent habitat fragmentation and episodic predation by exotic mammals over the last 150 years. Gene flow and structuring were measured using nine nuclear microsatellite loci. In addition, the hyper-variable domain HVI of the mitochondrial control region was sequenced to analyse population structure at the maternal level. Our results show that the nine colonies studied have retained high genetic diversity, with moderate signs of genetic bottlenecks. Furthermore, low F and F values indicated that all colonies are still connected by gene flow and do not show signs of inbreeding. Substantial gene flow among colonies was also demonstrated by Bayesian clustering and PCA analysis. At the mitochondrial level, substantial differentiation between colonies has resulted from strong natal philopatry in females. Overall, our results indicate that genetic diversity is maintained in the Fiordland population of C. tuberculatus despite regular population crashes and habitat fragmentation. Management should ensure that remaining habitat linkages are preserved and further predator-induced population bottlenecks are prevented so that current genetic diversity is maintained in the long-term.

AB  - Kin selection is regarded as a key process in the evolution of avian cooperative breeding, and kinship influences helper decisions in many species. However, the effect of kinship on nonbreeding social organization is still poorly understood despite its potential fitness implications. Here, we investigated the origins and consequences of kin associations in nonbreeding flocks of long-tailed tits, Aegithalos caudatus , an atypical cooperative breeder where helpers are failed breeders that redirect care towards relatives living in kin neighbourhoods. We found that kinship is an important factor in initial grouping decisions; all members of a nuclear family initially joined the same flock and failed breeders chose to flock with their relatives. Flocks that merged during the nonbreeding season also contained relatives. In contrast to these findings of positive kin association, when long-tailed tits switched flocks they tended to disperse into flocks with fewer relatives, although such switches often occurred with kin. In a playback experiment, we found no evidence that aggression shown towards members of other flocks was affected by kinship, indicating that kin associations result from a preference to flock with relatives rather than a constraint on flocking with nonrelatives. Finally, using social network analysis, we show that fine-scale nonbreeding associations among individuals were positively related to kinship, and that these nonbreeding associations were reflected in helping decisions in the subsequent breeding season, in addition to the previously reported effects of kinship and proximity. We conclude that long-tailed tits prefer to associate with kin when not breeding, and suggest that by doing so they gain either nepotistic benefits within flocks or future indirect benefits during breeding.

AB  - For several species, refuges (such as burrows, dens, roosts, nests) are an essential resource for protection from predators and extreme environmental conditions. Refuges also serve as focal sites for social interactions, including mating, courtship, and aggression. Knowledge of refuge use patterns can therefore provide information about social structure, mating, and foraging success, as well as the robustness and health of wildlife populations, especially for species considered to be relatively solitary. In this study, we construct networks of burrow use to infer social associations in a threatened wildlife species typically considered solitary-the desert tortoise. We show that tortoise social networks are significantly different than null networks of random associations, and have moderate spatial constraints. We next use statistical models to identify major mechanisms behind individual-level variation in tortoise burrow use, popularity of burrows in desert tortoise habitat, and test for stressor-driven changes in refuge use patterns. We show that seasonal variation has a strong impact on tortoise burrow switching behavior. On the other hand, burrow age and topographical condition influence the number of tortoises visiting a burrow in desert tortoise habitat. Of three major population stressors affecting this species (translocation, drought, disease), translocation alters tortoise burrow switching behavior, with translocated animals visiting fewer unique burrows than residents. In a species that is not social, our study highlights the importance of leveraging refuge use behavior to study the presence of and mechanisms behind non-random social structure and individual-level variation. Our analysis of the impact of stressors on refuge-based social structure further emphasizes the potential of this method to detect environmental or anthropogenic disturbances. Significance statement: Adaptive and social behavior that affects fitness is now being increasingly incorporated in the conservation and management of wildlife species. However, direct observations of social interactions in species considered to be solitary are difficult, and therefore integration of behavior in conservation and management decisions in such species has been infrequent. For such species, we propose quantifying refuge use behavior as it can provide insights towards their (hidden) social structure, establish relevant contact patterns of infectious disease spread, and provide early warning signals of population stressors. Our study highlights this approach in a long-lived and threatened species, the desert tortoise. We provide evidence toward the presence of and identify mechanisms behind the social structure in desert tortoises formed by their burrow use preferences. We also show how individuals burrow use behavior responds to the presence of population stressors. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Becoming valuable to fellow group members so that one would attract assistance in times of need is a major adaptive problem. To solve it, the individual needs a predictive map of the degree to which others value different acts so that, in choosing how to act, the payoff arising from others' valuation of a potential action (e.g., showing bandmates that one is a skilled forager by pursuing a hard-to-acquire prey item) can be added to the direct payoff of the action (e.g., gaining the nutrients of the prey captured). The pride system seems to incorporate all of the elements necessary to solve this adaptive problem. Importantly, data from western(-ized), educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies indicate close quantitative correspondences between pride and the valuations of audiences. Do those results generalize beyond industrial mass societies? To find out, we conducted an experiment among 567 participants in 10 small-scale societies scattered across Central and South America, Africa, and Asia: (i) Bosawás Reserve, Nicaragua; (ii) Cotopaxi, Ecuador; (iii) Drâa-Tafilalet, Morocco; (iv) Enugu, Nigeria; (v) Le Morne, Mauritius; (vi) La Gaulette, Mauritius; (vii) Tuva, Russia; (viii) Shaanxi and Henan, China; (ix) farming communities in Japan; and (x) fishing communities in Japan. Despite widely varying languages, cultures, and subsistence modes, pride in each community closely tracked the valuation of audiences locally (mean r = +0.66) and even across communities (mean r = +0.29). This suggests that the pride system not only develops the same functional architecture everywhere but also operates with a substantial degree of universality in its content. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Connecting maternal migratory behavior with the behavior and ecology of their progeny can reveal important details in the ecology of a population. One method for linking maternal migration to early juvenile life history is through maternal chemistry recorded in otoliths. Despite the wide use of maternal signatures to infer anadromy, the duration and dynamics of maternal otolith signatures are not well understood. Shifts in the elemental ratios and strontium isotope (<sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr) chemistry in otoliths from juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) correlate with the timing of hatch and emergence, respectively, indicating a chemical marker of these ontological stages. Additionally, analysis of maternal signatures show that maternally derived <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr may be influenced by equilibration of the mother to fresh water, and in some cases the <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr signatures of the eggs can shift substantially after being laid. These results provide guidance in separating maternal and juvenile signatures as researchers increasingly target early juvenile otolith chemistry. These results also caution against the use of <sup>87</sup>Sr/<sup>86</sup>Sr alone as a marker of anadromy in populations with major inland migrations. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Heterogeneity in host association patterns can alter pathogen transmission and strategies for control. Great apes are highly social and endangered animals that have experienced substantial population declines from directly transmitted pathogens; as such, network approaches to quantify contact heterogeneity could be crucially important for predicting infection probability and outbreak size following pathogen introduction, especially owing to challenges in collecting real-time infection data for endangered wildlife., We present here the first study using network analysis to quantify contact heterogeneity in wild apes, with applications for predicting community-wide infectious disease risk. Specifically, within a wild chimpanzee community, we ask how associations between individuals vary over time, and we identify traits of highly connected individuals that might contribute disproportionately to pathogen spread., We used field observations of behavioural encounters in a habituated wild chimpanzee community in Kibale National Park, Uganda to construct monthly party level (i.e. subgroup) and close-contact (i.e. ≤5 m) association networks over a 9-month period., Network analysis revealed that networks were highly dynamic over time. In particular, oestrous events significantly increased pairwise party associations, suggesting that community-wide disease outbreaks should be more likely to occur when many females are in oestrus., Bayesian models and permutation tests identified traits of chimpanzees that were highly connected within the network. Individuals with large families (i.e. mothers and their juveniles) that range in the core of the community territory and to a lesser extent high-ranking males were central to association networks, and thus represent the most important individuals to target for disease intervention strategies., Overall, we show striking temporal variation in network structure and traits that predict association patterns in a wild chimpanzee community. These empirically-derived networks can inform dynamic models of pathogen transmission and have practical applications for infectious disease management of endangered wildlife species.

AB  - Mate sampling, whereby individuals cannot access all potential mating partners in a population, is a ubiquitous yet poorly explored process. Ignoring mate sampling may underestimate female choice because the smaller the sample taken by individuals of the choosing sex, the weaker the correlation between sexually selected traits and the mating success among individuals of the chosen sex. A main factor promoting mate sampling is the spatial distribution of individuals. Thus, including distances in models of mate choice should improve estimates of mate choosiness. However, spatial distances between individuals are pairwise variables and cannot be readily included in the models commonly used to investigate mate choice., We address this limitation by proposing a multinomial network (MN) model of mate choice, and comparing its performance with a previously published binomial generalized linear mixed model. Both models allow the inclusion of pairwise predictors, accommodating spatial distances between individuals in analyses of mate choice. We evaluated the performance of these models in detecting directional and assortative mate choice using different simulated datasets: with and without spatial information, and with and without spatial autocorrelation of male and female traits. We also took samples of different sizes from the simulated datasets to evaluate the models' performance when data are incomplete., Using both models, the exclusion of spatial information underestimated mate choice. Small sample sizes from the simulated populations led to underestimated directional mate choice, whereas assortative choice estimates were unbiased. Taking larger samples increased statistical power, and confidence interval coverage of both models. Spatial autocorrelation decreased the power of both models, but the MN model was less affected by it., We conclude that including space in analyses of mate choice increases our ability to detect and accurately estimate mate choice using observational data. The MN model is a powerful and flexible tool that should be used in studies of mate choice in spatially structured populations. Moreover, the model can be used to investigate choice in other contexts, such as floral constancy by pollinators and host plant selection by phytophagous insects. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) breeding at inland lakes in North America have experienced significant population declines since the 1960s. Although management actions aimed at mitigating effects of habitat loss and predation have been largely effective, numbers continue to decline, which suggests that the population may be limited during the nonbreeding season. Between 2013 and 2015, we used light-level geolocators to track Common Terns nesting at 5 inland colonies--from Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba, Canada, to the eastern Great Lakes region of the United States and Canada--to identify migratory routes and stopover and wintering sites and to determine the strength of migratory connectivity among colonies. Within 46 recovered tracks, we found evidence of a longitudinal gradient in use of migration routes and stopover sites among colonies and identified major staging areas in the lower Great Lakes and at inland and coastal locations along the Atlantic coast, Florida, and the Gulf of Mexico. Low migratory connectivity across inland colonies illustrates high intermixing within wintering sites, with many birds spending the nonbreeding season in Peru (70%) and the remainder spread throughout the Gulf of Mexico, Central America, and northwestern South America. While the large spatial spread and intermixing of individuals during the nonbreeding season may buffer local effects of climate change and human disturbance, the aggregation of individuals along the coast of Peru could make them vulnerable to events or changes within this region, such as increased frequency and intensity of storms in the Pacific, that are predicted to negatively influence breeding productivity and survival of Common Terns. Identifying sources of mortality during the nonbreeding season, quantifying winter site fidelity, and reinforcing the importance of continued management of inland breeding colonies are vital priorities for effective conservation and management of this vulnerable population. Los individuos de Sterna hirundo que crían en los lagos del interior en America del Norte han experimentado disminuciones poblacionales significativas desde los 1960s. Aunque las acciones de manejo dirigidas a mitigar los efectos de la perdida de habitat y la depredación han sido enormemente efectivas, los numeros continuan disminuyendo, sugiriendo que la poblacion puede estar limitada durante la estacion no reproductiva. Entre 2013 y 2015, usamos geo-localizadores de nivel de luz para seguir a individuos de S. hirundo anidando en cinco colonias tierra adentro desde el Lago Winnipeg, Manitoba hacia el este en la region de los Grandes Lagos, para identificar las rutas migratorias y los sitios de parada e invernada, y para determinar la fortaleza de la conectividad migratoria entre las colonias. De los 46 recorridos recuperados, encontramos evidencia de un gradiente longitudinal en el uso de rutas migratorias y sitios de parada entre las colonias e identificamos las principales areas de parada en la parte baja de los Grandes Lagos y en sitios tierra adentro y costeros a lo largo de la Costa Atiantica, Florida y el Golfo de Mexico. Una baja conectividad migratoria de las colonias tierra adentro muestra una alta entremezcla adentro de los sitios de invernada, con muchas aves pasando la estación no reproductiva en PerU (70%) y el resto distribuidos a lo largo del Golfo de Mexico, America Central y noroeste de Sud America. Mientras que la gran distribucion espacial y la entremezcla de individuos durante la estacion no reproductiva pueden amortiguar los efectos locales del cambio climático y los disturbios humanos, la agregacion de individuos a lo largo de la costa de Peru podría hacerlos vulnerables a eventos o cambios dentro de esta region, como el aumento en la frecuencia e intensidad de tormentas en el Pacífico que se predice que influenciarán negativamente la productividad reproductiva y la supervivencia de S. hirundo. Identificar las causas de mortalidad durante la estacion no reproductiva, cuantificar la fidelidad a los sitios de invernada y reforzar la importancia de un manejo continuo de las colonias reproductivas tierra adentro son prioridades vitales para la conservacion y el manejo efectivo de esta poblacion vulnerable.

AB  - To better understand how a nervous system controls the movements of an organism, we have created a three-dimensional computational biomechanical model of the Caenorhabditis elegans body based on real anatomical structure. The body model is created with a particle system-based simulation engine known as Sibernetic, which implements thesmoothed particle-hydrodynamics algorithm. The model includes an elastic body-wall cuticle subject to hydrostatic pressure. This cuticle is then driven by body-wall muscle cells that contract and relax, whose positions and shape are mapped from C. elegans anatomy, and determined from light microscopy and electron micrograph data. We show that by using different muscle activation patterns, this model is capable of producing C. elegans-like behaviours, including crawling and swimming locomotion in environments with different viscosities, while fitting multiple additional known biomechanical properties of the animal. This article is part of a discussion meeting issue 'Connectome to behaviour: modelling C. elegans at cellular resolution'. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Infectious disease transmission is a cost of sociality in humans and other animals. Nevertheless, the mechanisms linking social behaviour to infection risk are poorly known. We conducted a field experiment to examine how host intrinsic traits, behaviour and physiology affect infection of nonhuman primates with gastrointestinal parasites. We measured rate to reinfection in a social group of red-capped mangabeys, Cercocebus torquatus , following chemotherapeutic treatment for parasite infections. By measuring behaviour, infection and glucocorticoid levels, we compared the relative effects of space sharing, directional contact and physiological stress on risk of acquiring new infections. We found that, within proximity networks, individuals that were central, well connected and had a tendency to switch groups were at increased risk of infection with helminths. Protozoan infections, however, were acquired more uniformly across the population. In general, position in the social network and, in particular, space sharing appears to be more important than the immunosuppressive effects of physiological stress or host traits in determining risk of infection. Our results suggest that future studies of disease ecology within wildlife populations should focus on measures of network association in addition to individual host traits. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Aim Disturbance and connectivity shape the structure and spatial distribution of animal populations in all ecosystems, but the combined effects of these factors are rarely measured in coastal seascapes. We used surf zones of exposed sandy beaches in eastern Australia as a model seascape to test for combined effects of coastal urbanization and seascape connectivity (i.e. spatial links between surf zones, estuaries and rocky headlands) on fish assemblages. Location Four hundred kilometres of exposed surf beaches along the eastern coastline of Australia. Methods Fish assemblages were surveyed from surf zones of 14 ocean-exposed sandy beaches using purpose-built surf baited remote underwater video stations. Results The degree of coastal urbanization and connectivity were strongly correlated with the spatial distribution of fish species richness and abundance and were of greater importance to surf fishes than local surf conditions. Urbanization was associated with reductions in the abundance of harvested piscivores and fish species richness. Piscivore abundance and species richness were lowest on highly urbanized coastlines, and adjacent to beaches in wilderness areas where recreational fishing is intense. By contrast, seascape connectivity was correlated with the spatial distribution of omnivore and planktivore abundance. Spatial linkages between surf zones and estuaries were also important to two globally threatened guitarfish that are of international conservation significance. Main conclusions We show for the first time how vulnerable and iconic fish species in surf zones are affected by the presence of coastal cities and the attributes of seascapes in which these cities are embedded. It is possible that greater connectivity may lessen 'urbanization' impacts for species with broad diets and strong ecological links to other ecosystems - this offers new perspectives in coastal conservation, for fishes and beyond.

AB  - Both hypoactivity and hyperactivity in the amygdala are associated with perturbations in social behavior. While 60 years of experimental manipulations of the amygdala in animal models have shown that amygdala is critical for social behavior, many of these studies contradict one another. Moreover, several questions remain unaddressed. (1) What effect does activation of amygdala have on social behavior? (2) What is the effect of transient silencing, rather than permanent damage? (3) Is there a dissociation between the roles of the central (CeA) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) in regulating social behavior? (4) Can the prosocial effects of amygdala manipulations be explained by anxiolytic effects? We focally manipulated activity within the CeA or BLA in macaques by intracerebral microinjection of muscimol (to inactivate) or bicuculline (to activate) to these amygdaloid subregions. Social interactions were observed in pairs of highly familiar monkeys. We compared these effects to those achieved with systemic diazepam. Activation of the BLA but not CeA suppressed social behavior. Inhibition of either structure increased social behavior, although the effect was greater following inhibition of the BLA. Systemic diazepam was without effect. These studies, which are the first to bidirectionally manipulate the primate amygdala for effects on social behavior, revealed that (1) the amygdala, as a critical regulator of the social network, is bidirectionally sensitive to perturbations in activity, and (2) increased sociability after amygdala inactivation cannot be solely explained by decreased fear.

AB  - Social networks encompass both individual and group phenotypes that have been shown to covary with fitness in several species. In order for network characters to be evolutionarily important, they must reliably reflect properties of an individual or groups of individuals; however, it is unknown whether network traits are consistently expressed at either level. To determine if measurable components of individual social network position were repeatable and if the network structure as a whole was consistent in Bolitotherus cornutus (the forked fungus beetle), we constructed 8 experimental populations. Half of the populations were disturbed between 2 observation periods. Two individual network metrics (strength and betweenness) were significantly repeatable across time in all treatments; a third (clustering coefficient) was not. At the network level, all 3 metrics changed more in undisturbed than disturbed networks. These findings suggest that individual network position can be a consistent property of individuals that is resilient to disturbance and could experience selection in a predictable fashion. However, group network structure seems to change over time unless reset by disturbance. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Classic in vitro studies have described spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at a synapse: the connection from neuron A to neuron B is strengthened (or weakened) when A fires before (or after) B within an optimal time window. Accordingly, more recent in vivo works have demonstrated behavioral effects consistent with an STDP mechanism; however, many relied on single-unit recordings. The ability to modify cortical connections becomes useful in the context of injury, when connectivity and associated behavior are compromised. To avoid the need for long-term, stable isolation of single units, one could control timed activation of two cortical sites with paired electrical stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that STDP could be induced via prolonged paired stimulation as quantified by cortical evoked potentials (EPs) in the sensorimotor cortex of awake, behaving monkeys. Paired simulation between two interconnected sites produced robust effects in EPs consistent with STDP, but only at 2/15 tested pairs. The stimulation protocol often produced increases in global network excitability or depression of the conditioned pair. Together, these results suggest that paired stimulation in vivo is a viable method to induce STDP between cortical populations, but that factors beyond activation timing must be considered to produce conditioning effects.

AB  - Aquatic ecosystems are degraded by a variety of pressures as a result of the growing human population. Global-scale impacts include homogenization of biological communities, removal of top predators and ecosystem engineers, chemical pollution by excess nutrients and contaminants as well as deteriorating structural diversity, connectivity and process dynamics. There is a pressing societal need to reverse the decline in biodiversity and replace lost ecosystem functioning and services in aquatic ecosystems by enabling natural recovery or by active restoration., Common concepts and approaches for conservation, recovery and restoration in freshwater and marine ecosystems, aided by recent advances in ecological theory, include decision criteria on priorities for conservation, harnessing natural recovery by cessation of impacts, restoring connectivity and meso-habitat diversity as well as the geomorphological structural template including hydrodynamic processes. Re-oligotrophication at catchment or regional sea-scale benefits from integrating freshwater and marine restoration. Species or assemblages that convey biogenic structure or act as ecosystem engineers and keystone species should be given priority. Top-down control can be reinstated in closed systems., Differences between freshwater and marine ecosystems include the greater spatial restriction of many species in fresh water, the importance of rooted vegetation and insects in freshwater, and the much greater dispersal and connectivity in marine systems. These differences dictate different approaches, with more scope for active restoration work in fresh water and harnessing natural recovery in marine systems., Restoration schemes need clearly defined target states. They should generally take a process-oriented and stepwise adaptive management approach judging success against reference or control sites. Societal and political expectations need to be managed and restoration schemes should not promise too much. Even minor rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems can put back some biodiversity and key services. Sometimes ´ Ersatz´-ecosystems are better than nothing and the best that can be achieved, especially in urban settings., Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Behavioural syndromes refer to correlated suites of behavioural traits exhibiting consistent among‐individual variation, i.e. personality. Factor analysis (FA) is currently the dominant method for modelling behavioural syndromes in humans and animals. Although FA is useful for inferring the latent causes underlying trait correlations, it does not account for the pairwise behavioural interactions that also contribute to syndrome structure. Given that latent factors and pairwise interactions are likely ubiquitous causes of trait covariation, both should be modelled simultaneously. Currently, however, behavioural ecologists lack an integrative framework for describing and inferring such behavioural syndromes.Generalized network modelling (GNM), representing an integration of FA and Gaussian graphical modelling (GGM), meets this challenge. We provide a theoretical introduction to GNM as well as a method for detecting latent factors in GGMs called exploratory graph analysis (EGA). We then propose the novel EGA+GNM framework for modelling multiple sources of trait correlations and ensuring more robust causal inferences. To empirically demonstrate the utility of this framework, we compare models derived from EGA+GNM and FA using observational measures of social and arousal behaviour in common marmosets Callithrix jacchus.Using information‐theoretic model comparison, we find support for EGA+GNM models compared to models generated by FA. Two EGA+GNM models suggest that while latent factors contribute to the emergence of clustered sociability and arousal behaviours, correlations among these traits may also be partially explained by pairwise interactions. Additionally, these behavioural clusters are hypothesized to be causally linked by a positive pairwise interaction between allogrooming and activity level.These results support our claim that EGA+GNM provides a superior and integrative framework for describing behavioural syndromes. Consequently, by simultaneously modelling both latent factors and pairwise interactions, behavioural ecologists can better understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of animal personality. A formal overview of the EGA+GNM framework and a R tutorial demonstrating its application are provided in the electronic Supporting Information. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social behaviour can be a vital aspect of population viability when it influences survivorship and reproductive fitness, which is often the case for especially social species, including cetaceans. Understanding this relationship is important in at-risk populations, where knowledge of network structure can provide insight into how they may respond to human impacts., Association patterns in the critically endangered eastern Taiwan Strait (ETS) population of Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins, Sousa chinensis, were investigated using the seasonally collected (2007-2010) photo-identification data of 74 individuals., Social network structure was characterized by high strength and reach, features that are thought to be atypical for the species., Standardized lagged association rates were best fitted by a two-level model: short-term associations that dissipated in less than a day, and long-term associations projected to persist nearly 10 years. These persisting relationships were primarily among calves and their inferred mothers. The short-term associations, which were probably limiting the network's modularity, seemed to occur among more weakly associated individuals temporarily participating in large mother-calf groups., When associations were defined by proximity (within one body-length), relationships involving calves were characterized by a significantly high clustering coefficient, and some calves had high associations with other calves and more than one adult, making maternal relationships ambiguous. This could be evidence for cooperative calf rearing, which may be important for calf survivorship and initiating dyadic relationships among calves., Given their apparent uniqueness among populations of this species, the association patterns observed among the ETS S. chinensis, calves and their inferred mothers in particular, could be a response to conditions (small population size, isolation, confined distribution, and anthropogenic stressors) that make long-term cooperative behaviour advantageous. Thus, minimizing human impacts that disrupt social dynamics, such as interactions with fisheries and habitat fragmentation, should help to improve this population's long-term viability., Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Individual cages represent a widely used housing condition in laboratories. This isolation represents an impoverished physical and social environment in gregarious animals. It prevents animals from socializing, even when auditory and visual contact is maintained. Zebra finches are colonial songbirds that are widely used as laboratory animals for the study of vocal communication from brain to behavior. In this study, we investigated the effect of single housing on the vocal behavior and the brain activity of male zebra finches ( Taeniopygia guttata ): male birds housed in individual cages were compared to freely interacting male birds housed as a social group in a communal cage. We focused on the activity of septo-hypothalamic regions of the “social behavior network” (SBN), a set of limbic regions involved in several social behaviors in vertebrates. The activity of four structures of the SBN (BSTm, medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis; POM, medial preoptic area; lateral septum; ventromedial hypothalamus) and one associated region (paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus) was assessed using immunoreactive nuclei density of the immediate early gene Zenk (egr-1). We further assessed the identity of active cell populations by labeling vasotocin (VT). Brain activity was related to behavioral activities of birds like physical and vocal interactions. We showed that individual housing modifies vocal exchanges between birds compared to communal housing. This is of particular importance in the zebra finch, a model species for the study of vocal communication. In addition, a protocol that daily removes one or two birds from the group affects differently male zebra finches depending of their housing conditions: while communally-housed males changed their vocal output, brains of individually housed males show increased Zenk labeling in non-VT cells of the BSTm and enhanced correlation of Zenk-revealed activity between the studied structures. These results show that housing conditions must gain some attention in behavioral neuroscience protocols. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Network analysis offers insight into the structure and function of ecological communities, but little is known about how empirical networks change over time during perturbations. ''Nest webs'' are commensal networks that link secondary cavity-nesting vertebrates (e.g., bluebirds, ducks, and squirrels, which depend on tree cavities for nesting) with the excavators (e.g., woodpeckers) that produce cavities. In central British Columbia, Canada, Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus) is considered a keystone excavator, providing most cavities for secondary cavity-nesters. However, roles of species in the network, and overall network architecture, are expected to vary with population fluctuations. Many excavator species increased in abundance in association with a pulse of food (adult and larval beetles) during an outbreak of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), which peaked in 2003-2004. We studied nest-web dynamics from 1998 to 2011 to determine how network architecture changed during this resource pulse. Cavity availability increased at the onset of the beetle outbreak and peaked in 2005. During and after the outbreak, secondary cavity-nesters increased their use of cavities made by five species of beetle-eating excavators, and decreased their use of flicker cavities. We found low link turnover, with 74% of links conserved from year to year. Nevertheless, the network increased in evenness and diversity of interactions, and declined slightly in nestedness and niche overlap. These patterns remained evident seven years after the beetle outbreak, suggesting a legacy effect. In contrast to previous snapshot studies of nest webs, our dynamic approach reveals how the role of each cavity producer, and thus quantitative network architecture, can vary over time. The increase in interaction diversity with the beetle outbreak adds to growing evidence that insect outbreaks can increase components of biodiversity in forest ecosystems at various temporal scales. The observed changes in (quantitative) network architecture contrast with the relatively stable (qualitative) architecture of empirical mutualistic networks that have been studied to date. However, they are consistent with recent theory on the importance of population fluctuations in driving network architecture. Our results support the view that models should allow for the possibility of rewiring (species switching partners) to avoid overestimation of secondary extinction risk. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Network analysis has recently been used to delve into the dynamics of cetacean sociality. Few studies, however, have addressed how habitat shape influences sociality, specifically how linear water bodies constrain the space where individuals might interact. We utilized network and spatiotemporal analyses to investigate association patterns and community structure in a bottlenose dolphin population in a linear estuarine system, the Indian River Lagoon ( IRL), Florida. Using sighting histories from a multiyear photo-identification study we examined association patterns for 185 individuals collected over a 6.5 yr period (2002-2008). The population was highly differentiated ( S = 0.723) and organized into six distinct social communities ( Q = 0.544), spread in an overlapping pattern along the linear system. Social organization differed between communities, with some displaying highly interconnected networks and others comprising loosely affiliated individuals with more ephemeral associations. Temporal patterns indicated short-term associations were a significant feature of the fission-fusion dynamics of this population. Spatial analyses revealed that social structure was shaped by an individual's ranging patterns and by social processes including preference and avoidance behavior. Finally, we found that habitat 'narrowness' may be a major driving force behind the sociality observed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In conservation it is inevitable that surrogates be selected to represent the occurrence of hard-to-find species and find priority locations for management. However, species co-occurrence can vary over time. Here we demonstrate how temporal dynamics in species co-occurrence influence the ability of managers to choose the best surrogate species. We develop an efficient optimisation formulation that selects the optimal set of complementary surrogate species from any co-occurrence network. We apply it to two Australian datasets on successional bird responses to disturbances of revegetation and fire. We discover that a surprisingly small number of species are required to represent the majority of species co-occurrences at any one time. Because co-occurrence patterns are temporally dynamic, the optimal set of surrogates, and the number of surrogates required to achieve a desired surrogacy power, depend on sampling effort and the successional state of a system. Overlap in optimal sets of surrogates for representing 70% of co-occurring species ranges from zero to 57% depending on when the surrogacy decision is made. Surrogate sets representing early successional communities over-estimate the power of surrogacy decisions at later times. Our results show that in dynamic systems, optimal surrogates might be selected in different ways: 1) use short-term monitoring to choose a larger number of static less-informative surrogates; 2) use long-term monitoring to choose a smaller number of static high-power surrogates that may poorly represent early successional co-occurrence; 3) develop adaptive surrogate selection frameworks with high short-term and long-term surrogacy power that update surrogate sets and capture temporal dynamics in species co-occurrence. Our results suggest vigilance is needed when selecting surrogates for other co-occurring species in dynamic landscapes, as selected surrogates from one time may have reduced effectiveness at a different time. Ultimately, decisions that fail to acknowledge dynamic species co-occurrence will lead to uninformative or redundant surrogates. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Landscape complexity influences patterns of animal dispersal, which in turn may affect both gene flow and the spread of pathogens. White-nose syndrome (WNS) is an introduced fungal disease that has spread rapidly throughout eastern North America, causing massive mortality in bat populations. We tested for a relationship between the population genetic structure of the most common host, the little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus), and the geographic spread of WNS to date by evaluating logistic regression models of WNS risk among hibernating colonies in eastern North America. We hypothesized that risk of WNS to susceptible host colonies should increase with both geographic proximity and genetic similarity, reflecting historical connectivity, to infected colonies. Consistent with this hypothesis, inclusion of genetic distance between infected and susceptible colonies significantly improved models of disease spread, capturing heterogeneity in the spatial expansion of WNS despite low levels of genetic differentiation among eastern populations. Expanding our genetic analysis to the continental range of little brown myotis reveals strongly contrasting patterns of population structure between eastern and western North America. Genetic structure increases markedly moving westward into the northern Great Plains, beyond the current distribution of WNS. In western North America, genetic differentiation of geographically proximate populations often exceeds levels observed across the entire eastern region, suggesting infrequent and/or locally restricted dispersal, and thus relatively limited opportunities for pathogen introduction in western North America. Taken together, our analyses suggest a possibly slower future rate of spread of the WNS pathogen, at least as mediated by little brown myotis. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In the western US, grazing management on federal lands containing habitat for fish species listed under the US Endangered Species Act (ESA) has sparked social conflict and litigation for decades. To date, the problem has been addressed through a top‐down environmental governance system, but rangeland managers and grazing permittees now believe there is a need for more innovative management strategies. This article explores how social–ecological systems (SES) science can address rangeland management challenges associated with the survival and recovery of ESA‐listed fish species on federal lands where cattle grazing is a dominant type of land use. We focus on the Blue Mountains of eastern Oregon, where the Mountain Social Ecological Observatory Network's Blue Mountains Working Group is collaborating with diverse stakeholders to develop and test a novel grazing system designed to reduce the impact of cattle on riparian areas using an SES science approach. Although not a complete solution, SES science holds promise for improving rangeland management. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Individuals vary in the number and types of social relationships they maintain. If beneficial, social relationships may reduce predation risk and thus increase an individual's sense of security. We tested this hypothesis by studying the responses of female yellow-bellied marmots ( Marmota flaviventer) to broadcast alarm calls from unfamiliar individuals. First, we quantified affiliative interactions of animals in the field to calculate a set of social network measures. Because attributes of sociality are often correlated, we used principal component analysis to reduce our social network metrics to two unrelated factors and used the social network measure that accounted for the most variance for each principal component in further analyses. We then quantified the change in time allocated to vigilance and foraging following alarm call playback from baseline levels to the first 30 s and the second 30 s period (i.e., 31-60 s) following playback. We expected that if marmots with strong affiliative relationships felt more secure, they would forage more and allocate less time to vigilance after their immediate vigilance response to the broadcast alarm calls. Using mixed effects models that controlled for variation explained by a number of biologically important covariates and permutation tests to test the significance of social network variables, we found that marmots with a higher incloseness allocated significantly more time to vigilance in both the first and second 30 s after hearing a novel alarm call. Additionally, and while not significant (the observed parameter estimate fell between the 90 and 95% CI), marmots with a higher outstrength increased foraging in the second 30 s after hearing a novel alarm call. If we assume that time allocated to foraging is a measure of security, then marmots with strong affiliative relationships reacted more to an alarm call from a novel individual and seemingly felt more secure than their counterparts. Our results, therefore, suggest that strong social relationships increase perceptions of security and illustrate an effect of social relationships on predation risk assessment. Significance statement: In many species, including humans, there are benefits from maintaining good social relationships. These benefits include better health and greater longevity. We studied yellow-bellied marmots, a ground-dwelling squirrel that is notable because it has variable social relationships. Capitalizing on this social variation, we found that marmots that maintain strong affiliative relationships with other marmots may indeed forage more after hearing an artificially broadcast alarm call than marmots with weaker affiliative relationships. This result suggests that marmots that are more socially connected with others in their group may feel relatively more secure, possibly because they have others that can help them assess risk, and that a benefit of maintaining strong friendly social ties is that it permits animals to forage more. Thus, we suggest a new way that social relationships can be beneficial: they increase perceptions of security and this ultimately may facilitate foraging. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Albacore tuna ( Thunnus alalunga ) is a highly commercial fish species harvested in the world's Oceans. Identifying the potential links between populations is one of the key tools that can improve the current management across fisheries areas. In addition to characterising populations' contamination state, chemical compounds can help refine foraging areas, individual flows and populations' structure, especially when combined with other intrinsic biogeochemical (trophic) markers such as carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes. This study investigated the bioaccumulation of seven selected trace metals – chromium, nickel, copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg) and lead – in the muscle of 443 albacore tunas, collected over two seasons and/or years in the western Indian Ocean (WIO: Reunion Island and Seychelles) and in the south-eastern Atlantic Ocean (SEAO: South Africa). The main factor that explained metal concentration variability was the geographic origin of fish, rather than the size and the sex of individuals, or the season/year of sampling. The elements Cu, Zn, Cd and Hg indicated a segregation of the geographic groups most clearly. For similar sized-individuals, tunas from SEAO had significantly higher concentrations in Cu, Zn and Cd, but lower Hg concentrations than those from WIO. Information inferred from the analysis of trophic markers (δ 13 C, δ 15 N) and selected persistent organic pollutants, as well as information on stomach contents, corroborated the geographical differences obtained by trace metals. It also highlighted the influence of trophic ecology on metal bioaccumulation. Finally, this study evidenced the potential of metals and chemical contaminants in general as tracers, by segregating groups of individuals using different food webs or habitats, to better understand spatial connectivity at the population scale. Limited flows of individuals between the SEAO and the WIO are suggested. Albacore as predatory fish also provided some information on environmental and food web chemical contamination in the different study areas. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - ABSTRACT In deserts, amphibian reproduction is restricted to a dynamic network of small, isolated, ephemeral water sites, which support gene flow between isolated populations. Establishment of artificial catchments to augment natural water sources for target species other than amphibians (e.g., larger-bodied and more-vagile game species) can increase connectivity between potential breeding sites and populations of amphibians. These anthropogenic waters, however, may differ in quality from natural waters, with ammonia concentrations high enough to potentially affect amphibian health, reproduction, and population persistence. Thus, water supplementation has set up a potential conflict for managing landscape connectivity for sympatric species differing in dispersal abilities. To explore this possibility, we used graph theory to examine potential connectivity under current and potential future scenarios among natural, modified natural, and human-made waters on the United States Air Force's Barry M. Goldwater Range East (BMGR-E) and adjacent Bureau of Land Management (BLM) lands in Arizona. The network of 117 waterbodies on the study site (82 natural and unmodified, 35 anthropogenic or modified) coalesced at 15.7 km, meaning that wildlife must be capable of traveling ≥15.7 km from any water to the next to traverse the network, assuming all the waterbodies are in fact wet. At this threshold dispersal distance, we identified those waters that played important linkage roles in supporting connectivity through the network, 23% (5 of 22) of which were found to be either anthropogenic or modified waters, indicating that human activities play an outsized role in countering natural isolation of the waters. Two of these important waters were hubs (i.e., waters linked to a high number of nearby wetlands), meaning that the potential negative factors in a catchment could affect relatively more wildlife than in waters not associated with a hub. Because the coalescence distance exceeded the dispersal range of many smaller-bodied species, we also examined 2 smaller dispersal distances more appropriate for smaller-bodied and less-vagile species like amphibians (0.6 km and 6 km). We identified 2 wetland clusters that contained anthropogenic or modified waters. When we performed simulated removal of catchments (representing potential management action), the network showed surprisingly few effects: coalescence distance did not increase, and although the number of wetland clusters changed slightly, wetland density in the majority of clusters was not reduced. These results suggest that catchments could be removed without much negative impact on larger, high-vagility (i.e., those capable of dispersing ≥15.7 km; large mammals) or smaller, low-vagility (e.g., amphibians) species. Simulated removal of waters allowed us to generate a prioritized list of waters found to be consistently important for connectivity conservation for wildlife (large and small) on BMGR-E and adjacent BLM lands. Such an approach could be adopted in any situation where a quantitative assessment of connectivity among habitat patches and management options is needed. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Context: More than a century of forest and fire management of Inland Pacific landscapes has transformed their successional and disturbance dynamics. Regional connectivity of many terrestrial and aquatic habitats is fragmented, flows of some ecological and physical processes have been altered in space and time, and the frequency, size and intensity of many disturbances that configure these habitats have been altered. Current efforts to address these impacts yield a small footprint in comparison to wildfires and insect outbreaks. Moreover, many current projects emphasize thinning and fuels reduction within individual forest stands, while overlooking large-scale habitat connectivity and disturbance flow issues. Methods: We provide a framework for landscape restoration, offering seven principles. We discuss their implication for management, and illustrate their application with examples. Results: Historical forests were spatially heterogeneous at multiple scales. Heterogeneity was the result of variability and interactions among native ecological patterns and processes, including successional and disturbance processes regulated by climatic and topographic drivers. Native flora and fauna were adapted to these conditions, which conferred a measure of resilience to variability in climate and recurrent contagious disturbances. Conclusions: To restore key characteristics of this resilience to current landscapes, planning and management are needed at ecoregion, local landscape, successional patch, and tree neighborhood scales. Restoration that works effectively across ownerships and allocations will require active thinking about landscapes as socio-ecological systems that provide services to people within the finite capacities of ecosystems. We focus attention on landscape-level prescriptions as foundational to restoration planning and execution. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Context: Landscape and habitat filters are major drivers of biodiversity of small habitat islands by influencing dispersal and extinction events in plant metapopulations.Objectives: We assessed the effects of landscape and habitat filters on the species richness, abundance and trait composition of grassland specialist and generalist plants in small habitat islands. We studied traits related to functional spatial connectivity (dispersal ability by wind and animals) and temporal connectivity (clonality and seed bank persistence) using model selection.Methods: We sampled herbaceous plants, landscape (local and regional isolation) and habitat filters (inclination, woody encroachment and disturbance) in 82 grassland islands in Hungary.Results: Isolation decreased the abundance of good disperser specialist plants due to the lack of directional vectors transferring seeds between suitable habitat patches. Clonality was an effective strategy, but persistent seed bank did not support the survival of specialist plants in isolated habitats. Generalist plants were unaffected by landscape filters due to their wide habitat breadth and high propagule availability. Clonal specialist plants could cope with increasing woody encroachment due to their high resistance against environmental changes; however, they could not cope with intensive disturbance. Steep slopes providing environmental heterogeneity had an overall positive effect on species richness.Conclusions: Specialist plants were influenced by the interplay of landscape filters influencing their abundance and habitat filters affecting species richness. Landscape filtering by isolation influenced the abundance of specialist plants by regulating seed dispersal. Habitat filters sorted species that could establish and persist at a site by influencing microsite availability and quality. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Bacteria colonize environments that contain networks of moving fluids, including digestive pathways, blood vasculature in animals, and the xylem and phloem networks in plants. In these flow networks, bacteria form distinct biofilm structures that have an important role in pathogenesis. The physical mechanisms that determine the spatial organization of bacteria in flow are not understood. Here, we show that the bacterium P. aeruginosa colonizes flow networks using a cyclical process that consists of surface attachment, upstream movement, detachment, movement with the bulk flow, and surface reattachment. This process, which we have termed dynamic switching, distributes bacterial subpopulations upstream and downstream in flow through two phases: movement on surfaces and cellular movement via the bulk. The model equations that describe dynamic switching are identical to those that describe dynamic instability, a process that enables microtubules in eukaryotic cells to search space efficiently to capture chromosomes. Our results show that dynamic switching enables bacteria to explore flow networks efficiently, which maximizes dispersal and colonization and establishes the organizational structure of biofilms. A number of eukaryotic and mammalian cells also exhibit movement in two phases in flow, which suggests that dynamic switching is a modality that enables efficient dispersal for a broad range of cell types.

AB  - Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) combines modeling and analysis used to investigate the structure, function, and evolution of ecosystems and other complex systems. ENA is applied to network models that trace the movement of thermodynamically conserved energy or matter through the system. Investigators use ENA to answer a range of questions such as the following. What is the impact of fishing on the marine food web? Which species control the flux of nitrogen in an estuary? What is the ecological relationship among species in the food web when direct and indirect influences are considered? Would a proposed regulation make a city more sustainable? The field has grown since its inception in the 1970s, but it has rarely been systematically reviewed. This absence of reviews likely hinders the development of the field as a whole, obscures the diversity of its applications, and makes it difficult for new investigators to learn, develop, and apply the techniques. The objective of the work presented in this paper was to systematically review ENA research published in 2010 through 2016 to (1) identify the topic diversity, (2) expose methodological development, (3) highlight applications, and (4) assess collaboration among ENA scholars. To accomplish this, we used a combination of bibliometric, network (e.g., social network), and feature analyses. Our search identified 186 records. A topic network built from the bibliographic records revealed eight major topic clusters. The largest groups centered on food webs, urban metabolism, and ecosystem theory. Co-author analysis identified 387 authors in a collaboration network with eight larger components. The largest component contained 56% of the authors. This review shows ENA to be a topically diverse and collaborative science domain, and suggests opportunities to further develop ENA to better address issues in theoretical ecology and for environmental impact assessment and management.

AB  - Benzodiazepines, acting through ionotropic receptors of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, GABAR), have been shown to modify feeding behaviour and increase appetite in humans and nonhuman subjects. However, the cellular andmolecular mechanismsthat underlie connected short-term behavioural fluctuations are still unclear. In the present study, we used Carassius gibelio (Prussian carp) as a model organism to research the impact of scantily explored benzodiazepine phenazepam (PNZ) on feeding behaviour and the related molecular mechanisms of PNZ action at single-cell and singlereceptor levels.We found that the feeding activity of C. gibelio is under control of GABARs via two distinct mechanisms: orthosteric (triggered by GABA binding site) and allosteric (triggered by benzodiazepine binding site). PNZ displayed clear stimulatory effects on both mechanisms in a GABA-dependent manner. In addition, orthosteric and allosteric effects were found to be partially competitive, which leads to complex behavioural repercussions of conjoint effects of GABAR ligands. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Elevated risk of disease transmission is considered a major cost of sociality, although empirical evidence supporting this idea remains scant. Variation in spatial cohesion and the occurrence of social interactions may have profound implications for patterns of interindividual parasite transmission. We used a social network approach to shed light on the importance of different aspects of group-living (i.e. within-group associations versus physical contact) on patterns of parasitism in a neotropical primate, the brown spider monkey (Ateles hybridus), which exhibits a high degree of fission--fusion subgroup- ing. We used daily subgroup composition records to create a 'proximity' network, and built a separate 'contact' network using social interactions involving physical contact. In the proximity network, connectivity between individuals was homogeneous, whereas the contact network highlighted high between-individual variation in the extent to which animals had physical contact with others, which correlated with an individual's age and sex. The gastrointestinal parasite species richness of highly connected individuals was greater than that of less connected individuals in the contact network, but not in the proximity network. Our findings suggest that among brown spider monkeys, physical contact impacts the spread of several common parasites and supports the idea that pathogen transmission is one cost associated with social contact.

AB  - Heterogeneity within pathogen species can have important consequences for how pathogens transmit across landscapes; however, discerning different transmission routes is challenging., Here, we apply both phylodynamic and phylogenetic community ecology techniques to examine the consequences of pathogen heterogeneity on transmission by assessing subtype-specific transmission pathways in a social carnivore., We use comprehensive social and spatial network data to examine transmission pathways for three subtypes of feline immunodeficiency virus ( FIV<sub>Ple</sub>) in African lions ( Panthera leo) at multiple scales in the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. We used FIV<sub>Ple</sub> molecular data to examine the role of social organization and lion density in shaping transmission pathways and tested to what extent vertical (i.e., father- and/or mother-offspring relationships) or horizontal (between unrelated individuals) transmission underpinned these patterns for each subtype. Using the same data, we constructed subtype-specific FIV<sub>Ple</sub> co-occurrence networks and assessed what combination of social networks, spatial networks or co-infection best structured the FIV<sub>Ple</sub> network., While social organization (i.e., pride) was an important component of FIV<sub>Ple</sub> transmission pathways at all scales, we find that FIV<sub>Ple</sub> subtypes exhibited different transmission pathways at within- and between-pride scales. A combination of social and spatial networks, coupled with consideration of subtype co-infection, was likely to be important for FIV<sub>Ple</sub> transmission for the two major subtypes, but the relative contribution of each factor was strongly subtype-specific., Our study provides evidence that pathogen heterogeneity is important in understanding pathogen transmission, which could have consequences for how endemic pathogens are managed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that community phylogenetic ecology coupled with phylodynamic techniques can reveal insights into the differential evolutionary pressures acting on virus subtypes, which can manifest into landscape-level effects.

AB  - The multiple scale of stream networks spatial organization reflects the hierarchical arrangement of streams habitats with increasingly levels of complexity from sub-catchments until entire hydrographic basins. Through these multiple spatial scales, local stream habitats form nested subsets of increasingly landscape scale and habitat size with varying contributions of both alpha and beta diversity for the regional diversity. Here, we aimed to test the relative importance of multiple nested hierarchical levels of spatial scales while determining alpha and beta diversity of caddisflies in regions with different levels of landscape degradation in a core Cerrado area in Brazil. We used quantitative environmental variables to test the hypothesis that landscape homogenization affects the contribution of alpha and beta diversity of caddisflies to regional diversity. We found that the contribution of alpha and beta diversity for gamma diversity varied according to landscape degradation. Sub-catchments with more intense agriculture had lower diversity at multiple levels, markedly alpha and beta diversities. We have also found that environmental predictors mainly associated with water quality, channel size, and habitat integrity (lower scores indicate stream degradation) were related to community dissimilarity at the catchment scale. For an effective management of the headwater biodiversity of caddisfly, towards the conservation of these catchments, heterogeneous streams with more pristine riparian vegetation found within the river basin need to be preserved in protected areas. Additionally, in the most degraded areas the restoration of riparian vegetation and size increase of protected areas will be needed to accomplish such effort. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Epidemiological models often use information on host social contacts to predict the potential impact of infectious diseases on host populations and the efficiency of control measures. It can be difficult, however, to determine whether social contacts are actually meaningful predictors of transmission. We investigated the role of host social structure in the transmission of Escherichia coli in a wild population of primates, Verreaux's sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi). Using multilocus sequence typing (MLST), we compared genetic similarities between E. coli isolates from different individuals and groups to infer transmission pathways. Results: Correlation of social and transmission networks revealed that membership to the same group significantly predicted sharing of E. coli MLST sequence types (ST). Intergroup encounter rate and a measure of space-use sharing provided equally potent explanations for type sharing between social groups when closely related STs were taken into account, whereas animal age, sex and dispersal history had no influence. No antibiotic resistance was found, suggesting low rates of E. coli spillover from humans into this arboreal species. Conclusions: We show that patterns of E. coli transmission reflect the social structure of this group-living lemur species. We discuss our results in the light of the species' ecology and propose scent-marking, a type of social contact not considered in previous epidemiological studies, as a likely route of transmission between groups. However, further studies are needed to explicitly test this hypothesis and to further elucidate the relative roles of direct contact and environmental transmission in pathogen transfer.

AB  - In Honduras, where Chagas disease is a serious health and environmental concern, prevention measures face the challenge of achieving widespread and long-term sustainable adoption by communities. The article integrates social network analysis and a gender-sensitive approach to understand the role of men and women in the implementation of a community-level intervention, based on the adoption of housing improvements to reduce the presence of the insect vector. A total of 108 people in the community of El Salitre were interviewed. Data were collected on socio-demographic characteristics, participation in project activities, communication and collaboration networks related to Chagas disease prevention, knowledge of Chagas disease, and adoption of housing improvements techniques. Communication mostly occurred between the same gender individuals and was associated with knowledge of Chagas disease. Socioeconomic status, Chagas disease knowledge, and collaboration with men were associated with women adopting housing improvements. For men, however, participation in project activities, formal education, and collaboration with women were associated with adoption. These findings suggest that men and women were driven by distinct concerns, interests, and motivations when adopting new Chagas disease prevention strategies. Participatory community interventions that seek to generate health knowledge and foster collaborations to reduce health risk should address gender differences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Male relationships in most species of mammals generally are characterized by intense intrasexual competition, with little bonding among unrelated individuals. In contrast, human societies are characterized by high levels of cooperation and strong bonds among both related and unrelated males. The emergence of cooperative male-male relationships has been linked to the multilevel structure of traditional human societies. Based on an analysis of the patterns of spatial and social interaction in combination with genetic relatedness data of wild Guinea baboons (Papio papio), we show that this species exhibits a multilevel social organization in which males maintain strong bonds and are highly tolerant of each other. Several "units" of males with their associated females form "parties," which team up as "gangs." Several gangs of the same "community" use the same home range. Males formed strong bonds predominantly within parties; however, these bonds were not correlated with genetic relatedness. Agonistic interactions were relatively rare and were restricted to a few dyads. Although the social organization of Guinea baboons resembles that of hamadryas baboons, we found stronger male-male affiliation and more elaborate greeting rituals among male Guinea baboons and less aggression toward females. Thus, the social relationships of male Guinea baboons differ markedly from those of other members of the genus, adding valuable comparative data to test hypotheses regarding social evolution. We suggest that this species constitutes an intriguing model to study the predictors and fitness benefits of male bonds, thus contributing to a better understanding of the evolution of this important facet of human social behavior.

AB  - Efforts to retain ecological connectivity have become a conservation priority to permit animal movements within home ranges, allow dispersal between populations and provide opportunities for animals to respond to climate change. We used expert-opinion and empirically derived models to investigate landscape connectivity at two spatial scales among bobcats Lynx rufus in New Hampshire, USA. Paths of marked bobcats were compared to random movements in the context of program CircuitScape. At the local scale (within home ranges), the empirical model (based on observations and telemetry locations) performed better than the expert-opinion model. At the regional scale (state of New Hampshire), both models identified urban development as a potential barrier; however, the models differed in predicting how specific natural features (e.g. mountains and large water bodies) and some roads affected bobcat movements. When compared with bobcat population structure based on genetic information, the expert-opinion model overestimated the influence of roads. Alternatively, the empirical model overestimated the influence of snow. Our findings indicate that the empirically based resistance model was better at describing landscape-scale effects, whereas the expert-opinion model provided a good understanding of gene flow at a regional scale. As such, both models may be considered complementary. Bobcats were sensitive to disruptions imposed by habitat fragmentation and thus may be a suitable focal species for evaluating the consequences of land-use changes on the regional suite of mesocarnivores.

AB  - Marine predators such as sharks often form single-sex aggregations as part of their diel behavioral cycle. Such aggregations are potentially driven by contrasting reproductive and behavioral strategies between the sexes, leading to distinct sexual segregation. There is, however, no experimental evidence that such predator aggregations are governed by intrinsic social systems, demonstrating long-term temporal stability. Social network structure, temporal stability, and activity profiles were analyzed to examine the impact of introduced males on social structure of 4 captive groups of female catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula). Aside from foraging and habitat selection pressures, we question whether individual female sharks manage additional social demands that potentially influence activity budget and susceptibility to male harassment. Shark groups demonstrated marked differences in their tendency to aggregate in a unisex environment and concomitantly showed significant differences in social response to male presence. Dichotomy in social structure of the 4 groups revealed that well-connected individuals demonstrated greater resilience to male disturbance. Socially isolated females experienced greater levels of partner exchange, reduced temporal stability, and increased activity levels in the presence of males and control females. These results are the first to demonstrate the disruptive influence that male and novel females have on weak female shark social interactions; conversely, aggregations demonstrating relatively strong temporally stable social bonds (at least by some individuals) are particularly resilient to potential male harassment and novel (female) intruders. We highlight that additional ‘social constraints’ may have disparate influence on individuals occupying different structural positions within a network and may thus impact individual fitness unequally.

AB  - Gene regulatory networks, cellular biochemistry, tissue function, and whole body physiology are imbued with myriad overlapping and interacting homeostatic mechanisms that ensure that many phenotypes are robust to genetic and environmental variation. Animals also often have plastic responses to environmental variables, which means that many different phenotypes can correspond to a single genotype. Since natural selection acts on phenotypes, this raises the question of how selection can act on the genome if genotypes are decoupled from phenotypes by robustness and plasticity mechanisms. The answer can be found in the systems biology of the homeostatic mechanisms themselves. First, all such mechanisms operate over a limited range and outside that range the controlled variable changes rapidly allowing natural selection to act. Second, mutations and environmental stressors can disrupt homeostatic mechanisms, exposing cryptic genetic variation and allowing natural selection to act. We illustrate these ideas by examining the systems biology of four specific examples. We show how it is possible to analyze and visualize the roles of specific genes and specific polymorphisms in robustness in the context of large and realistic nonlinear systems. We also describe a new method, system population models, that allows one to connect causal dynamics to the variable outcomes that one sees in biological populations with large variation.

AB  - Living in a large social group is thought to increase disease risk in wild animal populations, but comparative studies have provided mixed support for this prediction. Here, we take a social network perspective to investigate whether patterns of social contact within groups influence parasite risk. Specifically, increased modularity (i.e. sub-grouping) in larger groups could offset the increased disease risk associated with living in a large group. We simulated the spread of a contagious pathogen in random social networks to generate theoretically grounded predictions concerning the relationship between social network connectivity and the success of socially transmitted pathogens. Simulations yielded the prediction that community modularity ( Q) negatively impacts parasite success. No clear predictions emerged for a second network metric we considered, the eigenvector centralization index ( C), as the relationship between this measure and parasite success depended on the transmission probability of parasites. We then tested the prediction that Q reduces parasite success in a phylogenetic comparative analysis of social network modularity and parasite richness across 19 primate species. Using a Bayesian implementation of phylogenetic generalized least squares and controlling for sampling effort, we found that primates living in larger groups exhibited higher Q, and as predicted by our simulations, higher Q was associated with lower richness of socially transmitted parasites. This suggests that increased modularity mediates the elevated risk of parasitism associated with living in larger groups, which could contribute to the inconsistent findings of empirical studies on the association between group size and parasite risk. Our results indicate that social networks may play a role in mediating pressure from socially transmitted parasites, particularly in large groups where opportunities for transmitting communicable diseases are abundant. We propose that parasite pressure in gregarious primates may have favored the evolution of behaviors that increase social network modularity, especially in large social groups.

AB  - In species that form dominance hierarchies, there are often opportunities for low-ranking individuals to challenge high-ranking ones, resulting in a rise or fall in social rank. How does an animal rapidly detect, process, and then respond to these social transitions? This article explores and summarizes how these social transitions can rapidly (within 24 h) impact an individual's behavior, physiology, and brain, using the African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, as a model. Male A. burtoni form hierarchies in which a few brightly-colored dominant males defend territories and spawn with females, while the remaining males are subordinate, more drab-colored, do not hold a territory, and have minimal opportunities for reproduction. These social phenotypes are plastic and reversible, meaning that individual males may switch between dominant and subordinate status multiple times within a lifetime. When the social environment is manipulated to create males that either ascend (subordinate to dominant) or descend (dominant to subordinate) in rank, there are rapid changes in behavior, circulating hormones, and levels of gene expression in the brain that reflect the direction of transition. For example, within minutes, males ascending in status show bright coloration, a distinct eye-bar, increased dominance behaviors, activation of brain nuclei in the social behavior network, and higher levels of sex steroids in the plasma. Ascending males also show rapid changes in levels of neuropeptide and steroid receptors in the brain, as well as in the pituitary and testes. To further examine hormone -- behavior relationships in this species during rapid social ascent, the present study also measured levels of testosterone, 11-ketotestosterone, estradiol, progestins, and cortisol in the plasma during the first week of social ascent and tested for correlations with behavior. Plasma levels of all steroids were rapidly increased at 30 min after social ascent, but were not correlated with behavior during the initial rise in rank, suggesting that behavior is dissociated from endocrine status. These changes during social ascent are then compared with our current knowledge about males descending in rank, who rapidly show faded coloration, decreased dominance behaviors, increased subordinate behaviors, and higher circulating levels of cortisol. Collectively, this work highlights how the perception of similar social cues that are opposite in value are rapidly translated into adaptive behavioral and neuroendocrine changes that promote survival and reproductive fitness. Finally, future directions are proposed to better understand the mechanisms that govern these rapid changes in social position. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The timing of raccoon rabies outbreaks in the eastern USA is non-random and often exhibits a seasonal peak. While fluctuations in disease transmission can be driven by seasonal changes in animal population dynamics, behaviour and physiology, it is still unclear which causal factors lead to seasonal outbreaks of raccoon rabies., We used dynamic network modelling to test which of three seasonally changing factors are most likely responsible for raccoon rabies outbreaks: (i) birth pulses, (ii) changes in social network structure and (iii) changes in social contact duration., In contrast to previous predictions, we found that a change in social contact duration was the single most important driver of rabies seasonality. More specifically, co-denning for thermoregulation during the winter increases the amount of time individuals spend in close contact, which in turn should lead to peaks in rabies transmission during the winter., Increased time spent in close proximity during cold winter months has implications for seasonal disease patterns in raccoon populations across a latitudinal gradient, as well as potentially being important for pathogens transmitted by close contact in other wildlife hosts., Synthesis and applications. By incorporating detailed empirical data describing variation in raccoon contacts into a network modelling framework, it is possible to determine the likely causal mechanisms driving seasonal disease patterns. This can be crucial information for wildlife and public health officials implementing wildlife disease control programmes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Floodplain productivity and inundation assessed using remote sensing indicators. • River discharge is a stronger indicator of hot spots of biomass accumulation. • Floodplain inundation and primary production are driven by flow and local rainfall. • Upstream catchment contributes to the connectivity and productivity of floodplain. • Fluctuations in climate will be key constraints on freshwater habitats. The ecological communities supported by freshwater habitats and wetlands that persist from floodplain inundation generate numerous cultural, recreational and economic values via commercial fisheries and other human uses of these habitats. However, the alteration of flow connectivity, degradation, and disruption of physical processes that sustain different levels of organisms (e.g., primary producers) are threats that affect aquatic biodiversity and the productivity of these habitats. Therefore, the large scale assessment of freshwater habitats for proactive water resources planning and the development of climate change mitigation and resource management strategies is essential. However, such monitoring and assessment is complicated by the inaccessibility of many large wetland systems during times of inundation, making in situ sampling unfeasible at a time when high levels of aquatic primary producers are generating food and energy sources for higher order consumers. To understand the physical dynamics of aquatic primary producers and freshwater habitats (1991–2019) during such times in a large floodplain river in northern Australia (Gilbert catchment), this study integrated Landsat-derived modified normalised difference water index and normalised difference vegetation index in a classification tree model. Thereafter, key hydrological drivers (rainfall and river discharge) of floodplain productivity and connectivity were assessed using a range of multivariate techniques. Results show that the floodplain had a high aquatic plant biomass during the summer wet season based on the correlation between aquatic biomass accumulation (hot spots) and inundation (r = 0.83 @ phase lag < 1 month) during such period. River discharge (r = 0.68 @ lag = 1 month) at downstream Gilbert catchment appear to be a relatively stronger indicator of hot spots of floodplain biomass accumulation as opposed to local rainfall (r = 0.57 @ lag = 3 months). While the downstream discharge explains a significant proportion of variability in the leading orthogonal mode of rainfall (r = 0.83), statistical relationships developed between discharge/rainfall and the distribution of aquatic primary producers confirm that both rivers (flow) and local rainfall are key optimal predictors of inundation and sites of primary producers with river flows being a better indicator of the latter. It is therefore argued that hydro-meteorological fluctuations will be key constraints on freshwater habitats and the growth of primary producers, albeit, human disturbance of flow can impact on floodplain productivity. As illustrated in this study, such constraints are reflected in the spatial patterns and changing characteristics (connectivity and spatial heterogeneity) of hot spots of primary producers and freshwater habitats (Palustrine, Lacustrine, and Riverine ecosystems).

AB  - Social network structures can crucially impact complex social processes such as collective behaviour or the transmission of information and diseases. However, currently it is poorly understood how social networks change over time. Previous studies on primates suggest that 'knockouts' (due to death or dispersal) of high-ranking individuals might be important drivers for structural changes in animal social networks. Here we test this hypothesis using long-term data on a natural population of baboons, examining the effects of 29 natural knockouts of alpha or beta males on adult female social networks. We investigated whether and how knockouts affected (1) changes in grooming and association rates among adult females, and (2) changes in mean degree and global clustering coefficient in these networks. The only significant effect that we found was a decrease in mean degree in grooming networks in the first month after knockouts, but this decrease was rather small, and grooming networks rebounded to baseline levels by the second month after knockouts. Taken together our results indicate that the removal of high-ranking males has only limited or no lasting effects on social networks of adult female baboons. This finding calls into question the hypothesis that the removal of high-ranking individuals has a destabilizing effect on social network structures in social animals. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Wildlife managers consider animal translocation a means of increasing the viability of a local population. However, augmentation may disrupt existing resident disease dynamics and initiate an outbreak that would effectively offset any advantages the translocation may have achieved. This paper examines fundamental concepts of disease ecology and identifies the conditions that will increase the likelihood of a disease outbreak following translocation. We highlight the importance of susceptibility to infection, population size and population connectivity - a characteristic likely affected by translocation but not often considered in risk assessments - in estimating outbreak risk due to translocation. We then explore these features in a species of conservation concern often translocated in the presence of infectious disease, the Mojave Desert tortoise, and use data from experimental tortoise translocations to detect changes in population connectivity that may influence pathogen transmission. Preliminary analyses comparing contact networks inferred from spatial data at control and translocation plots and infection simulation results through these networks suggest increased outbreak risk following translocation due to dispersal-driven changes in contact frequency and network structure. We outline future research goals to test these concepts and aid managers in designing effective risk assessment and intervention strategies that will improve translocation success.

AB  - Mixed-species groups occur in a variety of social animals and have been widely investigated in many different orders of mammals. The advantages of mixed-species groups include improved information transfer, dilution of predation risk, and social thermoregula-tion. We hypothesized that interspecific associations may be facilitated by the development of heterospecific "social" preferences. We manipulated the early social environment of captive Kuhl's pipistrelles (Pipistrellus kuhlii) and Savi's bats (Hypsugo savii), raising newborns in artificial mixed-species groups to simulate conditions in natural mixed-species nurseries. We then measured association patterns among all bats and analyzed the occurrence of social interactions by behavioral observation protocols and social network analyses. Bats preferentially interacted and affiliated with former group members regardless of species, showing that social bonding may occur between different species and that it develops after close contact with newborn heterospecifics, possibly through imprinting-like mechanisms. To our best knowledge, this is the first time such a phenomenon is documented for mammals. Although thermal preferences are often advocated to explain mixed-species associations among bats, individual experience may facilitate heterospecific groups in bats and othertaxa.

AB  - Ecosystems consist of complex dynamic interactions among species and the environment, the understanding of which has implications for predicting the environmental response to changes in climate and biodiversity. However, with the recent adoption of more explorative tools, like Bayesian networks, in predictive ecology, few assumptions can be made about the data and complex, spatially varying interactions can be recovered from collected field data. In this study, we compare Bayesian network modelling approaches accounting for latent effects to reveal species dynamics for 7 geographically and temporally varied areas within the North Sea. We also apply structure learning techniques to identify functional relationships such as prey–predator between trophic groups of species that vary across space and time. We examine if the use of a general hidden variable can reflect overall changes in the trophic dynamics of each spatial system and whether the inclusion of a specific hidden variable can model unmeasured group of species. The general hidden variable appears to capture changes in the variance of different groups of species biomass. Models that include both general and specific hidden variables resulted in identifying similarity with the underlying food web dynamics and modelling spatial unmeasured effect. We predict the biomass of the trophic groups and find that predictive accuracy varies with the models' features and across the different spatial areas thus proposing a model that allows for spatial autocorrelation and two hidden variables. Our proposed model was able to produce novel insights on this ecosystem's dynamics and ecological interactions mainly because we account for the heterogeneous nature of the driving factors within each area and their changes over time. Our findings demonstrate that accounting for additional sources of variation, by combining structure learning from data and experts' knowledge in the model architecture, has the potential for gaining deeper insights into the structure and stability of ecosystems. Finally, we were able to discover meaningful functional networks that were spatially and temporally differentiated with the particular mechanisms varying from trophic associations through interactions with climate and commercial fisheries.

AB  - We still do not know how many insect species there are in tropical forests. The rate of species description peaked a century ago. Unfortunately, taxonomy ceased to be fashionable before it had completed cataloguing insect diversity. Molecular information combined with web-based data dissemination promises to shorten the 20 years it takes on average for insect specimens to be described as new species. Our inability to enumerate tropical species has made estimates of their diversity popular. Plant-based estimates, multiplying the number of plant species by the number of insect species effectively specialized to them, have been used for the past 150 years for global insect diversity estimates and recently also for the first local rainforest diversity estimate of arthropods, at 25 000 species. Why are there so many insect species in tropical forests? Insect diversity may be driven by latitudinal trends in vegetation. The near impossibility of conducting a complete census of complex plant-insect food webs in tropical forests should focus our attention upon the most common species and interactions. Recent studies of trees in Amazonia and herbivores in New Guinea suggest that such reduced food webs may be surprisingly simple and, thus, amenable to study, while still including more than 50% of all plant and insect individuals and their interactions. A pan-tropical network of plots, modelled on the existing network of forest dynamics plots, and potentially utilizing the existing, but rather poorly used, network of canopy cranes, could provide spatially resolved data on plant-insect food webs. The study of food web dynamics requires experimental manipulation, which can range from exclusion or addition of single species to ecosystem-wide manipulation of species composition and habitat fragmentation. Recent progress in molecular taxonomy, proliferation of community phylogenies, improved food web census techniques and an increasing focus on experiments promise an exciting time for tropical entomology.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to evaluate fishing capacity by identifying socioeconomic drivers while considering the current resources state in Northwestern Mediterranean fisheries. The case-study is focused on demersal fisheries from the province of Girona (NE Spain), carried out by small scale polyvalent units and bottom trawlers, with purse seiners juxtaposed as comparison. While there has been a major effort in the analysis of vessels as means of production for estimating efficiency in fishing capacity studies, social and cultural aspects are not usually integrated in the analysis. To address this knowledge gap a more holistic capacity evaluation approach is used in this study through quantitative-qualitative mix-method to capture the economic, sociocultural and ecological dimensions that can inform more accurately on fishing capacity. For this purpose, we carried out 30 face-to-face semi-structured interviews consisting of a total of 49 open and closed questions, as primary data source. Quantitative data were analysed through data envelopment analysis (DEA) and triangulated with qualitative data extracted from interviews and participant observation. The results showed that higher inefficiency of small-scale fishing is due to, mainly, unpredictability of resources which is notably affecting small-scale fishing, whereas bottom-trawl is progressively becoming more subject to fishing specialization, enhancing its efficiency. Small-scale fisheries need to work a lot of days, diversifying as much as possible the pool of target species to remain within the production frontier. Or, conversely, they must specialize in highly demanded and priced species. An important finding is that social networks as well as knowledge is substantial in fisheries-based economies and play a role in the characterisation of fishing capacity that has to be taken into consideration. The findings are discussed in light of the objective of fishing effort reduction of European Multiannual Plan for demersal fisheries, entered into force from January 2020. • Mix-methods approach is applied for a more holistic fishing capacity evaluation. • Excessive fishing capacity is demonstrated for demersal fishing units. • Specialization on species under co-management plans shows greater efficiency. • Overcapacity is maintained for sociocultural reasons despite not being optimal. • Management policy based on effort caps is unable to address the overcapacity.

AB  - Understanding the properties of a social environment is important for understanding the dynamics of social relationships. Understanding such dynamics is relevant for multiple fields, ranging from animal behaviour to social and cognitive neuroscience. To quantify social environment properties, recent studies have incorporated social network analysis. Social network analysis quantifies both the global and local properties of a social environment, such as social network efficiency and the roles played by specific individuals, respectively. Despite the plethora of studies incorporating social network analysis, methods to determine the amount of data necessary to derive reliable social networks are still being developed. Determining the amount of data necessary for a reliable network is critical for measuring changes in the social environment, for example following an experimental manipulation, and therefore may be critical for using social network analysis to statistically assess social behaviour. In this paper, we extend methods for measuring error in acquired data and for determining the amount of data necessary to generate reliable social networks. We derived social networks from a group of 10 male rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta , for three behaviours: spatial proximity, grooming and mounting. Behaviours were coded using a video observation technique, where video cameras recorded the compound where the 10 macaques resided. We collected, coded and used 10 h of video data to construct these networks. Using the methods described here, we found in our data that 1 h of spatial proximity observations produced reliable social networks. However, this may not be true for other studies due to differences in data acquisition. Our results have broad implications for measuring and predicting the amount of error in any social network, regardless of species. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The several forms of ecological spatial connectivity - population, genetic, community, ecosystem - are among the most important ecological processes in determining the distribution, persistence and productivity of coastal marine populations and ecosystems., Ecological marine protected areas (MPAs) focus on restoring or maintaining marine populations, communities, or ecosystems. All ecological MPAs - no matter their specific focus or objectives - depend for their success on incorporating ecological spatial connectivity into their design, use (i.e. application), and management., Though important, a synthesis of the implications of ecological spatial connectivity for the design, use, and management of MPAs, especially in the face of a changing global climate, does not exist. We synthesize this information and distill it into practical principles for design, use, and management of MPAs and networks of MPAs., High population connectivity among distant coastal ecosystems underscores the critical value of MPA networks for MPAs and the populations and ecosystems between them., High ecosystem connectivity among coastal ecosystems underscores the importance of protecting multiple connected ecosystems within an MPA, maximizing ecosystem connectivity across MPAs, and managing ecosystems outside MPAs so as to minimize influxes of detrimental organisms and materials into MPAs., Connectivity-informed MPAs and MPA networks - designed and managed to foster the ecological spatial connectivity processes important to local populations, species, communities, and ecosystems - can best address ecological changes induced by climate change. Also, the protections afforded by MPAs from direct, local human impacts may ameliorate climate change impacts in coastal ecosystems inside MPAs and, indirectly, in ecosystems outside MPAs.

AB  - Coupled social and ecological systems need to be understood from a dynamic perspective in order to operationalise complexity concepts, such as tipping points, for sustainable ecosystem management. In this study, we strive to achieve this type of conceptual understanding through the analysis of the relationships (e.g. strength, nonlinearity) between the trends of ecosystem services (ES) and human wellbeing (HWB) between 1960 and 2010 in the south-west Bangladesh delta using generalized additive and logistic regression models. We use sequential principal components analysis to investigate the connectedness within the social–ecological system as a measure of resilience. We also use published literature to help develop a system dynamic framework in order to investigate how ES and HWB are interlinked. Overall, our results support previous work, which depicts that material wellbeing (basic materials for a good life) having a strong relationship with provisioning services, which in turn, show a weak relationship with the quality of life (security and health). Moreover, our analysis confirms the ‘Environmentalist’s Paradox’ that HWB has increased despite the deterioration in ES. However, our results suggest that provisioning services are not the only important reason for the increases in observed HWB, as these have also been substantially influenced by technology and capital investment (aid and subsidy). In addition, worsening trends in regulation services and in ‘slow’ variables such as climate suggest that the resilience of the overall social-ecological system is decreasing. Such changes may have severe consequences if they continue, for example, if temperatures exceed the upper physiological limits of key provisioning services (e.g. rice, fish) in the Bangladesh delta. These indicators all suggest that although in terms of HWB the deltaic social–ecological system may be successfully adapting to environmental change, it may also be close to transgressing critical ecological boundaries in the near future.

AB  - Biodiversity is threatened by the loss and fragmentation of habitats. The role of hedgerows in maintaining biodiversity is well established, but few studies have addressed the importance for biodiversity of the intrinsic characteristics of hedgerows and the quality of hedgerow networks along a spatial scale. We examined three quality indices providing information at different territorial levels: density in the landscape, structural diversity and wood production. We performed an acoustic survey in a grassland to estimate the species abundance and community composition of bats (9 taxa) and bush crickets (11 species). Using an approach based on species and traits, we assessed how hedgerow quality influenced the activity of these taxa at different spatial scales (from 50 to 1000 m) and focused on three types of traits: bush cricket mobility ability, bat foraging strategy and habitat specialization. In general, our results showed the importance of hedgerow quality for bats and bush crickets, but the strength of the association between taxa and hedgerows varied substantially among the species and the spatial scales. Although it depends on the taxa, the production, density and structural diversity of hedgerows each had an overall positive effect. Our results suggested that these effects were generally more important at large scales. The scale effect of the production index is the best predictor of activity for bat and bush cricket taxa and traits. Our results showed the importance of hedgerow quality for the ecology of bat and bush cricket communities and could be used to improve conservation management. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Many animals preferentially associate with certain other individuals. This social structuring can influence how populations respond to changes to their environment, thus making network analysis a promising technique for understanding, predicting, and potentially manipulating population dynamics. Various network statistics can correlate with individual fitness components and key population-level processes, yet the logical role and formal application of animal social network theory for conservation and management have not been well articulated. We outline how understanding of direct and indirect relationships between animals can be profitably applied by wildlife managers and conservationists. By doing so, we aim to stimulate the development and implementation of practical tools for wildlife conservation and management and to inspire novel behavioral research in this field.

AB  - Context is critical to the adaptive value of communication. Sensory systems such as the auditory system represent an important juncture at which information on physiological state or social valence can be added to communicative information. However, the neural pathways that convey context to the auditory system are not well understood. The serotonergic system offers an excellent model to address these types of questions. Serotonin fluctuates in the mouse inferior colliculus (IC), an auditory midbrain region important for species-specific vocalizations, during specific social and non-social contexts. Furthermore, serotonin is an indicator of the valence of event-based changes within individual social interactions. We propose a model in which the brain's social behavior network serves as an afferent effector of the serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus in order to gate contextual release of serotonin in the IC. Specifically, discrete vasopressinergic nuclei within the hypothalamus and extended amygdala that project to the dorsal raphe are functionally engaged during contexts in which serotonin fluctuates in the IC. Since serotonin strongly influences the responses of IC neurons to social vocalizations, this pathway could serve as a feedback loop whereby integrative social centers modulate their own sources of input. The end result of this feedback would be to produce a process that is geared, from sensory input to motor output, toward responding appropriately to a dynamic external world. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social networks are static illustrations of dynamic societies, within which social interactions are constantly changing. Fundamental sources of variation include ranging behaviour and temporal demographic changes. Spatiotemporal dynamics can favour or limit opportunities for individuals to interact, and then a network may not essentially represent social processes. We examined whether a social network can embed such nonsocial effects in its topology, whereby emerging modules depict spatially or temporally segregated individuals. To this end, we applied a combination of spatial, temporal and demographic analyses to a long-term study of the association patterns of Guiana dolphins, Sotalia guianensis. We found that association patterns are organized into a modular social network. Space use was unlikely to reflect these modules, since dolphins'' ranging behaviour clearly overlapped. However, a temporal demographic turnover, caused by the exit/entrance of individuals (most likely emigration/immigration), defined three modules of associations occurring at different times. Although this factor could mask real social processes, we identified the temporal scale that allowed us to account for these demographic effects. By looking within this turnover period (32 months), we assessed fission–fusion dynamics of the poorly known social organization of Guiana dolphins. We highlight that spatiotemporal dynamics can strongly influence the structure of social networks. Our findings show that hypothetical social units can emerge due to the temporal opportunities for individuals to interact. Therefore, a thorough search for a satisfactory spatiotemporal scale that removes such nonsocial noise is critical when analysing a social system. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - 1. Rivers are spatially organised into hierarchic dendritic networks. This unique physical structure and the associated directionality of physical flows set them apart from most other environments by regulating the dispersal of resident biota and therefore the distribution of biodiversity. 2. The aim of this special issue is to highlight the importance of the river network on structuring biodiversity, particularly through metacommunity dynamics and associated dispersal processes. 3. The issue covers a wide range of topics, including disease spread, nutrient uptake, trophic dynamics, effects of anthropogenic stressors and the joint roles of dispersal and environmental filtering. Contributions employ a broad range of approaches, including field and laboratory experiments, modelling, population genetics and conceptual synthesis. 4. Although these studies represent just a sample of the research that is being performed on biodiversity and metacommunity dynamics in river networks, several important findings have emerged; a common theme being that the structure of the network and spatial dynamics clearly influence the dynamics of populations and communities, and their functions. By taking a broad taxonomic focus (from diatoms and protists to fish), and spanning a large geographic gradient (from the tropics to the subarctic), this special issue provides a broad look at the dynamics that occur in river networks relating to their unique makeup. We hope that this selection of studies spurs additional research on these interesting, globally important, yet severely threatened ecological systems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There is a growing interest in understanding the structure–dynamic relationship of ecological networks. Ecological network changes along primary successions are poorly known: to address such topic, gradient of primary succession on glacier forelands is an ideal model, as sites of different age since deglaciation stand for different ecosystem developmental stages. We aimed to investigate the assembly processes of plant–insect networks and to elucidate its functional implications for ecosystem stability along this time sequence succession. We collected data on the functional role of anthophilous insect groups and performed network analysis to evaluate their relative importance in the structure of plant–insect interaction networks with increasing time since deglaciation along the primary succession of a debris-covered glacier foreland. We sampled anthophilous insects visiting the flowers of two models plant species, Leucanthemopsis alpina and Saxifraga bryoides. Insects were identified and trophic roles were attributed to each taxon (detritivores, parasitoids, phytophagous, pollinators, predators, and opportunists) at five sites representing the primary succession gradient. Plant–insect interactions were visually represented by a bipartite network for each successional stage. For each plant species and insect group, centrality indices were computed quantifying their community importance. For the whole network, centralization and link density were calculated. Pollinators dominated pioneer communities on the debris-covered glacier and in recently deglaciated areas, while parasitoids, predators and opportunists characterised late-succession stages. Plant species centrality varied along the succession. Pollinators showed initially higher but then decreasing centrality, while the centrality of predators and parasitoids increased with time since deglaciation. Along the same gradient link density showed an increasing trend while network centralization tended to decrease. The present study provides new insight into the initial steps of plant–insect network assembly and sheds light on the relationship between structure and dynamic in ecological networks. In particular, during the succession process, more links are formed and plant–anthophilous insect interactions change from a network dominated by pollinators to a functionally more diversified food web. We conclude that applying network theory to the study of primary succession provides a useful framework to investigate the relationship between community structure and ecosystem stability.

AB  - In several social species, adult associations have been linked to individual fitness. Less is known about offspring associations and the mechanisms by which they may influence fitness. We investigate the effects of sociality on juvenile survival in feral horses (Equus caballus). We use foal degree (number of associates) and foal weight (number of interactions) to assess sociality's importance to foal survival of a catastrophic event, the gathering and removal of 40% of the horse population. We found that 1) foal degree was a better predictor of foal survival than was foal weight; 2) following the gather, foals with access to at least one parent and some members of their natal groups were more likely to survive than were foals left with no such access; 3) foals with a higher degree both pre- and postgather were more likely to survive; 4) the influence of pregather degree appeared to be more pronounced among foals without access to parent(s) and natal group members; and 5) the influence of foal degree postgather was important to the survival of all foals, regardless of parental and natal group access. These results add to our understanding of the benefits afforded by juvenile social net- works. Moreover, our study is unique in that foals were separated from parental support at a crucial point in development. We were therefore able to separate the effects of parental behavior on juvenile response, allowing us to more directly ask the question: do the behaviors exhibited by young mammals confer immediate and/or future benefits?

AB  - Changes in synaptic strength and connectivity are thought to be a major mechanism through which many gene variants cause neurological disease. Hyperactivation of the PI3K-mTOR signaling network, via loss of function of repressors such as PTEN, causes epilepsy in humans and animal models, and altered mTOR signaling may contribute to a broad range of neurological diseases. Changes in synaptic transmission have been reported in animal models of PTEN loss; however, the full extent of these changes, and their effect on network function, is still unknown. To better understand the scope of these changes, we recorded from pairs of mouse hippocampal neurons cultured in a two-neuron microcircuit configuration that allowed us to characterize all four major connection types within the hippocampus. Loss of PTEN caused changes in excitatory and inhibitory connectivity, and these changes were postsynaptic, presynaptic, and transynaptic, suggesting that disruption of PTEN has the potential to affect most connection types in the hippocampal circuit. Given the complexity of the changes at the synaptic level, we measured changes in network behavior after deleting Pten from neurons in an organotypic hippocampal slice network. Slices containing Pten-deleted neurons showed increased recruitment of neurons into network bursts. Importantly, these changes were not confined to Pte/i-deleted neurons, but involved the entire network, suggesting that the extensive changes in synaptic connectivity rewire the entire network in such a way that promotes a widespread increase in functional connectivity.

AB  - The formation and deposition of tau protein aggregates is proposed to contribute to cognitive impairments in dementia by disrupting neuronal function in brain regions, including the hippocampus. We used a battery of in vivo and in vitro electrophysiological recordings in the rTg4510 transgenic mouse model, which overexpresses a mutant form of human tau protein, to investigate the effects of tau pathology on hippocampal neuronal function in area CA1 of 7- to 8-month-old mice, an age point at which rTg4510 animals exhibit advanced tau pathology and progressive neurodegeneration. In vitro recordings revealed shifted theta-frequency resonance properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons, deficits in synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral synapses, and blunted plasticity and imbalanced inhibition at temporoammonic synapses. These changes were associated with aberrant CA1 network oscillations, pyramidal neuron bursting, and spatial information coding in vivo. Our findings relate tauopathy-associated changes in cellular neurophysiology to altered behaviordependent network function. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A link between paternal care and territoriality has been described in several anuran species. The southern Darwin's frog ( R hinoderma darwinii) has developed a highly specialized form of paternal care known as neomelia, in which males ingest developing embryos and transport them in their vocal sacs until metamorphosis is completed. Based on the main components of territoriality described in amphibians: site fidelity, resource limitation and defence (e.g. of oviposition sites and egg clutches), we hypothesized that R . darwinii males exhibit territoriality. To investigate this, we used a multi-method approach that involved estimating home range and movements, performing social network analyses and monitoring potential egg attendance. Forty-five individual frogs and three egg clutches were monitored in a population from southern Chile between December 2010 and February 2011. Site fidelity was found across all groups (juveniles, females, non-brooding males and brooding males) based on small movements between captures (mean ±1 se; 0.96 ± 0.11 m) and small net displacement (2.95 ± 0.55 m). Home ranges were small (1.82 ± 0.54 m; range: 0.1-16 m<sup>2</sup>) and did not differ significantly among groups. We did not find evidence of male territoriality, instead male frogs exhibited high home range overlapping and intra-group association. No frogs of either sex were ever seen attending eggs. This evidence supports Wells' suggestion; territoriality in anuran species with parental care should be expected only if males defend oviposition sites. Conversely, females did not exhibit home range overlapping and showed evidence of very low intra-group association. This study has thrown up a range of additional questions with regard to temporal segregation between non-brooding males, the roles of male and female calls during reproduction, potential female territoriality and what kind of signals triggers egg ingestion by males.

AB  - The size of human social networks significantly exceeds the network that can be maintained by social grooming or touching in other primates. It has been proposed that endogenous opioid release after social laughter would provide a neurochemical pathway supporting long-term relationships in humans (Dunbar, 2012), yet this hypothesis currently lacks direct neurophysiological support. We used PET and the μu-opioid-receptor (MOR)-specific ligand [<sup>11</sup>C]carfentanil to quantify laughter-induced endogenous opioid release in 12 healthy males. Before the social laughter scan, the subjects watched laughter-inducing comedy clips with their close friends for 30 min. Before the baseline scan, subjects spent 30 min alone in the testing room. Social laughter increased pleasurable sensations and triggered endogenous opioid release in thalamus, caudate nucleus, and anterior insula. In addition, baseline MOR availability in the cingulate and orbitofrontal cortices was associated with the rate of social laughter. In a behavioral control experiment, pain threshold--a proxy of endogenous opioidergic activation--was elevated significantly more in both male and female volunteers after watching laughter-inducing comedy versus non-laughter-inducing drama in groups. Modulation of the opioidergic activity by social laughter may be an important neurochemical pathway that supports the formation, reinforcement, and maintenance of human social bonds.

AB  - Many animals form social groups, but the adaptive value of being gregarious often differs between individuals. It has been suggested that individuals who gain fewer benefits may only join groups due to constraints on resources. These individuals would prefer to associate loosely with a group, associate strongly with a few preferred individuals and avoid despotic individuals. Alternatively, if joining a group is the optimum decision due to advantages gained from cohesion, individuals may exhibit decreased preferences regarding with whom they associate. We tested these ideas by analysing the social networks of wild winter groups of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) in relation to experimental manipulation of resource distribution: three feeders 5 m apart (individuals can maintain contact with the group while also following their social preferences), 40 m apart (increased risk of losing contact while following preferences) and 130 m apart (extremely difficult to follow preferences without losing cohesion). If preferential associations are more important than cohesion, we predicted fewer but stronger connections with decreasing distance between feeders. Dynamic network analysis revealed that distance treatments did change the number of above average strength associations. However, stability of individual centrality was found to decrease when resources were close together and network structure remained similar overall. This suggests individuals maintain cohesion even when alternative foraging choices are available nearby but associate more selectively when given the opportunity. Our results indicate that while individuals will attempt to follow their preferential associations where possible, these are insufficient to cause breakdown in cohesion, possibly due to costs of losing contact with the group. Significance statement: Animals must compromise between associating with preferred individuals and following group consensus. The importance of social preferences can help infer animals' reasons for joining a group. If group cohesion brings benefits, following group consensus may be more important than individuals' social preferences. Alternatively, if groups form simply due to lack of resources, following social preferences may be more important than maintaining group cohesion, depending on the costs of losing contact with the group. We examined this by looking at social network structure of black-capped chickadees in relation to resource distribution, expecting changes in network structure as it became easier or harder to exhibit social preferences. We found individuals had fewer strong associations when resources were closer, meaning that networks were more differentiated than when resources were further apart. This suggests that individuals associated more selectively when possible, though this did not appear to change overall network structure. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social network analysis (SNA) has become a widespread tool for the study of animal social organisation. However despite this broad applicability, SNA is currently limited by both an overly strong focus on pattern analysis as well as a lack of dynamic interaction models. Here, we use a dynamic modelling approach that can capture the responses of social networks to changing environments. Using the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, we identified the general properties of the social dynamics underlying fish social networks and found that they are highly robust to differences in population density and habitat changes. Movement simulations showed that this robustness could buffer changes in transmission processes over a surprisingly large density range. These simulation results suggest that the ability of social systems to self-stabilise could have important implications for the spread of infectious diseases and information. In contrast to habitat manipulations, social manipulations (e.g. change of sex ratios) produced strong, but short-lived, changes in network dynamics. Lastly, we discuss how the evolution of the observed social dynamics might be linked to predator attack strategies. We argue that guppy social networks are an emergent property of social dynamics resulting from predator-prey co-evolution. Our study highlights the need to develop dynamic models of social networks in connection with an evolutionary framework. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Extended phenotypes offer a unique opportunity to experimentally manipulate and identify sources of selection acting on traits under natural conditions. The social cichlid fish Neolamprologus multifasciatus builds nests by digging up aquatic snail shells, creating an extended sexual phenotype that is highly amenable to experimental manipulation through addition of extra shells. Here, we find sources of both positive sexual selection and opposing natural selection acting on this trait; augmenting shell nests increases access to mates, but also increases social aggression and predation risk. Increasing the attractiveness of one male also changed social interactions throughout the social network and altered the entire community structure. Manipulated males produced and received more displays from neighbouring females, who also joined augmented male territories at higher rates than unmanipulated groups. However, males in more attractive territories received more aggression from neighbouring males, potentially as a form of social policing. We also detected a significant ecological cost of the 'over-extended' phenotype; heterospecific predators usurped augmented nests at higher rates, using them as breeding sites and displacing residents. Using these natural experiments, we find that both social and ecological interactions generate clear sources of selection mediating the expression of an extended phenotype in the wild.

AB  - Hydrological connectivity regulates the structure and function of Amazonian freshwater ecosystems and the provisioning of services that sustain local populations. This connectivity is increasingly being disrupted by the construction of dams, mining, land-cover changes, and global climate change. This review analyzes these drivers of degradation, evaluates their impacts on hydrological connectivity, and identifies policy deficiencies that hinder freshwater ecosystem protection. There are 154 large hydroelectric dams in operation today, and 21 dams under construction. The current trajectory of dam construction will leave only three free-flowing tributaries in the next few decades if all 277 planned dams are completed. Land-cover changes driven by mining, dam and road construction, agriculture and cattle ranching have already affected ~20% of the Basin and up to ~50% of riparian forests in some regions. Global climate change will likely exacerbate these impacts by creating warmer and dryer conditions, with less predictable rainfall and more extreme events (e.g., droughts and floods). The resulting hydrological alterations are rapidly degrading freshwater ecosystems, both independently and via complex feedbacks and synergistic interactions. The ecosystem impacts include biodiversity loss, warmer stream temperatures, stronger and more frequent floodplain fires, and changes to biogeochemical cycles, transport of organic and inorganic materials, and freshwater community structure and function. The impacts also include reductions in water quality, fish yields, and availability of water for navigation, power generation, and human use. This degradation of Amazonian freshwater ecosystems cannot be curbed presently because existing policies are inconsistent across the Basin, ignore cumulative effects, and overlook the hydrological connectivity of freshwater ecosystems. Maintaining the integrity of these freshwater ecosystems requires a basinwide research and policy framework to understand and manage hydrological connectivity across multiple spatial scales and jurisdictional boundaries.

AB  - Animal social networks are descriptions of social structure which, aside from their intrinsic interest for understanding sociality, can have significant bearing across many fields of biology., Network analysis provides a flexible toolbox for testing a broad range of hypotheses, and for describing the social system of species or populations in a quantitative and comparable manner. However, it requires careful consideration of underlying assumptions, in particular differentiating real from observed networks and controlling for inherent biases that are common in social data., We provide a practical guide for using this framework to analyse animal social systems and test hypotheses. First, we discuss key considerations when defining nodes and edges, and when designing methods for collecting data. We discuss different approaches for inferring social networks from these data and displaying them. We then provide an overview of methods for quantifying properties of nodes and networks, as well as for testing hypotheses concerning network structure and network processes. Finally, we provide information about assessing the power and accuracy of an observed network., Alongside this manuscript, we provide appendices containing background information on common programming routines and worked examples of how to perform network analysis using the r programming language., We conclude by discussing some of the major current challenges in social network analysis and interesting future directions. In particular, we highlight the under-exploited potential of experimental manipulations on social networks to address research questions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The neural mechanisms regulating social behaviour have received extensive attention in recent years, with much focus on ‘complex’ forms of sociality. Comparatively little research has addressed fundamental social behaviour, such as grouping, which impacts multiple determinants of fitness, such as foraging and avoiding predation. We are interested in the degree to which brain areas that regulate other forms of sociality are also involved in grouping behaviour, and so we investigated shoal-elicited activation of the brain in the guppy ( Poecilia reticulata ). Guppies are small, social fish that live in the rivers of Trinidad and, like many social fish, exhibit preferences for larger shoals. We first confirmed that our study population of wild-type guppies preferred to join a larger shoal, and then investigated the activation of four brain regions proposed to be involved in social behaviour and reward (the preoptic area, the dorsal part of the ventral telencephalon, the ventral part of the ventral telencephalon, and the supracommissural part of the ventral pallium). Subjects were exposed to a large shoal, a small shoal, or to a tank empty of conspecifics, and we used immediate early gene expression (egr-1) to assess neuronal activation. We found increased activation in the preoptic area when fish were exposed to a large shoal compared to controls that had no social exposure. There were no significant differences in activation within the other brain areas examined, possibly because these brain areas are not key regulators of grouping behaviour or have only a secondary role. The higher activation of the preoptic area during social exposure suggests functional homology in this highly-conserved region across all vertebrates. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In the analysis of animal social networks, a common challenge has been distinguishing affiliations - active preferences of pairs of individuals to interact or associate with one another - from other, structural, causes of association or interaction. Such structural factors can include patterns of use of the habitat in time and space, gregariousness and differential association rates among age/sex classes., In an approach with similarities to the multiple regression quadratic assignment procedures test, we suggest calculating generalized affiliation indices as the residuals from a regression of the measures of association or interaction on structural predictor variables, such as gregariousness and spatiotemporal overlap. If the original data are association indices or counts of interactions, then generalized linear models with binomial or Poisson error structures, respectively, can be used in place of linear regression. Anscombe or deviance residuals can be used to assess the significance of particular affiliation indices., Generalized affiliation indices can be used as the weights of links in a social network representation. They can then be portrayed in network diagrams or cluster diagrams and used to calculate network statistics, to delineate communities by maximizing modularity and to test for overall affiliation using data-stream permutation tests., We evaluate the effectiveness of such generalized affiliation indices using simulated and real association data, finding that the method removes much of the effect of structural variables on association patterns, revealing real affiliations. While the approach is very promising, it is limited by the extent to which the input predictor variables represent important structural factors. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social relationships have been shown to significantly impact individual and group success in wild animal populations, but are largely ignored in farm animal management. There are substantial gaps in our knowledge of how farm animals respond to their social environment, which varies greatly between farms but is commonly unstable due to regrouping. Fundamental to addressing these gaps is an understanding of the social network structure resulting from the patterning of relationships between individuals in a group. Here, we investigated the social structure of a group of 110 lactating dairy cows during four one-month periods. Spatial proximity loggers collected data on associations between cows, allowing us to construct social networks. First we demonstrate that proximity loggers can be used to measure relationships between cows; proximity data was significantly positively correlated to affiliative interactions but had no relationship with agonistic interactions. We measured group-level patterns by testing for community structure, centralisation and repeatability of network structure over time. We explored individual-level patterns by measuring social differentiation (heterogeneity of social associations) and assortment of cows in the network by lactation number, breed, gregariousness and milk production. There was no evidence that cows were subdivided into social communities; individuals belonged to a single cluster and networks showed significant centralisation. Repeatability of the social network was low, which may have consequences for animal welfare. Individuals formed differentiated social relation-ships and there was evidence of positive assortment by traits; cows associated more with conspecifics of similar lactation number in all study periods. There was also positive assortment by breed, gregariousness and milk production in some study periods. There is growing interest in the farming industry in the impact of social factors on production and welfare; this study takes an important step towards understanding social dynamics.

AB  - Infectious disease transmission often depends on the contact structure of host populations. Although it is often challenging to capture the contact structure in wild animals, new technology has enabled biologists to obtain detailed temporal information on wildlife social contacts. In this study, we investigated the effects of raccoon contact patterns on rabies spread using network modelling., Raccoons ( Procyon lotor) play an important role in the maintenance of rabies in the United States. It is crucial to understand how contact patterns influence the spread of rabies in raccoon populations in order to design effective control measures and to prevent transmission to human populations and other animals., We constructed a dynamic system of contact networks based on empirical data from proximity logging collars on a wild suburban raccoon population and then simulated rabies spread across these networks. Our contact networks incorporated the number and duration of raccoon interactions. We included differences in contacts according to sex and season, and both short-term acquaintances and long-term associations. Raccoons may display different behaviours when infectious, including aggression (furious behaviour) and impaired mobility (dumb behaviour); the network model was used to assess the impact of potential behavioural changes in rabid raccoons. We also tested the effectiveness of different vaccination coverage levels., Our results demonstrate that when rabies enters a suburban raccoon population, the likelihood of a disease outbreak affecting the majority of the population is high. Both the magnitude of rabies outbreaks and the speed of rabies spread depend strongly on the time of year that rabies is introduced into the population. When there is a combination of dumb and furious behaviours in the rabid raccoon population, there are similar outbreak sizes and speed of spread to when there are no behavioural changes due to rabies infection., By incorporating detailed data describing the variation in raccoon contact rates into a network modelling approach, we were able to show that suburban raccoon populations are highly susceptible to rabies outbreaks, that the risk of large outbreaks varies seasonally and that current vaccination target levels may be inadequate to prevent the spread of rabies within these populations. Our findings provide new insights into rabies dynamics in raccoon populations and have important implications for disease control. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Wildlife management actions can alter fundamental behaviors of individuals and groups, which may directly impact their life history parameters in unforeseen ways. This is especially true for highly social animals because changes in one individual's behavior can cascade throughout its social network. When resources to support populations of social animals are limited and populations become locally overabundant, managers are faced with the daunting challenge of decreasing population size without disrupting core behavioral processes. Increasingly, managers are turning to fertility control technologies to supplement culling in efforts to suppress population growth, but little is quantitatively known about how either of these management tools affects behavior. Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) is a small neuropeptide that performs an obligatory role in mammalian reproduction and has been formulated into the immunocontraceptive GonaCon-B™. We investigated the influences of this vaccine on behavior of feral horses (Equus caballus) at Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North Dakota, USA, for a year preceding and a year following nonlethal culling and GnRH-vaccine treatment. We observed horses during the breeding season and found only minimal differences in time budget behaviors of free-ranging female feral horses treated with GnRH and those treated with saline. The differences observed were consistent with the metabolic demands of pregnancy and lactation. We observed similar social behaviors between treatment groups, reflecting limited reproductive behavior among control females due to high rates of pregnancy and suppressed reproductive behavior among treated females due to GnRH-inhibited ovarian activity. In the treatment year, band stallion age was the only supported factor influencing herding behavior (P<0.001), harem-tending behavior (P<0.001), and agonistic behavior (P=0.02). There was no difference between the mean body condition of control females (4.9 (95% CI=4.7-5.1)) and treated females (4.8 (95% CI=4.7-4.9)). Band fidelity among all females increased 25.7% in the year following vaccination and culling, despite the social perturbation associated with removal of conspecifics. Herding behavior by stallions decreased 50.7% following treatment and culling (P<0.001), while harem-tending behavior increased 195.0% (P<0.001). The amount of available forage influenced harem-tending, reproductive, and agonistic behavior in the year following culling and treatment (P<0.04). These changes reflected the expected nexus between a species with polygynous social structure and strong group fidelity and the large instantaneous change in population density and demography coincident with culling. Behavioral responses to such perturbation may be synergistic in reducing grazing pressure by decreasing energetically expensive competitive behaviors, but further investigation is needed to explicitly test this hypothesis.

AB  - Context: Functional connectivity-the facilitation of individual movements among habitat patches-is essential for species' persistence in fragmented landscapes. Evaluating functional connectivity is critical for predicting range shifts, developing conservation plans, and anticipating effects of disturbance, especially for species affected by climate change. Objectives: We examined whether simplifying forest structure influenced animal movements and whether an experimental approach to quantifying functional connectivity reflects normal behavior, which is often assumed but remains untested. Methods: We evaluated functional connectivity for Pacific marten ( Martes caurina) across a gradient in forest structural complexity using two novel methods for this species: incentivized food-titration experiments and non-incentivized locations collected via GPS telemetry (24 individuals). Results: Food titration experiments revealed martens selected complex stands, and martens entered and crossed areas with reduced forest cover when motivated by bait, particularly in the winter. However, our telemetry data showed that without such incentive, martens avoided openings and simple stands and selected complex forest stands equally during summer and winter. Conclusions: Detections at baited stations may not represent typical habitat preferences during winter, and incentivized experiments reflect the capacity of martens to enter non-preferred stand types under high motivation (e.g., hunger, curiosity, dispersal). We hypothesize snow cover facilitates connectivity across openings when such motivation is present; thus, snow cover may benefit dispersing animals and increase population connectivity. Landscapes with joined networks of complex stands are crucial for maintaining functional connectivity for marten, particularly during summer. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Recognising social partners allows individuals to establish social networks with one another, informs mating decisions, and decreases energy expenditure. Studies rarely examine if females have this ability outside of mate choice. Additionally, it is unknown if familiarity differs when females encounter females versus males. Female Siamese fighting fish were placed into one of six treatment groups that differed based on the sex of the interactant (female or male) and experience (familiar, unfamiliar or no previous exposure). In both female-female and female-male interactions, less behaviour was performed towards familiar individuals. However, the degree to which familiarity had an effect differed depending on the sex of the interactant and the behaviour measured. Familiarity may serve an important function if it increases an individual's ability to remember the outcome of prior encounters and use this information in later encounters with the same individual. To fully understand social dynamics, both sexes must be examined. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The effectiveness of animal health surveillance systems depends on their capacity to gather sanitary information from the animal production sector. In order to assess this capacity we analyzed the flow of sanitary information regarding Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) suspicions in poultry in Vietnam. Participatory methods were applied to assess the type of actors and likelihood of information sharing between actors in case of HPAI suspicion in poultry. While the reporting of HPAI suspicions is mandatory, private actors had more access to information than public actors. Actors of the upstream sector (medicine and feed sellers) played a key role in the diffusion of information. The central role of these actors and the influence of the information flow on the adoption by poultry production stakeholders of behaviors limiting (e.g. prevention measures) or promoting disease transmission (e.g. increased animal movements) should be accounted for in the design of surveillance and control programs.

AB  - Social learning, whereby animals learn from others, mediates the spread of information through social networks. To make this process adaptive, animals should be selective with respect to when and whom to copy. The cost of decision making can be curbed by cognitive biases favouring particular categories of individuals. Such model biases are well documented, but few, if any, experimental studies have addressed potential developmental causes of this variation. We therefore tested whether and how the postnatal environment affected social-learning preferences in a known social learner the zebra finch, Taeniopygia guttata. Birds from experimentally manipulated brood sizes, a treatment known to affect adult phenotypic quality in this species, were tested in an established observer–demonstrator paradigm. Naïve observers could watch unfamiliar same-sex conspecifics feed from differently coloured novel feeders. When subsequently allowed to choose between identical feeders, postnatal conditions (=rearing brood size) had strong effects on who copied whom in adulthood: males preferred the feeders of demonstrators from large brood sizes, females those of demonstrators from brood sizes matching their own, suggesting stratified information transfer within foraging groups. Our results demonstrate how individuals'' developmental history can explain substantial interindividual variation in model biases and ensuing structured information transfer within groups.

AB  - Understanding the spatial structuring of animal behaviors and how they link landscapes can be critical for conservation management. This emerging field has been greatly facilitated by technologically advanced acquisition and analysis of data on animal movements. The framework of graph theory, which directly quantifies network connectivity properties, provides a useful addition to this tool set. Using a novel application of graph theory, we investigate the structure and patterning of African elephant Loxodonta africana rest sites, a potentially critical feature structuring spatial properties of animal populations. Elephants in the study rested intermittently and for short durations (1-3 rests d<sup>-1</sup>, lasting 3-5 h total). They switched circadian rest patterns according to landscape attributes, resting more during the day and further from permanent water in areas with high human density outside protected areas. Within protected areas and during the dry season, elephants showed clustering and sequential use of rest nodes (repeated motifs). Repeated use of specific rest nodes (self-looping) was more frequent than expected if rest nodes were chosen at random, particularly when outside protected areas further from water, indicating the importance of preferred rest sites. Our results suggest that elephants adjust resting behavior when in human-dominated areas, using preferred resting sites presumably in locations that reduce the risk of interactions. This study demonstrates how graph theory may be used practically to gain novel insight into behaviours, such as resting, that are discrete in time and space. Furthermore, analysis of the spatial and network properties of rest sites, given an individual's susceptibility when engaged in rest behavior, allowed characterization of spatio-temporal risk perception, providing a powerful behavioral based means to quantify the landscape of fear.

AB  - The One Health initiative is a global effort fostering interdisciplinary collaborations to address challenges in human, animal, and environmental health. While One Health has received considerable press, its benefits remain unclear because its effects have not been quantitatively described. We systematically surveyed the published literature and used social network analysis to measure interdisciplinarity in One Health studies constructing dynamic pathogen transmission models. The number of publications fulfilling our search criteria increased by 14.6% per year, which is faster than growth rates for life sciences as a whole and for most biology subdisciplines. Surveyed publications clustered into three communities: one used by ecologists, one used by veterinarians, and a third diverse-authorship community used by population biologists, mathematicians, epidemiologists, and experts in human health. Overlap between these communities increased through time in terms of author number, diversity of co-author affiliations, and diversity of citations. However, communities continue to differ in the systems studied, questions asked, and methods employed. While the infectious disease research community has made significant progress toward integrating its participating disciplines, some segregation—especially along the veterinary/ecological research interface—remains.

AB  - ABSTRACT A hallmark assumption of traditional approaches to disease modelling is that individuals within a given population mix uniformly and at random. However, this assumption does not always hold true; contact heterogeneity or preferential associations can have a substantial impact on the duration, size, and dynamics of epidemics. Contact heterogeneity has been readily adopted in epidemiological studies of humans, but has been less studied in wildlife. While contact network studies are becoming more common for wildlife, their methodologies, fundamental assumptions, host species, and parasites vary widely. The goal of this article is to review how contact networks have been used to study macro- and microparasite transmission in wildlife. The review will: ( i) explain why contact heterogeneity is relevant for wildlife populations; ( ii) explore theoretical and applied questions that contact networks have been used to answer; ( iii) give an overview of unresolved methodological issues; and ( iv) suggest improvements and future directions for contact network studies in wildlife.

AB  - Habitat connectivity influences the distribution dynamics of animals. Connectivity can therefore shape trophic interactions, but little empirical evidence is available, especially for large mammals. In forest ecosystems, logging alters functional connectivity among habitat patches, and such activities can affect the spatial game between large herbivores and their predators. We used graph theory to evaluate how harvesting-induced changes in habitat connectivity influence patch choice and residency time of GPS-collared caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) and moose (Alces alces) in winter in the boreal forest. We then investigated the predator-prey game by assessing how GPS-collared wolves (Cants lupus) adjusted their movements to changes in landscape properties and in the networks of their prey species. We built prey habitat networks using minimum planar graphs organized around species-specific, highly selected habitat patches (i.e., network nodes). We found that spatial dynamics of large herbivores were influenced not only by the intrinsic quality of habitat patches, but also by the connectivity of those network nodes. Caribou and moose selected nodes that were connected by a high number of links, and moose also spent relatively more time in those nodes. By limiting node accessibility, human disturbances influenced travel decisions. Caribou and moose avoided nodes that were surrounded by a high proportion of cuts and roads, but once within these nodes, moose stayed longer than in other nodes. Caribou selectively moved among nodes with low distance costs, and their residency time increased with distance costs required to reach the nodes. Wolves selected their prey's nodes, where vegetation consumed by caribou and moose was highly abundant. Furthermore, wolves discriminated among those nodes by selecting the most connected ones. In fact, selection by wolves was stronger for their prey's nodes than for the prey's utilization distribution per se, a difference that increased with the level of human disturbance. Considering the difficulty of keeping track of highly mobile prey, predators may benefit by targeting not only their prey's resource patches, but also the most highly connected patches. Matrix quality and connectivity are therefore key elements shaping the predator-prey spatial game in human-altered landscapes because of their impact on the spatial dynamics of the interacting species.

AB  - Understanding how animal social relationships are created, maintained and severed has ecological and evolutionary significance. Animal social relationships are inferred from observations of interactions between animals; the pattern of interaction over time indicates the existence (or absence) of a social relationship. Autonomous behavioural recording technologies are increasingly being used to collect continuous interaction data on animal associations. However, continuous data sequences are typically aggregated to represent a relationship as part of one (or several) pictures of the network of relations among animals, in a way that parallels human social networks. This transformation entails loss of information about interaction timing and sequence, which are particularly important to understand the formation of relationships or their disruption. Here, we describe a new statistical model, termed the relational event model, that enables the analysis of fine-grained animal association data as a continuous time sequence without requiring aggregation of the data. We apply the model to a unique data set of interaction between familiar and unfamiliar steers during a series of 36 experiments to investigate the process of social disruption and relationship formation. We show how the model provides key insights into animal behaviour in terms of relationship building, the integration process of unfamiliar animals and group building dynamics. The relational event model is well suited to data structures that are common to animal behavioural studies and can therefore be applied to a range of social interaction data to understand animal social dynamics.

AB  - The spinal locomotor networks controlling swimming behavior in larval and adult lampreys may have some important differences. As an initial step in comparing the locomotor systems in lampreys, in larval animals the relative timing of locomotor movements and muscle burst activity were determined and compared to those previously published for adults. In addition, the kinematics for free swimming in larval and adult lampreys was compared in detail for the first time. First, for swimming in larval animals, the neuromechanical phase lag between the onsets or terminations of muscle burst activity and maximum concave curvature of the body increased with increasing distance along the body, similar to that previously shown in adults. Second, in larval lampreys, but not adults, absolute swimming speed (U;mms<sup>-1</sup>) increased with animal length (L). In contrast, normalized swimming speed (U′; body lengths [bl] s<sup>-1</sup>) did not increase with L in larval or adult animals. In both larval and adult lampreys, U′ and normalized wave speed (U′) increased with increasing tail-beat frequency. Wavelength and mechanical phase lag did not vary significantly with tail-beat frequency but were significantly different in larval and adult animals. Swimming in larval animals was characterized by a smaller U/V ratio, Froude efficiency, and Strouhal number than in adults, suggesting less efficient swimming for larval animals. In addition, during swimming in larval lampreys, normalized lateral headmovements were larger and normalized lateral tail movements were smaller than for adults. Finally, larval animals had proportionally smaller lateral surface areas of the caudal body and fin areas than adults. These differences are well suited for larval sea lampreys that spend most of the time buried in mud/sand, in which swimming efficiency is not critical, compared to adults that would experience significant selection pressure to evolve higher-efficiency swimming to catch up to and attach to fish for feeding as well as engage in long-distance migration during spawning. Finally, the differences in swim efficiency for larval and adult lampreys are compared to other animals employing the anguilliform mode of swimming. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social network analysis has produced important insights regarding the causes and consequences of animal social structure. Social structure has been shown to impact longevity, reproductive success, transmission of pathogens and information, and also play important role in the evolution of cooperation. Studies of the determinants of social structure have identified environmental, genetic, and structural factors in a variety of species. At the same time, most studies in the field have been descriptive in approach, statistically identifying patterns in social networks constructed from observed interactions. We argue that there is a need for predictive theory to complement descriptive studies, moving the field from pattern to process. As an example, we provide a simple model of the effect of personality on social network structure and social role differentiation. Our model suggests that variation in behavioral types can result in variation in individual social network traits, and that some patterns found in animal networks in the wild, such as assortativity with respect to personality, may be outcomes of social inheritance and individual variation in it. Our approach and results exemplify the potential of generative models to connect individual-level processes to emergent patterns and advance our understanding of social complexity in nature.

AB  - Restoration is frequently aimed at the recovery of target species, but also influences the larger food web in which these species participate. Effects of restoration on this broader network of organisms can influence target species both directly and indirectly via changes in energy flow through food webs. To help incorporate these complexities into river restoration planning, we constructed a model that links river food web dynamics to in-stream physical habitat and riparian vegetation conditions. We present an application of the model to the Methow River, Washington, USA, a location of on-going restoration aimed at recovering salmon. Three restoration strategies were simulated: riparian vegetation restoration, nutrient augmentation via salmon carcass addition, and side channel reconnection. We also added populations of nonnative aquatic snails and fish to the modeled food web to explore how changes in food web structure mediate responses to restoration. Simulations suggest that side channel reconnection may be a better strategy than carcass addition and vegetation planting for improving conditions for salmon in this river segment. However, modeled responses were strongly sensitive to changes in the structure of the food web. The addition of nonnative snails and fish modified pathways of energy through the food web, which negated restoration improvements. This finding illustrates that forecasting responses to restoration may require accounting for the structure of food webs, and that changes in this structure, as might be expected with the spread of invasive species, could compromise restoration outcomes. Unlike habitat-based approaches to restoration assessment that focus on the direct effects of physical habitat conditions on single species of interest, our approach dynamically links the success of target organisms to the success of competitors, predators, and prey. By elucidating the direct and indirect pathways by which restoration affects target species, dynamic food web models can improve restoration planning by fostering a deeper understanding of system connectedness and dynamics.

AB  - Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are commonly used to model animal movement data and infer aspects of animal behavior. An HMM assumes that each data point from a time series of observations stems from one of N possible states. The states are loosely connected to behavioral modes that manifest themselves at the temporal resolution at which observations are made. Due to advances in tag technology and tracking with digital video recordings, data can be collected at increasingly fine temporal resolutions. Yet, inferences at time scales cruder than those at which data are collected and, which correspond to larger-scale behavioral processes, are not yet answered via HMMs. We include additional hierarchical structures to the basic HMM framework, incorporating multiple Markov chains at various time scales. The hierarchically structured HMMs allow for behavioral inferences at multiple time scales and can also serve as a means to avoid coarsening data. Our proposed framework is one of the first that models animal behavior simultaneously at multiple time scales, opening new possibilities in the area of animal movement and behavior modeling. We illustrate the application of hierarchically structured HMMs in two real-data examples: (i) vertical movements of harbor porpoises observed in the field, and (ii) garter snake movement data collected as part of an experimental design. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear online. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A growing body of evidence showing that individuals of some social species live in non-kin groups suggests kin selection is not required in all species for sociality to evolve. Here, we investigate 2 populations of Octodon degus, a widespread South American rodent that has been shown to form kin and non-kin groups. We quantified genetic relatedness among individuals in 23 social groups across 2 populations as well as social network parameters (association, strength, and clustering coefficient) in order to determine if these aspects of sociality were driven by kinship. Additionally, we analyzed social network parameters relative to ecological conditions at burrow systems used by groups, to determine if ecological characteristics within each population could explain variation in sociality. We found that genetic relatedness among individuals within social groups was not significantly higher than genetic relatedness among randomly selected individuals in both populations, suggesting that non-kin structure of groups is common in degus. In both populations, we found significant relationships between the habitat characteristics of burrow systems and the social network characteristics of individuals inhabiting those burrow systems. Our results suggest that degu sociality is non-kin based and that degu social networks are influenced by local conditions. Es creciente la evidencia que apoya la ocurrencia de especies sociales donde los individuos no están emparentados genéticamente, lo que sugiere que la selección de parentesco no es indispensable para la evolución de la sociabilidad. En este estudio se examinaron dos poblaciones de Octodon degus, un roedor sudamericano donde los grupos sociales pueden o no incluir individuos cercanamente emparentados. Se cuantificó el parentesco genético entre individuos en 23 grupos sociales y en redes sociales de dos poblaciones para determinar si estos aspectos de la sociabilidad dependen del grado de parentesco. Además, se examinaron asociaciones entre los parámetros cuantificados de las redes sociales (asociación, fuerza, coeficiente de anidamiento) y las condiciones ecológicas a nivel de los sistemas de madriguera usados por cada grupo. El grado de parentesco genético dentro de los grupos no fue distinto del grado de parentesco entre individuos de la población tomados al azar, lo que apoya que una estructura de grupos no emparentada es la regla en Octodon degus. En ambas poblaciones se registró una asociación entre características ecológicas de los sistemas de madriguera y atributos de las redes sociales de los individuos que usan estas estructuras. Nuestros resultados indican que la sociabilidad en Octodon degus no está basada en relaciones de parentesco y que las redes sociales de estos animales dependen de las condiciones ecológicas.A growing body of evidence showing that individuals of some social species live in non-kin groups suggests kin selection is not required in all species for sociality to evolve.

AB  - Matrilineal kin groups are common in social mammals and often exhibit cooperative behaviors. Social interactions in such groups may have varying consequences on fitness depending on the number of kin present. We used social network analysis to study which factors (including individual spatial distribution, sex, age, and kinship) affected patterns of aggressive interactions in Columbian ground squirrels during the important breeding period of lactation. In addition, we studied how patterns of aggressive interactions affected female reproduction and fitness. Received aggressions lessened as ground squirrels aged, likely reflecting greater dominance in older individuals. Outwards aggression peaked at prime reproductive age, but decreased in older individuals. In females, outwards aggressiveness was positively related to energy allocated to reproduction and annual fitness, suggesting that highly aggressive females were either of high intrinsic quality or were able to defend high-quality territories. Finally, female-female aggression was primarily targeted toward non-kin individuals, revealing the advantage for breeding adult females of having close kin neighbors that were also breeding. Thus, breeding females that were close kin appeared to be "genial neighbors" that benefited from increased fitness, highlighting the role of kin selection in mitigating the costs (e.g., injuries, stress) of aggression.

AB  - 1. Earlier studies used static models to evaluate the responses of mutualistic networks to external perturbations. Two classes of dynamics can be distinguished in ecological networks; population dynamics, represented mainly by changes in species abundances, and topological dynamics, represented by changes in the architecture of the web. 2. In this study, we model the temporal evolution of three empirical plant-pollination networks incorporating both population and topological dynamics. We test the hypothesis that topological plasticity, realized through the ability of animals to rewire their connections after depletion of host abundances, enhances tolerance of mutualistic networks to species loss. We also compared the performance of various rewiring rules in affecting robustness. 3. The results show that topological plasticity markedly increased the robustness of mutualistic networks. Our analyses also revealed that network robustness reached maximum levels when animals with less host plant availability were more likely to rewire. Also, preferential attachment to richer host plants, that is, to plants exhibiting higher abundance and few exploiters, enhances robustness more than other rewiring alternatives. 4. Our results highlight the potential role of topological plasticity in the robustness of mutualistic networks to species extinctions and suggest some plausible mechanisms by which the decisions of foragers may shape the collective dynamics of plant-pollinator systems.

AB  - The use of social and contact networks to answer basic and applied questions about infectious disease transmission in wildlife and livestock is receiving increased attention. Through social network analysis, we understand that wild animal and livestock populations, including farmed fish and poultry, often have a heterogeneous contact structure owing to social structure or trade networks. Network modelling is a flexible tool used to capture the heterogeneous contacts of a population in order to test hypotheses about the mechanisms of disease transmission, simulate and predict disease spread, and test disease control strategies. This review highlights how to use animal contact data, including social networks, for network modelling, and emphasizes that researchers should have a pathogen of interest in mind before collecting or using contact data. This paper describes the rising popularity of network approaches for understanding transmission dynamics in wild animal and livestock populations; discusses the common mismatch between contact networks as measured in animal behaviour and relevant parasites to match those networks; and highlights knowledge gaps in how to collect and analyse contact data. Opportunities for the future include increased attention to experiments, pathogen genetic markers and novel computational tools. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Both wild and captive studies of grooming in non-human primates emphasize the adaptive role of this behavior. Indeed, social grooming is frequently characterized as “social glue” in the life of primates. Grooming behavior is studied to reveal dominance, kin relations, and social networks. Many captive primates, including apes, are observed to over-groom which may result in denuding of individuals. This study focused on a discrete pattern of grooming, specifically hair plucking—a rapid jerking away of the hand or mouth to remove the hair and hair follicle, often accompanied by inspection and consumption of the hair and follicle. This pattern has never been reported for wild bonobos ( Pan paniscus ) but is routinely observed in many individuals in captive colonies. Subjects were 17 bonobos (4 wild-born and 13 captive-born) housed at the Columbus Zoo. Data on grooming behavior were collected using all-occurrence sampling. Approximately 21% of self-directed and dyadic grooming bouts involved hair plucking. The four wild-born individuals were never observed to hair pluck. While plucking was not significantly different between males and females, subadult males plucked significantly more than adult males. Self-directed plucking appears to be influenced by dominance—the dominant male and female showed the highest percent of self-directed plucking behavior, 54% and 57%, respectively. This is the first study to document the significance of plucking in bonobo grooming behavior and contributes to discussions of visitors’ perception of ape well being. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

While modularity quantifies the degree to which individuals associate within versus between social communities and provides a useful measure of structure in the social network, it assumes that the network has been well sampled. However, animal social network data is typically subject to sampling errors. In particular, the associations among individuals are often not sampled equally, and animal social network studies are often based on a relatively small set of observations. Here, we extend an existing framework for bootstrapping network metrics to provide a method for assessing the robustness of community assignment in social networks using a metric we call community assortativity ( r com ). We use simulations to demonstrate that modularity can reliably detect the transition from random to structured associations in networks that differ in size and number of communities, while community assortativity accurately measures the level of confidence based on the detectability of associations. We then demonstrate the use of these metrics using three publicly available data sets of avian social networks. We suggest that by explicitly addressing the known limitations in sampling animal social network, this approach will facilitate more rigorous analyses of population-level structural patterns across social systems.

AB  - The complexity and connectedness of eco-social processes have major influence on the emergence and spread of infectious diseases amongst humans and animals. The disciplinary nature of most research activity has made it difficult to improve our understanding of interactions and feedback loops within the relevant systems. Influenced by the One Health approach, increasing efforts have recently been made to address this knowledge gap. Disease emergence and spread is strongly influenced by host density and contact structures, pathogen characteristics and pathogen population and molecular evolutionary dynamics in different host species, and host response to infection. All these mechanisms are strongly influenced by eco-social processes, such as globalization and urbanization, which lead to changes in global ecosystem dynamics, including patterns of mobility, human population density and contact structures, and food production and consumption. An improved understanding of epidemiological and eco-social processes, including their interdependence, will be essential to be able to manage diseases in these circumstances. The interfaces between wild animals, domestic animals and humans need to be examined to identify the main risk pathways and put in place appropriate mitigation. Some recent examples of emerging infectious disease are described to illustrate eco-social processes that are influencing disease emergence and spread. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There has been extensive game-theoretic modelling of conditions leading to equilibria of producer--scrounger dichotomies in groups. However there is a surprising paucity of experimental evidence in wild populations. Here, we examine producer--scrounger games in five subpopulations of birds feeding at a socially learnt foraging task. Over four weeks, a bimodal distribution of producers and scroungers emerged in all areas, with pronounced and con- sistent individual tactic specialization persisting over 3 years. Tactics were unrelated to exploratory personality, but correlated with latency to contact and learn the foraging task, with the late arrivers and slower learners more likely to adopt the scrounging role. Additionally, the social environment was also important: at the broad scale, larger subpopulations with a higher social density contained proportionally more scroungers, while within subpopulations scroungers tended to be central in the social network and be observed in larger foraging flocks. This study thus provides a rare example of a stable, dimorphic distribution of producer--scrounger tactics in a wild population. It further gives support across multiple scales for a major prediction of social foraging theory; that the frequency of scroungers increases with group size. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social assortativity, preferentially associating with certain individuals, is a widespread behaviour among a diverse range of taxa. Animals often choose to associate with other individuals based on characteristics such as sex, age, body size, rank and genetic relatedness. These preferences can scale up to shape the overall social structure of an animal group or population. We investigated possible factors that might shape the social network structure of common racoons, Procyon lotor, in a high-density urban population in Cook County, Illinois, U.S.A. Racoon associations were recorded using proximity detecting radiocollars that recorded when individuals came within 1–1.5m of each other. In addition, dyadic measures of home range overlap and genetic relatedness were calculated for all individuals included in our study. We used multiple regression quadratic assignment procedures to determine what factors influenced the structure of racoon association networks. The only variable that positively influenced racoon social structure was male–male homophily, which is consistent with previous studies that documented frequent social interactions between adult male racoons. Genetic relatedness had no effect on racoon social networks and there was no evidence that males or females preferentially associated with close relatives, despite the presence of kin in the population. This pattern, that kinship does not play a significant role in shaping social structure, is strikingly unusual among mammals and is not consistent with many socioecological models. Although racoon individuals showed strong social partner preferences, it is unclear what factors drove these choices. This unpredictability in partner choice shaped the structure of the racoon social networks and has important implications for disease transfer in this widespread animal vector.

T1  - Connectivity conservation priorities for individual patches evaluated in the present landscape: how durable and effective are they in the long term?

AB  - One of the most widespread approaches for setting spatially-explicit priorities for connectivity conservation consists in evaluating the effects of the individual removal of each habitat patch (one at a time) from the landscape. It however remains unknown the degree to which such priorities are valid and reliable in the longer term, as subsequent habitat losses and other disruptions accumulate in the landscape. We compared the patch prioritizations and estimated connectivity losses resulting from individual patch removals and from a more exhaustive assessment accounting for the potentially synergistic impacts of multiple habitat losses by testing all possible combinations of patch removals. Habitat availability (reachability) metrics and metapopulation capacity were calculated in purposefully simulated landscapes and in habitat distribution data for three bird species (NE Spain). We found that 1) individual patch removals allowed identifying areas of low contribution to connectivity that remained so after subsequent network modifications, 2) the most important patches identified through individual removals often did not coincide with those patches whose removal would actually be most detrimental after multiple habitat losses. However, these differences were smaller for the habitat reachability metrics, as well as for very mobile species that were largely insensitive to habitat spatial arrangement. If many patch losses over time are likely, it might be a more robust and fruitful conservation strategy for managers to pinpoint those patches that, with a low negative impact on connectivity, can be converted to other land uses, instead of trying to elucidate through individual patch removals which subset of protected patches would be the most effective for conserving as much connectivity as possible in the long term. Individual patch removals provide useful but non-permanent guidelines that may need to be reassessed when substantial landscape modifications occur, which requires dynamic strategies for connectivity conservation in the face of global change.

AB  - Modulation of neural activity by monoamine neurotransmitters is thought to play an essential role in shaping computational neurodynamics in the neocortex, especially in prefrontal regions. Computational theories propose that monoamines may exert bidirectional (concentration-dependent) effects on cognition by altering prefrontal cortical attractor dynamics according to an inverted U-shaped function. To date, this hypothesis has not been addressed directly, in part because of the absence of appropriate statistical methods required to assess attractor-like behavior in vivo. The present study used a combination of advanced multivariate statistical, time series analysis, and machine learning methods to assess dynamic changes in network activity from multiple single-unit recordings from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats while the animals performed a foraging task guided by working memory after pretreatment with different doses of D-amphetamine (AMPH), which increases monoamine efflux in the mPFC. A dose-dependent, bidirectional effect of AMPH on neural dynamics in the mPFC was observed. Specifically, a 1.0 mg/kg dose of AMPH accentuated separation between task-epoch-specific population states and convergence toward these states. In contrast, a 3.3 mg/kg dose diminished separation and convergence toward task-epoch-specific population states, which was paralleled by deficits in cognitive performance. These results support the computationally derived hypothesis that moderate increases in monoamine efflux would enhance attractor stability, whereas high frontal monoamine levels would severely diminish it. Furthermore, they are consistent with the proposed inverted U-shaped and concentration-dependent modulation of cortical efficiency by monoamines. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Male–male interactions in mixed‐sex groups of social mammals are typically characterized by a mix of hostility and affiliation, as a result of inherent conflicts over mating opportunities, and the costs and benefits of social alliances, co‐operative behaviors, and coalitionary defense. In species of nonhuman primates that form all‐male groups, it is still unclear how the tradeoffs between the benefits of forming an all‐male group and the cost of male–male competition in seeking mating opportunities with females in bisexual groups influence social cohesion in different seasons. Here, we used social network analysis to quantify the impact of reproductive seasonality on social cohesion and clique size of bachelor males residing in an all‐male unit (AMU) in wild black‐and‐white snub‐nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti). These primates are strict seasonal breeders and live in a modular social system composed of a number of one‐male units (OMUs) and an associated peripheral AMU. We found that the AMU social network had a significantly lower density, centralization, clustering coefficient, and smaller clique size during the mating season compared to the non‐mating period. However, aggression among AMU males during both mating and non‐mating periods was low. Our results suggest that network structure topology in male same‐sex social units is modulated by seasonal changes. Bachelor males engage in two types of competition to gain reproductive success: first, which is analogous to contest competition, in which bachelor males act aggressively and challenge OMU leader males in an attempt to take over an OMU; and second, which is more analogous to scramble competition, in which bachelor males avoid aggressive interactions and instead engage in sneaky copulations with fertile females. Our work adds to an understanding of the maintenance of all‐male groups in species that form a multilevel society. This paper: 1) found bachelor males maintain affiliation throughout the year; 2) found a less cohesive network of an all‐male unit during the mating season than non‐mating periods; 3) suggests scramble competition characterizes bachelor males.

AB  - • The transcriptional levels of components associated with the ECM were modulated during embryonic development. • Col4α1 , Itgβ, Mmp1 and Timp were overexpressed after UVB exposure. • UVB disrupted the normal expression of components associated with the ECM. • Col4α1, Itgβ, Lamα, Mmp1 and Timp gene sequences of M. olfersii were similar to other Decapoda species. • The Itgβ and Mmp1 transcript levels were the more reliable biomarkers for the assessment of the UVB exposure. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a non-cellular and three-dimensional structure, constituted by a macromolecular dynamic network that involves the cells in all animal tissues, including embryonic ones. Several studies with vertebrates and cell cultures have reported deleterious effects of ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation on the components associated with the ECM. However, studies focusing on the UVB radiation effects on ECM components of crustaceans during embryonic development are very scarce. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the coding sequences of components associated with the ECM and to evaluate the effect of UVB radiation on embryos of the ecologically-important decapod Macrobrachium olfersii. To evaluate the modulation of these ECM components during embryonic development, the transcript levels of Col4α1 , Itgβ , Lamα , Mmp1 and Timp in M. olfersii embryos were analyzed at early developmental stages (E1, E3 and E4), intermediate developmental stage (E7) and late developmental stages (E10 and E14). In addition, embryos at E7, which correspond to a landmark of crustacean development, were analyzed after 12 h of UVB exposure to verify UVB effects on the ECM components. The ECM component sequences were similar to other decapods, suggesting conservation of these genes among crustaceans. The results showed modulations of the ECM components of M. olfersii embryos that reflect the need for each component in the cellular mechanisms, necessary for normal embryonic development. After UVB exposure, embryos showed opacity of embryonic tissues and it was found the overexpression of Col4α1 , Itgβ, Mmp1 and Timp transcript levels (1.82-, 1.52-, 2.34- and 6.27-fold, respectively). These impairments can compromise important events for normal embryonic development, such as growth of optic lobes, caudal papilla, ramification of appendages and differentiation of organic systems. The results presented here, together with the effects on morphology, cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis demonstrated previously, strengthen the knowledge of the complex impacts of UVB radiation on freshwater embryos. Nevertheless, our results encourage further investigations focusing on the assessment of UVB effects on different organisms in order to better understand the myriad of UVB effects on ECM components.

AB  - Pairwise measures of neutral genetic differentiation are supposed to contain information about past and ongoing dispersal events and are thus often used as dependent variables in correlative analyses to elucidate how neutral genetic variation is affected by landscape connectivity. However, spatial heterogeneity in the intensity of genetic drift, stemming from variations in population sizes, may inflate variance in measures of genetic differentiation and lead to erroneous or incomplete interpretations in terms of connectivity. Here, we tested the efficiency of two distance-based metrics designed to capture the unique influence of spatial heterogeneity in local drift on genetic differentiation. These metrics are easily computed from estimates of effective population sizes or from environmental proxies for local carrying capacities, and allow us to introduce the hypothesis of Spatial-Heterogeneity-in-Effective-Population-Sizes ( SHNe). SHNe can be tested in a way similar to isolation-by-distance or isolation-by-resistance within the classical landscape genetics hypothesis-testing framework., We used simulations under various models of population structure to investigate the reliability of these metrics to quantify the unique contribution of SHNe in explaining patterns of genetic differentiation. We then applied these metrics to an empirical genetic dataset obtained for a freshwater fish ( Gobio occitaniae)., Simulations showed that SHNe explained up to 60% of variance in genetic differentiation (measured as F<sub>st</sub>) in the absence of gene flow, and up to 20% when migration rates were as high as 0.10. Furthermore, one of the two metrics was particularly robust to uncertainty in the estimation of effective population sizes (or proxies for carrying capacity). In the empirical dataset, the effect of SHNe on spatial patterns of F<sub>st</sub> was five times higher than that of isolation-by-distance, uniquely contributing to 41% of variance in pairwise F<sub>st</sub>. Taking the influence of SHNe into account also allowed decreasing the signal-to-noise ratio, and improving the upper estimate of effective dispersal distance., We conclude that the use of SHNe metrics in landscape genetics will substantially improve the understanding of evolutionary drivers of genetic variation, providing substantial information as to the actual drivers of patterns of genetic differentiation in addition to traditional measures of Euclidean distance or landscape resistance.

AB  - The wildlife trade is a lucrative industry involving thousands of animal and plant species. The increasing use of the internet for both legal and illegal wildlife trade is well documented, but there is evidence that trade may be emerging on new online technologies such as social media. Using the orchid trade as a case study, we conducted the first systematic survey of wildlife trade on an international social-media website. We focused on themed forums (groups), where people with similar interests can interact by uploading images or text (posts) that are visible to other group members. We used social-network analysis to examine the ties between 150 of these orchid-themed groups to determine the structure of the network. We found 4 communities of closely linked groups based around shared language. Most trade occurred in a community that consisted of English-speaking and Southeast Asian groups. In addition to the network analysis, we randomly sampled 30 groups from the whole network to assess the prevalence of trade in cultivated and wild plants. Of 55,805 posts recorded over 12 weeks, 8.9% contained plants for sale, and 22-46% of these posts pertained to wild-collected orchids. Although total numbers of posts about trade were relatively small, the large proportion of posts advertising wild orchids for sale supports calls for better monitoring of social media for trade in wild-collected plants.

AB  - Habitat connectivity is important for species’ survival and can be maintained in landscapes with well-connected habitat networks. The integrity of these habitat networks, however, is often threatened by “human networks” consisting of settlements connected by roads with traffic. Both settlement and road network changes can decrease habitat connectivity, either directly or indirectly through changes in traffic flows. Due to these complex interactions, it remains unclear how habitat connectivity in habitat networks is affected by settlement or road network configurations in human networks. To address this issue we develop a new spatially explicit simulation model coupling habitat and human networks. In binary landscape rasters, consisting of settlement patches surrounded by a continuous matrix through which animals could move, we varied the number, the size and the proportion of settlements. Settlements were connected with either dense or sparse road networks. On all roads connecting settlements, we estimated traffic volume based on settlement sizes and topology. Traffic volumes were then used to parameterize landscape resistance networks that quantify the probability of movement for animals throughout the landscape. From these resistance networks, we calculated average habitat connectivity for several animal species (i.e. tree frog, hedgehog and badger). In this innovative model setup, habitat connectivity was thus influenced by a combination of settlement patterns and traffic volumes. For all species, we found a negative correlation between habitat connectivity and the number of settlement patches. Furthermore, in landscapes with a high proportion of settlement, highest habitat connectivity was found when most settlement cells were concentrated in large patches. Surprisingly, in some cases, we found higher habitat connectivity for dense road networks than for sparse road networks. Results from this study can increase our understanding of habitat connectivity in heterogeneous landscapes and lead to recommendations for conservation planning. With this study we demonstrate the importance of considering interactions between spatial networks in ecological analyses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Adaptive trade-offs between foraging and social behavior intuitively explain many aspects of individual decision-making. Given the intimate connection between social behavior and feeding/foraging at the behavioral level, we propose that social behaviors are linked to foraging on a mechanistic level, and that modifications of feeding circuits are crucial in the evolution of complex social behaviors. In this Review, we first highlight the overlap between mechanisms underlying foraging and parental care and then expand this argument to consider the manipulation of feeding-related pathways in the evolution of other complex social behaviors. We include examples from diverse taxa to highlight that the independent evolution of complex social behaviors is a variation on the theme of feeding circuit modification. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Nature conservation policies need to deliver on multiple criteria, including genetic diversity, population viability and species richness as well as ecosystem services. The challenge of integrating these may be addressed by simulation modelling., We used four models (MetaConnect, SPOMSIM, a community model and In VEST) to assess a variety of spatial habitat patterns with two levels of total habitat cover and realised at two spatial scales, exploring which landscape structures performed best according to five different conservation criteria assessed for four functional types of organisms (approximately representing trees, butterflies, small mammals and birds)., The results display both synergies and trade-offs: population size and pollination services generally benefitted more from fragmentation than did genetic heterozygosity, and species richness more than allelic richness, although the latter two varied considerably among the functional types., No single landscape performed best across all conservation criteria, but averaging over criteria and functional types, overall performance improved with greater levels of habitat cover and intermediate fragmentation (or less fragmentation in cases with lower habitat cover)., Policy implications. Using four simulation models, we show that different conservation objectives must be traded off in spatial conservation planning, and that considering only a single taxon or criterion may result in suboptimal choices when planning reserve networks. Nevertheless, heterogeneous spatial patterns of habitat can provide reasonable compromises for multiple criteria. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Animal personalities can influence social interactions among individuals, and thus have major implications for population processes and structure. Few studies have investigated the significance of the social context of animal personalities, and such research has largely focused on the social organization of nonterritorial populations. Here we address the question of whether exploratory behaviour, a well-studied personality trait, is related to the social structure of a wild great tit, Parus major , population during the breeding season. We assayed the exploration behaviour of wild-caught great tits and then established the phenotypic spatial structure of the population over six consecutive breeding seasons. Network analyses of breeding proximity revealed that males, but not females, show positive assortment by behavioural phenotype, with males breeding closer to those of similar personalities. This assortment was detected when we used networks based on nearest neighbours, but not when we used the Thiessen polygon method where neighbours were defined from inferred territory boundaries. Further analysis found no relationship between personality assortment and local environmental conditions, suggesting that social processes may be more important than environmental variation in influencing male territory choice. This social organization during the breeding season has implications for the strength and direction of both natural and sexual selection on personality in wild animal populations.

AB  - East Africa's Lake Victoria provides resources and services to millions of people on the lake's shores and abroad. In particular, the lake's fisheries are an important source of protein, employment, and international economic connections for the whole region. Nonetheless, stock dynamics are poorly understood and currently unpredictable. Furthermore, fishery dynamics are intricately connected to other supporting services of the lake as well as to lakeshore societies and economies. Much research has been carried out piecemeal on different aspects of Lake Victoria's system; e.g., societies, biodiversity, fisheries, and eutrophication. However, to disentangle drivers and dynamics of change in this complex system, we need to put these pieces together and analyze the system as a whole. We did so by first building a qualitative model of the lake's social-ecological system. We then investigated the model system through a qualitative loop analysis, and finally examined effects of changes on the system state and structure. The model and its contextual analysis allowed us to investigate system-wide chain reactions resulting from disturbances. Importantly, we built a tool that can be used to analyze the cascading effects of management options and establish the requirements for their success. We found that high connectedness of the system at the exploitation level, through fisheries having multiple target stocks, can increase the stocks' vulnerability to exploitation but reduce society's vulnerability to variability in individual stocks. We describe how there are multiple pathways to any change in the system, which makes it difficult to identify the root cause of changes but also broadens the management toolkit. Also, we illustrate how nutrient enrichment is not a self-regulating process, and that explicit management is necessary to halt or reverse eutrophication. This model is simple and usable to assess system-wide effects of management policies, and can serve as a paving stone for future quantitative analyses of system dynamics at local scales.

AB  - We quantified piscivory patterns in the main basin of Lake Huron during 1984-2010 and found that the biomass transfer from prey fish to piscivores remained consistently high despite the rapid major trophic shift in the food webs. We coupled age-structured stock assessment models and fish bioenergetics models for lake trout ( Salvelinus namaycush), Chinook salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), walleye ( Sander vitreus), and lake whitefish ( Coregonus clupeaformis). The model system also included time-varying parameters or variables of growth, length-mass relations, maturity schedules, energy density, and diets. These time-varying models reflected the dynamic connections that a fish cohort responded to year-to-year ecosystem changes at different ages and body sizes. We found that the ratio of annual predation by lake trout, Chinook salmon, and walleye combined with the biomass indices of age-1 and older alewives ( Alosa pseudoharengus) and rainbow smelt ( Osmerus mordax) increased more than tenfold during 1987-2010, and such increases in predation pressure were structured by relatively stable biomass of the three piscivores and stepwise declines in the biomass of alewives and rainbow smelt. The piscivore stability was supported by the use of alternative energy pathways and changes in relative composition of the three piscivores. In addition, lake whitefish became a new piscivore by feeding on round goby ( Neogobius melanostomus). Their total fish consumption rivaled that of the other piscivores combined, although fish were still a modest proportion of their diet. Overall, the use of alternative energy pathways by piscivores allowed the increases in predation pressure on dominant diet species. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Many actions performed by animals and humans depend on an ability to learn, estimate, and produce temporal intervals of behavioral relevance. Exemplifying such learning of cued expectancies is the observation of reward-timing activity in the primary visual cortex (V1) of rodents, wherein neural responses to visual cues come to predict the time of future reward as behaviorally experienced in the past. These reward-timing responses exhibit significant heterogeneity in at least three qualitatively distinct classes: sustained increase or sustained decrease in firing rate until the time of expected reward, and a class of cells that reach a peak in firing at the expected delay. We elaborate upon our existing model by including inhibitory and excitatory units while imposing simple connectivity rules to demonstrate what role these inhibitory elements and the simple architectures play in sculpting the response dynamics of the network. We find that simply adding inhibition is not sufficient for obtaining the different distinct response classes, and that a broad distribution of inhibitory projections is necessary for obtaining peak-type responses. Furthermore, although changes in connection strength that modulate the effects of inhibition onto excitatory units have a strong impact on the firing rate profile of these peaked responses, the network exhibits robustness in its overall ability to predict the expected time of reward. Finally, we demonstrate how the magnitude of expected reward can be encoded at the expected delay in the network and how peaked responses express this reward expectancy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals can negatively impact the morphology and behavior of organisms inhabiting polluted waters. Male-typical behaviors are often reduced after exposure, suggesting that exposure may have population-level effects. One way in which exposure may exert population-level effects is by interfering with communication within a network of individuals. Acute exposure to the estrogen mimic 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) disrupts the ability of male Siamese fighting fish, Betta splendens , to modify their behavior during male–male interactions when an audience is present. However, it is unknown whether audience effects during male–female interactions may be similarly altered. To examine this, male–female pairs that were given an acute exposure to EE2 or remained unexposed interacted in the presence of a female, male, or no audience. Sex differences were found between unexposed males and females. More interactant-directed gill flaring was displayed by control males when a male audience was present while control females performed this behavior more in the presence of an audience, regardless of sex. Both males and females in the control group performed more interactant-directed tail beats in the presence of a female audience. EE2 exposure made all audience effects disappear as treated males and females did not differ in their responses between audience types. These results demonstrate that acute exposure to EE2 may disrupt behavioral adjustments to audience type within a social network. This disruption may, in turn, influence population dynamics in this species as both males and females use information obtained from observing interactions in later encounters with the observed individuals.

AB  - Aim Spatial dynamics and habitat connectivity affect community composition and diversity in many ecosystems. For many decades, diversity patterns in riverine ecosystems were thought to be related to local environmental conditions. Recent theoretical work, however, suggests that diversity in rivers is strongly affected by dispersal along the dendritic landscape structure and that environmental conditions are intrinsically linked to the network position. In this study we tested hypotheses on network position by relating river network geometry and connectivity to multi-level biodiversity patterns across large scales. Location Three major alpine drainage basins in Switzerland were studied (Rhine, Rhone, Ticino), extending over an elevational gradient of > 2500 m and covering a total area of 41,285 km<sup>2</sup>. Methods We sampled all may-, stone- and caddisfly species at 217 sites which representatively cover the three river networks. Using generalized additive models, we related diversity patterns in aquatic insects to centrality within the network as a direct river network property, and to catchment area and elevation, which are related to network position. Results Centrality within the river network, and catchment area and elevation had significant and interacting effects on α-diversity and community similarity. Alpha diversity was lowest in peripheral headwaters and at high elevations. Species richness generally increased with increasing catchment area. Well-connected, central communities within the river network had greater α-diversity than more peripheral communities did. Elevation was a strong predictor of α-diversity, with the most diverse communities found at mid-elevation sites. Community similarity decreased with increasing along-stream distance between sites. Main conclusions Our results highlight the fact that diversity patterns of aquatic insects in river systems are related to local factors such as elevation, but interact with network properties and connectivity along waterways, and differ among insect orders. These findings are consistent with dispersal-limited processes and indicate that riverine diversity should be addressed and protected taking the river network structure into account.

AB  - Friendship pervades the human social landscape. These bonds are so important that disrupting them leads to health problems, and difficulties forming or maintaining friendships attend neuropsychiatric disorders like autism and depression. Other animals also have friends, suggesting that friendship is not solely a human invention but is instead an evolved trait. A neuroethological approach applies behavioral, neurobiological, and molecular techniques to explain friendship with reference to its underlying mechanisms, development, evolutionary origins, and biological function. Recent studies implicate a shared suite of neural circuits and neuromodulatory pathways in the formation, maintenance, and manipulation of friendships across humans and other animals. Health consequences and reproductive advantages in mammals additionally suggest that friendship has adaptive benefits. We argue that understanding the neuroethology of friendship in humans and other animals brings us closer to knowing fully what it means to be human. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Grouping is a very common outcome of selection that operates on individual animals. Largely considered to be driven by immediate benefits, such as avoiding predators, animal groups often consist of individuals that are phenotypically more similar than expected from the population distribution. This suggests that the distribution and fitness of phenotypes may be shaped by multiple levels of selection operating along different axes of behaviour. Thus, quantifying assortative mixing, or the measure of association between similar individuals in social networks, should be a key component of the biologist's toolbox. Yet, assortment is rarely tested in animal social networks. This may be driven by a lack of tools for robust estimation of assortment, given the reliance of current methods on binary networks. In this paper, I extend existing approaches that calculate the assortativity coefficient of both nominal classes and continuous traits to incorporate weighted associations. I have made these available through a new R package ‘assortnet’. I use simulated networks to show that weighted assortment coefficients are more robust than those calculated on binary networks to added noise that could arise from random interactions or sampling errors. Finally, I demonstrate how these methods differ by applying them to two existing social networks estimated from wild populations, exploring assortment by species, sex and network degree. Given the parallel theoretical developments of the importance of local social structure on population processes, and increasing data on social networks being collected in free-living populations, understanding phenotypic assortment could yield significant insight into social evolution.

AB  - This paper arises from a four-year Indonesian-German research cooperation on the governance and management of Indonesian coastal and marine ecosystems. Project objectives were to investigate coastal and marine social-ecological dynamics and feedbacks and to analyse socio-political and institutional structures and processes in order to support adaptive coastal governance. Participating researchers worked in the Spermonde Archipelago, off South Sulawesi, Indonesia, between 2007 and 2010. Methods included ship-based research excursions, several classical surveys, anthropological participant observation, and participatory research methods applied by an interdisciplinary social-natural science team. This paper summarises our findings and draws policy conclusions. First, we discuss Marine Protected Areas and participation focussing on local “rules-in-use”. In addition, reef exploitation and local livelihoods, in particular fisheries and mariculture, and the existing social networks and hierarchies in fisheries are explored to understand social vulnerability, resilience and marine resource governance in the context of the Spermonde Archipelago. An outline of major policy recommendations concludes this article. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine, within the aquatic environment may adversely affect the health and behavior of exposed organisms. Most studies on the effects of inadvertent pharmaceutical exposure focus on the individual level rather than examining behavior within a network of individuals. Within communication networks, interactants send signals to multiple individuals, potentially altering, and being altered by, the behavior of nearby individuals. To address if fluoxetine interferes with communication within a network, male Siamese fighting fish interacted under three audience types (male, female, or no audience) and two exposure conditions (control, fluoxetine). In the control group, findings were similar to prior studies, with males altering gill flaring rate depending on the sex of the audience present. In the exposed group, gill flaring did not differ based on audience type and was lower overall compared to the control, suggesting a reduction in aggression. In contrast, both unexposed and exposed males performed more tail beats when a female audience was present, suggesting that fluoxetine has a context-specific effect on behavior. Behavioral changes during current interactions may affect behavior during later interactions as well as the outcome of future encounters with audience individuals. The influence of fluoxetine on total behavior within an interaction and loss of audience effect suggests it may generate broader changes in communication beyond the exposed individual, causing fitness consequences. This study stresses the importance of studying the effects of inadvertent pharmaceutical exposure on behavior in multiple social contexts to better understand its impacts on complex communication systems.

AB  - In many social species, there are important connections between social behaviour and reproduction that provide critical insights into the evolution of sociality. In this study, we describe associations between agonistic behaviour and male reproductive success in stable social groups of bluebanded gobies (Lythrypnus dalli). This highly social, sex-changing species forms linear hierarchies of a dominant male and multiple subordinate females. Males reproduce with each female in the harem and care for the eggs. Since aggression tends to be associated with reduced reproduction in social hierarchies, we hypothesized that males in groups with high rates of aggression would fertilise fewer eggs. We also hypothesized that a male's agonistic behaviour would be associated with his reproductive success. Dominants often exert substantial control over their harem, including control over subordinate reproduction. To address these hypotheses, we quantified egg laying/fertilisation over 13 days and observed agonistic behaviour. We show that there was a significant, negative association between male reproductive success and the total rate agonistic interactions by a group. While no male behaviours were associated with the quantity of eggs fertilised, female agonistic behaviour may be central to male reproductive success. We identified a set of models approximating male reproductive success that included three female behaviours: aggression by the highest-ranking female and approaches by the lowest-ranking female were negatively associated with the quantity of eggs fertilised by males in their groups, but the efficiency with which the middle-ranking female displaced others was positively associated with this measure. These data provide a first step in elucidating the behavioural mechanisms that are associated with L. dalli reproductive success. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Network null models are important to drawing conclusions about individual- and population-(or graph) level metrics. While the null models of binary networks are well studied, recent literature on weighted networks suggests that: (1) many so-called ‘weighted metrics’ do not actually depend on weights, and (2) many metrics that supposedly measure higher-order social structure actually are highly correlated with individual-level attributes. This is important for behavioural ecology studies where weighted network analyses predominate, but there is no consensus on how null models should be specified. Using real social networks, we developed three null models that address two technical challenges in the networks of social animals: (1) how to specify null models that are suitable for ‘proportion-weighted networks’ based on indices such as the half-weight index; and (2) how to condition on the degree- and strength-sequence and both. We compared 11 metrics with each other and against null-model expectations for 10 social networks of bottlenose dolphin, Tursiops aduncus , from Shark Bay, Australia. Observed metric values were similar to null-model expectations for some weighted metrics, such as centrality measures, disparity and connectivity, whereas other metrics such as affinity and clustering were informative about dolphin social structure. Because weighted metrics can differ in their sensitivity to the degree-sequence or strength-sequence, conditioning on both is a more reliable and conservative null model than the more common strength-preserving null-model for weighted networks. Other social structure analyses, such as community partitioning by weighted Modularity optimization, were much less sensitive to the underlying null-model. Lastly, in contrast to results in other scientific disciplines, we found that many weighted metrics do not depend trivially on topology; rather, the weight distribution contains important information about dolphin social structure.

AB  - Aim To investigate the association between hummingbird-plant network structure and species richness, phylogenetic signal on species' interaction pattern, insularity and historical and current climate. Location Fifty-four communities along a c. 10,000 km latitudinal gradient across the Americas (39°  N-32°  S), ranging from sea level to c. 3700 m a.s.l., located on the mainland and on islands and covering a wide range of climate regimes. Methods We measured the level of specialization and modularity in mutualistic plant-hummingbird interaction networks. Using an ordinary least squares multimodel approach, we examined the influence of species richness, phylogenetic signal, insularity and current and historical climate conditions on network structure (null-model-corrected specialization and modularity). Results Phylogenetically related species, especially plants, showed a tendency to interact with a similar array of mutualistic partners. The spatial variation in network structure exhibited a constant association with species phylogeny ( R<sup>2</sup> = 0.18-0.19); however, network structure showed the strongest association with species richness and environmental factors ( R<sup>2</sup> = 0.20-0.44 and R<sup>2</sup> = 0.32-0.45, respectively). Specifically, higher levels of specialization and modularity were associated with species-rich communities and communities in which closely related hummingbirds visited distinct sets of flowering species. On the mainland, specialization was also associated with warmer temperatures and greater historical temperature stability. Main conclusions Our results confirm the results of previous macroecological studies of interaction networks which have highlighted the importance of species richness and the environment in determining network structure. Additionally, for the first time, we report an association between network structure and species phylogenetic signal at a macroecological scale, indicating that high specialization and modularity are associated with high interspecific competition among closely related hummingbirds, subdividing the floral niche. This suggests a tighter co-evolutionary association between hummingbirds and their plants than in previously studied plant-bird mutualistic systems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social insects rely extensively on interactions to coordinate their activities. Some studies have recently explored several attributes of insect colonies from a network perspective, providing evidence of variation in connectivity patterns among group members. The temporal stability of interaction networks, however, has rarely been examined. In this study, ants of the species Odontomachus hastatus were individually equipped with passive microtransponders to collect their spatial positions in artificial nests automatically. Colonies were surveyed for 3 consecutive weeks to build weighted networks of proximity between ants. The analysis revealed important interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and showed that proximity networks were stable over time. The removal of the queen did not impact the patterns of association between workers, confirming that she did not contribute to shaping network structure. Ants forming long-lasting associations with a small number of nestmates exhibited a reduced tendency to move. In contrast, mobile workers were more likely to interact homogeneously with their nestmates and did not display any privileged associations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - ABSTRACT What if there was a way to solve one of the most complex and important scale challenges that ecologists face: the selection of the appropriate sampling scale resolution and extent when conducting studies. To date, the investigator conducting any study has been tasked with this challenge. Qualitatively different patterns arise as the scale resolution or extent of the observation is changed. Likewise, different patterns arise as the scales of the sampling are changed. Too often, data at one resolution are aggregated or interpretations of patterns at smaller scale resolutions and extents are extrapolated to larger extents. When this is done, either modifiable areal unit problems or extrapolation errors arise. I argue that consilient developments in movement ecology, graph (network) theory and analyses, and important technical advances in biologging can be linked synergistically to directly address the sampling scale problem, particularly in studies where understanding animal response to changing landscapes is the goal. The essence of the solution is that rather than having to decide the spatial extent and resolution to use, the issue is avoided by allowing the telemetered animal to show the relevant scales it uses as it moves during its daily, seasonal, and annual activities. The consilient result is that big data at the appropriate scales can be extracted rather than aggregated as is now the rule. Without data aggregation, no modifiable areal unit problems are involved because the dynamics are network based. Additionally, use of first passage time methodology and measurement of area-restricted movements allow assessments of the scales of activity and the effects of environmental covariates on animal movement. I begin with a brief history of the concept of scale, describing what is considered to be the essence of the problem. I follow with a brief explanation of the developments in movement ecology, graph theory and analysis, and the technical advancements in biologging with examples from studies of wildlife species that are using these new developments. I then describe how their consilient integration can provide a different way of thinking about scale resolution and extent in ecology and suggest how ecologists can avoid the observer sampling scale complication by making a critical scale distinction and by using first passage time analyses. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.

AB  - Along with social grooming and food sharing, social play is considered to be an affiliative interaction among wild chimpanzees. However, infant, juvenile, and adolescent animals engage in social play more frequently than adult animals, while other affiliative interactions occur more commonly between adults. We studied the social play of well-habituated and individually identified wild chimpanzees of the M group in Mahale Mountains National Park, Tanzania over two research periods in 2010 and 2011 (21 and 17 observation days, respectively). In both periods, most members of the M group, including adolescents and adults, took part in social play at least once. The degree centralities of the play network in infants, juveniles, and adolescents were significantly higher than those seen in adults. There was a significant and positive correlation between the total number of participations in social play and the degree centrality of play networks. Partial play networks and partial association networks consisting of individuals in same-age categories were significantly and positively correlated in infants and juveniles, although they were not correlated in adolescents or adults. These results suggest that infants, juveniles and adolescents who played frequently were more central in the group, whilst the adults who played infrequently were more peripheral. In addition, the overall structure of the social play network was stable over time. The frequency of participation in social play positively contributed to the development of affiliative social relationships within the chimpanzee group during the infant or juvenile period, but did not have the same effect during the adolescent and adult period. The social play network may allow individuals to develop the social techniques necessary to acquire a central position in a society and enable them to develop affiliative relationships during the infant or juvenile period.

AB  - Studies of spatial proximity between individuals are important for an understanding of social structure because animals are more likely to interact with individuals in close spatial proximity. Here, we apply social network analysis to proximity data collected between 2001 and 2003 from an individually identified, provisioned, free-ranging band of Sichuan snub-nosed monkeys ( Rhinopithecus roxellana) in the Qinling Mountains, central China. We aimed to quantify the social network structure and to gain insight into each individual's position within the social network. The overall network connectivity of the study band was sparse, with a low group density of 0.17. We identified nine one-male-multifemale units (OMUs) in the study band using hierarchical cluster analysis, which confirms that this species forms a multilevel society in its natural habitat. Based on sex differences in eigenvector and betweenness centralities, adult females have more important social roles than males. Among females, lactating females scored higher betweenness and eigenvector centralities than other females. However, our results do not suggest the existence of key individual(s) in the social network of the study band. The global clustering coefficient characteristic of the band was 0.3 ± 0.1, with little variation between individuals, suggesting that the removal or death of any specific individual would not significantly disrupt its general network structure. Our results also show that proximity commonly occurs among unit members, but can also occur between females of different OMUs. These observations suggest that snub-nosed monkeys have a loose-knit or fluid rather than a rigid female-bonded social system, which may be a common trend for species living in multilevel societies.

AB  - Urban areas are expanding worldwide, yet little is known how anthropogenic landscape fragmentation affects the connectedness and gene flow in urban wildlife. The European hedgehog ( Erinaceus europaeus ) is a ground dwelling mammal which also inhabits variable urban habitats. We investigated habitat connectivity and the spatial genetic structure of urban hedgehogs in the largest Swiss city. We addressed the following questions: i) At the city-scale, which prominent landscape elements affect the spatial distribution of genetic clusters? ii) Which landscape elements affect gene flow in an urban mammal within the clusters? iii) Does individual movement data improve the prediction of landscape-wide gene flow? We used two Bayesian methods to examine the influence of water bodies and major traffic routes on genetic hedgehog clusters, using microsatellite data of 147 hedgehogs. Further, we used extensive movement data to parameterise single-path and multi-path connectivity models, which were then used to predict genetic distance between hedgehog individuals. First, we found that both Bayesian methods consistently showed three distinct genetic clusters, separated by the main rivers and the parallel running transportation axes. Second, the best model indicates that gene flow was facilitated by urban green areas and hampered by all other land cover types. Third, multi-path models based on detailed GPS movement data clearly outperformed models based on a priori assumptions to predict gene flow. Multi-path connectivity models based on movement data reveal to be a powerful tool to detect gene flow in highly fragmented habitats and could be a crucial step in implementing effective conservation measures.

AB  - Bonefishes (Genus Albula) across the global tropics support premier destination catch and release fisheries. In parts of the Indo-Pacific harvest also occurs, often unregulated. Vital information on species ranges and stock structure is lacking for the Indo-Pacific bonefishes. Population declines, data deficiencies, and the absence of management plans result in conservation concerns. Research on bonefishes has also been hindered by taxonomic uncertainty stemming from morphological cryptics and inconsistent nomenclature. Genetic identification is necessary for some bonefishes, due to highly conserved morphology. This study explores verified species occurrences and genetic connectivity for six Indo-Pacific bonefishes. Samples were obtained from 210 bonefish from 16 locations across the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Genetic identification was determined through cytochrome b sequence analyses and population structure assessed with 17 microsatellite loci. Two bonefishes ( A. glossodonta and A. oligolepis) are partially sympatric, suggesting multiple species may be supporting the fishery. Additional data are required to fully elucidate fishery composition at local scales and the geographic extent of species ranges. The IUCN Red List vulnerable A. glossodonta may experience increased fishing pressure due to its extensive Indo-Pacific range. Stock structure data support intraspecific genetic connectivity across broad spatial scales. Results suggested weak, non-geographic, genetic population structure in A. glossodonta, and panmixia in A. oligolepis and A. gilberti. The present study highlights the need for further research, and suggests conservation and management strategies for the Indo-Pac bonefishes may need both local and regional components to prevent further declines and localized collapse.

AB  - Social network analysis offers new tools to study the social structure of primate groups. We used social network analysis to investigate the cohesiveness of a grooming network in a captive chimpanzee group ( N = 17) and the role that individuals may play in it. Using data from a year-long observation, we constructed an unweighted social network of preferred grooming interactions by retaining only those dyads that groomed above the group mean. This choice of criterion was validated by the finding that the properties of the unweighted network correlated with the properties of a weighted network (i.e. a network representing the frequency of grooming interactions) constructed from the same data. To investigate group cohesion, we tested the resilience of the unweighted grooming network to the removal of central individuals (i.e. individuals with high betweenness centrality). The network fragmented more after the removal of individuals with high betweenness centrality than after the removal of random individuals. Central individuals played a pivotal role in maintaining the network's cohesiveness, and we suggest that this may be a typical property of affiliative networks like grooming networks. We found that the grooming network correlated with kinship and age, and that individuals with higher social status occupied more central positions in the network. Overall, the grooming network showed a heterogeneous structure, yet did not exhibit scale-free properties similar to many other primate networks. We discuss our results in light of recent findings on animal social networks and chimpanzee grooming. Am. J. Primatol. 73:758-767, 2011. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Nonrandom mating can structure populations and has important implications for population-level processes. Investigating how and why mating deviates from random is important for understanding evolutionary processes as well as informing conservation and management. Prior to the implementation of parentage analyses, understanding mating patterns in solitary, elusive species like bears was virtually impossible. Here, we capitalize on a long-term genetic data set collected from black bears ( Ursus americanus) ( N = 2422) in the Northern Lower Peninsula ( NLP) of Michigan, USA. We identified mated pairs using parentage analysis and applied logistic regression (selection) models that controlled for features of the social network, to quantify the effects of individual characteristics, and spatial and population demographic factors on mating dynamics. Logistic regression models revealed that black bear mating was associated with spatial proximity of mates, male age, the time a pair had coexisted, local population density and relatedness. Mated pairs were more likely to contain older males. On average, bears tended to mate with nearby individuals to whom they were related, which does not support the existence of kin recognition in black bears. Pairwise relatedness was especially high for mated pairs containing young males. Restricted dispersal and high male turnover from intensive harvest mortality of NLP black bears are probably the underlying factors associated with younger male bears mating more often with female relatives. Our findings illustrate how harvest has the potential to disrupt the social structure of game species, which warrants further attention for conservation and management. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Understanding how individuals modify their social interactions in response to infectious disease is of central importance for our comprehension of how disease dynamics operate in real-world populations. Whilst a significant amount of theoretical work has modelled disease transmission using network models, we have comparatively little understanding of how infectious disease impacts on the social behaviour of individuals and how these effects scale up to the level of the population. We experimentally manipulated the parasite load of female guppies ( Poecilia reticulata) and introduced fish either infected with the ectoparasites Gyrodactylus spp. (experimental) or uninfected (control) into replicated semi-natural populations of eight size-matched female guppies. We quantified the behaviour and social associations of both the introduced fish and the population fish. We found that infected experimental fish spent less time associating with the population fish than the uninfected control fish. Using information on which fish initiated shoal fission (splitting) events, our results demonstrate that the population fish actively avoided infected experimental fish. We also found that the presence of an infected individual resulted in a continued decline in social network clustering up to at least 24 h after the introduction of the infected fish, whereas in the control treatment, the clustering coefficient showed an increase at this time point. These results demonstrate that the presence of a disease has implications for both the social associations of infected individuals and for the social network structure of the population, which we predict will have consequences for infectious disease transmission.

AB  - Social networks arise from complex interactions among multiple individuals and affect the emergent properties of groups (e.g. cooperation, disease spread, information transfer, etc.). Cooperation among nonkin is generally predicted to be favoured in structured social networks where individuals primarily interact only with certain individuals. Long-tailed manakins, Chiroxiphia linearis , form lek groups of as many as 15 unrelated males, whose members can attend multiple leks. At each lek, several top-ranked males perform the majority of obligate cooperative courtship displays. We used exponential random graph (ERG) modelling to analyse manakin cooperation networks constructed from 2-year time intervals over a 14-year study period. ERG modelling evaluates how local processes contribute to formation of global social network structure. We found that four local processes of link formation largely explained the overall structure of male manakin cooperation networks: (1) the spatial proximity of birds: males were more likely to cooperate if they primarily displayed at the same or neighbouring leks; (2) social status of birds: males were more likely to cooperate as they moved up the social queue at leks; (3) triad closure: males were more likely to cooperate with a ‘friend of a friend’ than with males with which they did not share a mutual partner; and (4) link persistence: males were more likely to cooperate with males whom they had cooperated with in the past. Other plausible mechanisms, such as selective mixing (the tendency to interact with individuals of similar or dissimilar social status) and preferential attachment by degree (whereby individuals with many social links gain additional links) did not consistently explain the structure of male cooperation networks at leks. These local processes may facilitate cooperation among long-tailed manakins by creating structured social networks in which males interact with only a subset of the population.

AB  - Aim To investigate the role of alien plants in mutualistic plant-hummingbird networks, assessing the importance of species traits, floral abundance and insularity on alien plant integration. Location Mainland and insular Americas. Methods We used species-level network indices to assess the role of alien plants in 21 quantitative plant-hummingbird networks where alien plants occur. We then evaluated whether plant traits, including previous adaptations to bird pollination, and insularity predict these network roles. Additionally, for a subset of networks for which floral abundance data were available, we tested whether this relates to network roles. Finally, we tested the association between hummingbird traits and the probability of interaction with alien plants across the networks. Results Within the 21 networks, we identified 32 alien plant species and 352 native plant species. On average, alien plant species attracted more hummingbird species (i.e. aliens had a higher degree) and had a higher proportion of interactions across their hummingbird visitors than native plants (i.e. aliens had a higher species strength). At the same time, an average alien plant was visited more exclusively by certain hummingbird species (i.e. had a higher level of complementary specialization). Large alien plants and those occurring on islands had more evenly distributed interactions, thereby acting as connectors. Other evaluated plant traits and floral abundance were unimportant predictors of network roles. Short-billed hummingbirds had higher probability of including alien plants in their interactions than long-billed species. Main conclusions Once incorporated into plant-hummingbird networks, alien plants appear strongly integrated and, thus, may have a large influence on network dynamics. Plant traits and floral abundance were generally poor predictors of how well alien species are integrated. Short-billed hummingbirds, often characterized as functionally generalized pollinators, facilitate the integration of alien plants. Our results show that plant-hummingbird networks are open for invasion. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Trophic interactions among multiple species are ubiquitous in nature and their importance for structuring ecological communities has been extensively demonstrated at local spatial scales. However, how local species interactions scale-up to large spatial scales and how they contribute to shape species distributions and diversity patterns at macroecological extents remains less clear. Here, we provide an overview of recent and potential future developments in macroecology that explore the role of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among multiple species across trophic levels. Recent studies broadly represent two analytical methods (analyses of species richness and ecological networks) and provide evidence that plant-animal interactions (e.g. pollination, frugivory) and predator-prey interactions influence large-scale richness patterns and that ecological network structure varies systematically at macroscales. Current methodological problems and challenges are related to defining the functional links in cross-trophic richness analyses, understanding trait effects in multispecies interactions, and addressing sampling effects when analyzing multiple ecological networks across large spatial extents. Key topics for future research are 1) testing paleoclimatic imprints on interaction diversity, 2) understanding macroevolution and the phylogenetic structure of multispecies interactions, 3) quantifying contemporary spatial and temporal variability in complex ecological networks, and 4) predicting novel interactions under global change. Moreover, we see great potential for a deeper bidirectional integration of macroecology and network research, e.g. by analyses of trait complementarity and functional diversity of interacting groups and by employing species distribution modeling to predict changes in functional network structure. Addressing these key topics and achieving a better integration between these two research fields will significantly advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary drivers of multispecies interactions. This could also help to develop more realistic forecasts of changes in biodiversity under climate and land use change. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Different types of Drosophila dopaminergic neurons (DANs) reinforce memories of unique valence and provide state-dependent motivational control [ 1 ]. Prior studies suggest that the compartment architecture of the mushroom body (MB) is the relevant resolution for distinct DAN functions [ 2 , 3 ]. Here we used a recent electron microscope volume of the fly brain [ 4 ] to reconstruct the fine anatomy of individual DANs within three MB compartments. We find the 20 DANs of the γ5 compartment, at least some of which provide reward teaching signals, can be clustered into 5 anatomical subtypes that innervate different regions within γ5. Reconstructing 821 upstream neurons reveals input selectivity, supporting the functional relevance of DAN sub-classification. Only one PAM-γ5 DAN subtype γ5(fb) receives direct recurrent feedback from γ5β′2a mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) and behavioral experiments distinguish a role for these DANs in memory revaluation from those reinforcing sugar memory. Other DAN subtypes receive major, and potentially reinforcing, inputs from putative gustatory interneurons or lateral horn neurons, which can also relay indirect feedback from MBONs. We similarly reconstructed the single aversively reinforcing PPL1-γ1pedc DAN. The γ1pedc DAN inputs mostly differ from those of γ5 DANs and they cluster onto distinct dendritic branches, presumably separating its established roles in aversive reinforcement and appetitive motivation [ 5 , 6 ]. Tracing also identified neurons that provide broad input to γ5, β′2a, and γ1pedc DANs, suggesting that distributed DAN populations can be coordinately regulated. These connectomic and behavioral analyses therefore reveal further complexity of dopaminergic reinforcement circuits between and within MB compartments. • Nanoscale anatomy reveals additional subtypes of rewarding dopaminergic neurons • Connectomics reveals input specificity to subtypes of dopaminergic neurons • Axon morphology implies dopaminergic neurons provide subcompartment-level function • Unique dopaminergic subtypes serve aversive memory extinction and sugar learning Otto et al. use electron microscope resolution connectomics to describe the structure and organization of neurons providing synaptic input to functionally discrete subtypes of dopaminergic neurons. The nanoscale anatomy reveals further anatomical and functional specialization of dopaminergic neurons, which is confirmed with behavioral experiments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - ABSTRACT Resource management agencies must be able to integrate current research into their decision-making to effectively address climate change impacts. In this study, we investigated the capacity for climate-adaptive management by surveying the community of researchers, administrators, and field managers who are responsible for wildlife conservation in the state of Wisconsin, USA. We specifically measured differences in how these sectors perceive climate change risk, communicate, and make decisions to represent barriers in how they transmit and use research. We frame these barriers within the literature on evidence-based and adaptive management and risk psychology, as principles that underlie climate change adaptation. Almost all respondents agreed that the climate is changing (223/224), but 22% of the respondents were unsure whether climate change is negative for wildlife and field managers dominated this group (68%). Field managers also reported using components of adaptive management more frequently than did other sectors, but all three questioned the importance of one specific component: predicting the consequence of management before implementation. When seeking information, researchers preferred communicating via published literature, but managers and administrators reported a preference for in-person communication. Although only 29% of the respondents were currently involved in climate change work, 77% said they would get involved without additional incentives or direction at work. These results confirm a common pattern of barriers between research and management sectors across all scales of decision-making. Overall, results suggest that in-person and problem-based communication that is focused on real decisions and that utilizes social networks are a way to enable resource management communities to effectively confront these barriers.

AB  - When brought into captivity, wild animals can adapt to domestication within 10 generations. Such adaptations may decrease fitness in natural conditions. Many selective pressures are disrupted in captivity, including social behavioral networks. Although lack of sociality in captivity appears to mediate domestication, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Additionally, determining the contribution of genetic inheritance vs. transgenerational effects during relaxed selection may provide insight into the flexibility of adaptation. When wild-derived mice kept under laboratory conditions for eight generations were reintroduced to sociality and promiscuity (free mate choice), they adapted within two generations. Fitness assessments between this promiscuous lineage and a monogamous laboratory lineage revealed male-specific effects. Promiscuous-line males had deficits in viability, but a striking advantage in attracting mates, and their scent marks were also more attractive to females. Here, we investigate mechanistic details underlying this olfactory signal and identify a role of major urinary protein (MUP) pheromones. Promiscuous-line males inherit higher MUP expression than monogamous-line males through transgenerational inheritance. Sociality-driven maternal and paternal effects reveal intriguing conflicts among parents and offspring over pheromone expression. MUP up-regulation is not driven by hormone-driven transduction pathways, but rather is associated with reduction in DNA methylation of a CpG dinucleotide in the promoter. This reduction in methylation could enhance transcription by promoting the binding of transcription factor USF1 (upstream stimulatory factor 1). Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that increased MUP expression is a female attractant. These results identify molecular mechanisms guiding domestication and adaptive responses to fluctuating sociality. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Empirical studies on structuring mechanisms of metacommunities usually focus on the major roles of environmental filtering and dispersal. Recent works suggest that the relative importance of these structuring mechanisms differs among organisms with different body size, taxonomic affiliation, and dispersal abilities, and also depends on spatial extent and environmental heterogeneity. However, the effects of physical connectivity among sites and dispersal mode are less commonly considered explicitly in field metacommunity studies., We analysed a rock-pool animal metacommunity, comparing both environmental and spatial effects between a set of pools in a ravine setting, with ephemeral connecting waterways, and another in a hill setting, without such connections. We also analysed the relative role of structuring mechanisms influencing active versus passive dispersers in the metacommunity. We used permutational multivariate analysis of variance and analysis of the multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions to compare environmental and species variation between landscape settings. Variation partitioning was applied to determine the percentage of species variation explained by environmental and spatial variables., The relative influence of the structuring mechanisms depended on both the landscape connectivity context and species dispersal mode. Species sorting drove active-disperser metacommunities in both isolated and waterway connected pools, suggesting that these animals had a dispersal rate among the environmentally suitable sites that was adequate to compensate for extinctions at the spatial scale we considered. In addition, beta diversity of active dispersers and species-sorting effects were higher in the set of ravine rock pools that were more environmentally heterogeneous and connected by waterways. In contrast, species sorting structured passive-disperser metacommunities only in the set of pools with connecting waterways, whereas spatial constraints more strongly affected passive dispersers in the relatively more isolated hillside pools., Overall, environmental variables had a greater effect than spatial variables on rock-pool metacommunities at the scale we studied, with the exception that passive dispersers in rock pools unconnected by waterways did tend to have spatially constrained distributions.

AB  - Alcohol is the most commonly abused substance among adolescents, promoting the development of substance use disorders and compromised decision-making in adulthood. We have previously demonstrated, with a preclinical model in rodents, that adolescent alcohol use results in adult risk-taking behavior that positively correlates with phasic dopamine transmission in response to risky options, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that adolescent alcohol use may produce maladaptive decision-making through a disruption in dopamine network dynamics via increased GABAergic transmission within the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Indeed, we find that increased phasic dopamine signaling after adolescent alcohol use is attributable to a midbrain circuit, including the input from the pedunculopontine tegmentum to the VTA. Moreover, we demonstrate thatVTAdopamine neurons from adult rats exhibit enhanced IPSCs after adolescent alcohol exposure corresponding to decreased basal dopamine levels in adulthood that negatively correlate with risk-taking. Building on these findings, we develop a model where increased inhibitory tone on dopamine neurons leads to a persistent decrease in tonic dopamine levels and results in a potentiation of stimulus-evoked phasic dopamine release that may drive risky choice behavior. Based on this model, we take a pharmacological approach to the reversal of risk-taking behavior through normalization of this pattern in dopamine transmission. These results isolate the underlying circuitry involved in alcohol-induced maladaptive decision-making and identify a novel therapeutic target. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In conventional membrane bioreactor (MBR) treatment systems, Gram-negative bacterial population appears to be always outnumbered Gram-positive community. Thereby, acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), major signaling molecules utilized by Gram-negative bacteria, have been targeted for biofouling control in quorum quenching (QQ) based studies. This study investigated the impact of AHL and autoinducer-2 (AI-2)-degrading QQ consortium on the selective accumulation of microbial communities in a QQ MBR (MBR-QQb). The results show that addition of the QQ consortium (in the form of beads) increased the filtration time of MBR-QQb by 3.5 times. The distribution of mixed liquor extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), especially the tightly bound (TB) proteinous EPS and the floc size were strongly affected by the QQ activity, and the endless 'battle' between QQ and quorum sensing (QS). More importantly, QQ induced the significant suppression of Gram-negative bacterial community. The average abundance of Gram-positive bacteria at the genus level in the biocake of MBR-QQb (51%) was significantly higher than that of the control MBR (11%) and the MBR with vacant beads (28%). These findings suggest that an unintended condition is created to favor the growth of Gram-positive bacteria in QQ MBRs, resulting in a distinct microbial social network in both bulk sludge and biocake. Image 1 • QQ changed sludge morphology via controlling TB-EPS and PS/PN in EPS. • The endless 'battle' between QQ and QS resulted in huge varations in sludge floc size and EPS content. • AHL based QQ altered microbial composition, thus facilitated Gram-positive community. • Survival of QQ strains within beads need to be maintained and monitored.

AB  - Summary Network resilience to perturbation is fundamental to functionality in systems ranging from synthetic communication networks to evolved social organization [ 1 ]. While theoretical work offers insight into causes of network robustness, examination of natural networks can identify evolved mechanisms of resilience and how they are related to the selective pressures driving structure. Female African elephants ( Loxodonta africana ) exhibit complex social networks with node heterogeneity in which older individuals serve as connectivity hubs [ 2, 3 ]. Recent ivory poaching targeting older elephants in a well-studied population has mirrored the targeted removal of highly connected nodes in the theoretical literature that leads to structural collapse [ 4, 5 ]. Here we tested the response of this natural network to selective knockouts. We find that the hierarchical network topology characteristic of elephant societies was highly conserved across the 16-year study despite ∼70% turnover in individual composition of the population. At a population level, the oldest available individuals persisted to fill socially central positions in the network. For analyses using known mother-daughter pairs, social positions of daughters during the disrupted period were predicted by those of their mothers in years prior, were unrelated to individual histories of family mortality, and were actively built. As such, daughters replicated the social network roles of their mothers, driving the observed network resilience. Our study provides a rare bridge between network theory and an evolved system, demonstrating social redundancy to be the mechanism by which resilience to perturbation occurred in this socially advanced species.

AB  - The emergence of novel diseases represents a major hurdle for the recovery of endangered populations, and in some cases may even present the threat of extinction. In recent years, epizootics of infectious diseases have emerged as a major threat to marine mammal populations, particularly group-living odontocetes. However, little research has explored the potential consequences of novel pathogens in endangered cetacean populations. Here, we present the first study predicting the spread of infectious disease over the social network of an entire free-ranging cetacean population, the southern resident killer whale community (SRKW). Utilizing 5 years of detailed data on close contacts between individuals, we build a fine-scale social network describing potential transmission pathways in this population. We then simulate the spread of cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) over this network. Our analysis suggests that the SRKW population is highly vulnerable to CeMV. The majority of simulations resulted in unusual mortality events (UMEs), with mortality rates predicted to be at least twice the recorded maximum annual mortality. We find only limited evidence that this population's social structure inhibits disease spread. Vaccination is not likely to be an efficient strategy for reducing the likelihood of UMEs, with over 40 vaccinated individuals (>50% of the population) required to reduce the likelihood of UMEs below 5%. This analysis highlights the importance of modelling efforts in designing strategies to mitigate disease, and suggests that populations with strong social preferences and distinct social units may still be highly vulnerable to disease outbreaks.

AB  - In brood-caring species, family members are faced with a conflict over resource distribution. While parents are selected to adapt the amount of care according to their offspringï¿½s needs, offspring might be selected to demand more care than optimal for parents. Recent studies on birds have shown that the social network structure of offspring affects the amount of care and thus the fitness of families. Such a network structure of repeated interactions is probably influenced by within-brood relatedness.We experimentally manipulated the group composition in a brood-caring spider to test howthe presence of unrelated spiderlings affects the dynamics between female and brood as well as within broods. Broods consisting of siblings grew better and had a lower mortality compared with mixed broods, no matter whether the caring female was a genetic or foster mother. Interestingly, we found that foster mothers lost weight when caring for sibling broods, whereas females caring for mixed broods gained weight. This indicates that females may be willing to share more prey when the brood contains exclusively siblings even if the entire brood is unrelated to the female. Resource distribution may thus be negotiated by offspring dynamics that could have a signalling function to females. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Habitat transformation is one of the leading drivers of biodiversity loss. The ecological effects of this transformation have mainly been addressed at the demographic level, for example, finding extinction thresholds. However, interpopulation genetic variability and the subsequent potential for adaptation can be eroded before effects are noticed on species abundances. To what degree this is the case has been difficult to evaluate, partly because of the lack of both spatially extended genetic data and an appropriate framework to map and analyse such data. Here, we extend recent work on the analysis of networks of spatial genetic variation to address the robustness of these networks in the face of perturbations. We illustrate the potential of this framework using the case study of an amphibian metapopulation. Our results show that while the disappearance of some spatial sites barely changes the modular structure of the genetic network, other sites have a much stronger effect. Interestingly, these consequences can not be anticipated using topological, static measures. Mapping these networks of spatial genetic variation will allow identifying significant evolutionary units and how they vanish, merge and reorganise following perturbations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Sexual coercion results from extreme conflict over mating. As a male strategy to overcome female resistance, coercion can impose fitness costs on females. Among mammals, most cases involve single males or temporary coalitions, with allied aggression towards females being rare. Among Shark Bay bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops cf. aduncus , male alliances harass, guard and consort with females to obtain mating access, which has known physical costs to females. However, the behavioural and ecological costs of sexual coercion to females remain largely unexplored. Given the importance of individual differences in ranging and habitat use for dolphin foraging ecology, social networks and fitness, we hypothesized that male coercion also imposes ecological costs on females. Using 25 years of longitudinal data, we examined how adult male presence relates to female space use, and we found that females ( N = 32) altered their ranging when associating with adult males but also when they were cycling. Additionally, females reduced the use of their primary (preferred) habitat when with males, but cycling had no effect. Ranging shifts were slightly greater for males than for females when they were together, but only for females did this alter their spatial ecology. While it is also possible that males follow fertile females and/or that females move to avoid males, the well-documented coercive mating system suggests that males, as part of their coercive mating tactics, sequester females to areas that females would not otherwise occupy. Our results show that in a coercive mating system, males can alter females' basic behavioural ecology, and suggest that males spatially sequester individual females via allied consortships.

AB  - Social structure in group-living animals is defined by the nature and patterning of social interactions among members of the society. Social structure is shaped in large part by kinship and competition among group members, but can also be influenced by affiliative interactions among both kin and nonkin and can vary based on sex differences in dispersal patterns and social dynamics. Chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, live in fission–fusion societies in which males form strong dyadic bonds and have social networks that can influence the social structure of the community. Females are generally less gregarious than males and bonding among females is considered rare or absent in East African populations. Although females in some populations are known to form ‘neighbourhoods’, these are assumed to reflect passive spatial arrangements. In this study I used data on female chimpanzee association and social interactions to examine how social dynamics among the dispersing sex influence social structure at Ngogo, Kibale National Park. Females at Ngogo were relatively gregarious and exhibited association preferences that extended beyond the dyadic level. Females formed distinct association clusters termed ‘cliques’ within which affiliative interactions occurred more than expected by chance. In addition, association patterns were found to be active social units and not a by-product of space use overlap. These findings demonstrate that intrasexual bonding is not limited to males in this population and that female social relationships, not just those of males, can influence chimpanzee grouping patterns and the corresponding social structure of the community. This study contributes to our growing understanding chimpanzee behavioural diversity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Forecasting population persistence in environments subjected to periodic disturbances represents a general challenge for ecologists. In arid and semiarid regions, climate change and human water use pose significant threats to the future persistence of aquatic biota whose populations typically depend on permanent refuge waterholes for their viability. As such, habitats are increasingly being lost as a result of decreasing runoff and increasing water extraction. We constructed a spatially explicit population model for golden perch Macquaria ambigua (Richardson), a native freshwater fish in the Murray-Darling Basin in eastern Australia. We then used the model to examine the effects of increased aridity, increased drought frequency, and localized human water extraction on population viability. Consistent with current observations, the model predicted golden perch population persistence under the current climate and levels of water use. Modeled increases in local water extraction greatly increased the risk of population decline, while scenarios of increasing aridity and drought frequency were associated with only minor increases in this risk. We conclude that natural variability in abundances and high turnover rates (extinction/recolonization) of local populations dictate the importance of spatial connectivity and periodic cycles of population growth. Our study also demonstrates an effective way to examine population persistence in intermittent and ephemeral river systems by integrating spatial and temporal dynamics of waterhole persistence with demographic processes (survival, recruitment, and dispersal) within a stochastic modeling framework. The approach can be used to help understand the impacts of natural and anthropogenic drivers, including water resource development, on the viability of biota inhabiting highly dynamic environments.

AB  - The influence of space on the structure (e.g. modularity) of complex ecological networks remains largely unknown. Here, we sampled an individual-based plant-pollinator network by following the movements and flower visits of marked bumblebee individuals within a population of thistle plants for which the identities and spatial locations of stems were mapped in a 50 × 50 m study plot. The plant-pollinator network was dominated by parasitic male bumblebees and had a significantly modular structure, with four identified modules being clearly separated in space. This indicated that individual flower visitors opted for the fine-scale division of resources, even within a local site. However, spatial mapping of network modules and movements of bumblebee individuals also showed an overlap in the dense center of the plant patch. Model selection based on Akaike information criterion with traits as predictor variables revealed that thistle stems with high numbers of flower heads and many close neighbours were particularly important for connecting individuals within the modules. In contrast, tall plants and those near the patch center were crucial for connecting the different modules to each other. This demonstrated that individual-based plant-pollinator networks are influenced by both the spatial structure of plant populations and individual-specific plant traits. Additionally, bumblebee individuals with long observation times were important for both the connectivity between and within modules. The latter suggests that bumblebee individuals will still show locally restricted movements within sub-patches of plant populations even if they are observed over a prolonged time period. Our individual-based and animal-centered approach of sampling ecological networks opens up new avenues for incorporating foraging behaviour and intra-specific trait variation into analyses of plant-animal interactions across space.

AB  - Abstract: Group-living animals need to trade off the benefits and the costs of close proximity to conspecifics. Benefits can be increased, and costs reduced by preferentially choosing specific locations within a group best adjusted to an individual’s needs or by associating with specific group members and/or avoiding others. We investigated the spatial structure of meerkat (Suricata suricatta) groups and whether it was shaped by social factors such as affiliation or aggression among group members, predation risk, foraging success, or a mix of these different factors. Using social network analyses, based on spatial networks, we found associations between the dominant pair, among males and among same aged individuals, and dis-assortment by sex only in one to two of the six groups. In addition, the structure of meerkat groups was highly variable, as individual strength within the calculated networks was not repeatable over time. Meerkats seemed to adjust their location to their physical environment, as dominant individuals were located further toward the front of the group, where foraging success is likely higher and young individuals located further toward the back of the group, where they can benefit most from the vigilance effort of their conspecifics. We conclude that meerkat groups display a dynamic spatial structure depending on both the current social and physical environmental. Significance: Group-living animals can achieve greater benefits from close association with conspecifics by choosing specific locations within a group or associating with specific group members and/or avoiding others. A considerable body of work has examined how differences in predation risk or foraging success affect the relative location of individuals within a group. Several studies investigated the association between individuals, in order to draw conclusions on the social structure. However, it is important to disentangle the impact of all of these different aspects on the spatial structure of a group. Here, we provide evidence that both the social and physical environment is important for the spatial assortment of meerkats, a social mongoose foraging in cohesive groups. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Friend of a friend relationships, or the indirect connections between people, influence our health, well-being, financial success and reproductive output. As with humans, social behaviours in other animals often occur within a broad interconnected network of social ties. Yet studies of animal social behaviour tend to focus on associations between pairs of individuals. With the increase in popularity of social network analysis, researchers have started to look beyond the dyad to examine the role of indirect connections in animal societies. Here, I provide an overview of the new knowledge that has been uncovered by these studies. I focus on research that has addressed both the causes of social behaviours, i.e. the cognitive and genetic basis of indirect connections, as well as their consequences, i.e. the impact of indirect connections on social cohesion, information transfer, cultural practices and fitness. From these studies, it is apparent that indirect connections play an important role in animal behaviour, although future research is needed to clarify their contribution. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Actin filament networks assemble on cellular membranes in response to signals that locally activate neural Wiskott-Aldrich-syndrome protein (N-WASP) and the Arp2/3 complex. An inactive conformation of N-WASP is stabilized by intramolecular contacts between the GTPase binding domain (GBD) and the C helix of the verprolin-homology, connector-helix, acidic motif (VCA) segment. Multiple SH3 domain-containing adapter proteins can bind and possibly activate N-WASP, but it remains unclear how such binding events relieve autoinhibition to unmask the VCA segment and activate the Arp2/3 complex. Here, we have used purified components to reconstitute a signaling cascade driven by membrane-localized Src homology 3 (SH3) adapters and N-WASP, resulting in the assembly of dynamic actin networks. Among six SH3 adapters tested, Nck was the most potent activator of N-WASP-driven actin assembly. We identify within Nck a previously unrecognized activation motif in a linker between the first two SH3 domains. This linker sequence, reminiscent of bacterial virulence factors, directly engages the N-WASP GBD and competes with VCA binding. Our results suggest that animals, like pathogenic bacteria, have evolved peptide motifs that allosterically activate N-WASP, leading to localized actin nucleation on cellular membranes.

AB  - Across sexually reproducing species, males and females are in conflict over the control of reproduction. At the heart of this conflict in a number of taxa is male harassment of females for mating opportunities and female strategies to avoid this harassment. One neglected consequence that may result from sexual harassment is the disruption of important social associations. Here, we experimentally manipulate the degree of sexual harassment that wild female guppies (Poecilia reticulata) experience by establishing replicated, semi-natural pools with different population sex ratios. We quantify the effects of sexual harassment on female social structure and the development of social recognition among females. When exposed to sexual harassment, we found that females had more disparate social networks with limited repeated interactions when compared to females that did not experience male harassment. Furthermore, females that did not experience harassment developed social recognition with familiar individuals over an 8-day period, whereas females that experienced harassment did not, an effect we suggest is due to disruption of association patterns. These results show that social network structure and social recognition can be affected by sexual harassment, an effect that will be relevant across taxonomic groups and that we predict will have fitness consequences for females.

AB  - Understanding the processes leading to population declines in fragmented landscapes is essential for successful conservation management. However, isolating the influence of disparate processes, and dispersal in particular, is challenging. The Grey Shrike-thrush, CoHuricincla harmonica, is a sedentary woodland-dependent songbird, with learned vocalizations whose incidence in suitable habitat patches falls disproportionally with decline in tree cover in the landscape. Although it has been suggested that gaps in tree cover might act as barriers to its dispersal, the species remains in many remnants of native vegetation in agricultural landscapes, suggesting that it may have responded to habitat removal and fragmentation by maintaining or even increasing dispersal distances. We quantified population connectivity of the Grey Shrike-thrush in a system fragmented over more than 120 years using genetic (microsatellites) and acoustic (song types) data. First, we tested for population genetic and acoustic structure at regional and local scales in search of barriers to dispersal or gene flow and signals of local spatial structuring indicative of restricted dispersal or localized acoustic similarity. Then we tested for effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on genetic and acoustic connectivity by fitting alternative models of mobility (isolation-by-distance [the null model] and reduced and increased movement models) across treeless vs. treed areas. Birds within ∼5 km of each other had more similar genotypes and song types than those farther away, suggesting that dispersal and song matching are limited in the region. Despite restricted dispersal detected for females (but not males), populations appeared to be connected by gene flow and displayed some cultural (acoustic) connectivity across the region. Fragmentation did not appear to impact greatly the dispersal of the Grey Shrike-thrush: none of the mobility models fit the genetic distances of males, whereas for females, an isolation-by-distance model could not be rejected in favor of the models of reduced or increased movement through treeless gaps. However, dissimilarities of the song types were more consistent with the model of reduced cultural connectivity through treeless areas, suggesting that fragmentation impedes song type sharing in the Grey Shrike-thrush. Our paper demonstrates that habitat fragmentation hinders important population processes in an Australian woodland bird even though its dispersal is not detectably impacted. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - As invasive species become integrated into existing communities, they engage in a wide variety of trophic interactions with other community members. Many of these interactions are direct (e.g. predator-prey interactions or interference competition), but invasive species also can affect native community members indirectly, by influencing the abundances of intermediary species in trophic webs. Observational studies suggest that invasive plant species affect herbivorous arthropod communities and that these effects may flow up trophic webs to influence the abundance of predators. However, few studies have experimentally manipulated the presence of invasive plants to quantify the effects of plant invasion on higher trophic levels. Here, I use comparisons across sites that have or have not been invaded by the invasive plant Medicago polymorpha, combined with experimental removals of Medicago and insect herbivores, to investigate how a plant invasion affects the abundance of predators. Both manipulative and observational experiments showed that Medicago increased the abundance of the exotic herbivore Hypera and predatory spiders, suggesting positive bottom-up effects of plant invasions on higher trophic levels. Path analyses conducted on data from natural habitats revealed that Medicago primarily increased spider abundance through herbivore-mediated indirect pathways. Specifically, Medicago density was positively correlated with the abundance of the dominant herbivore Hypera, and increased Hypera densities were correlated with increased spider abundance. Smaller-scale experimental studies confirmed that Medicago may increase spider abundance through herbivore-mediated indirect pathways, but also showed that the effects of Medicago varied across sites, including having no effect or having direct effects on spider abundance. If effects of invasive species commonly flow through trophic webs, then invasive species have the potential to affect numerous species throughout the community, especially those species whose dynamics are tightly connected to highly-impacted community members through trophic linkages.

AB  - Artificial reefs have been deployed in France since 1968 with the principal objective of enhancing success and continuity of artisanal fishing. Over 50 % of the volume of reef material has been deployed since 2000. Because of significant expansion of reef construction and availability of new research results concerning their performance since the late 1990s, we examined status and trends of French artificial reefs. Since the review of Barnabé et al. (Artificial reefs in European seas, ), 35 reports have been published and are analyzed here. Fish assemblages on artificial reefs have been the focus of ecological research, with emphasis on species richness and abundance. Fish production has been associated with the age of artificial reefs and the reef's structural complexity. The perception of stakeholders toward artificial reefs is a notable area of investigation. Economic studies are absent. Other developments in French artificial reefs over the last 10-15 years include the discontinued use of waste materials in reef construction, more directed design of reef structure, and the inclusion of additional objectives concerning biodiversity and recreation. Recommendations here include development of long-term ecological studies of artificial reefs and the evaluation of fishery production, including issues such as trophic dynamics, ecological connectivity of habitats, and socio-economic studies.

AB  - Abstract: Intraspecific allometric calculations of the brain to body size relation revealed distinct differences between 127 (67; 60) ancestral wild cavies and 82 (37; 45) guinea pigs, their domesticated relatives. The dependency of both measures from one another remained the same in both animal groups but the brains of guinea pigs were by 14.22% smaller at any net body weight. Consistent with results in other species the domestication of Cavia aperea is also characterized by a decrease of brain size. Fresh tissue sizes of the five brain parts medulla oblongata, cerebellum, mesencephalon, diencephalon and telencephalon were determined for 6 cavies and 6 guinea pigs by the serial section method. Additionally the sizes of 16 endbrain structures and those of the optic tract, the lateral geniculate body and the cochlear nucleus were measured. Different decrease values resulted for all these structures concomitant with domestication as was calculated from the amount of total brain size decrease and average relative structure values in the wild as well as the domesticated brain. The size decrease of the entire telencephalon (−13.7%) was within the range of the mean overall reduction as similarly was the case for the total neocortex (−10.7%) whereas the total allocortex (−20.9%) clearly was more strongly affected. The size decrease of the olfactory bulb (−41.9%) was extreme and clearly higher than found for the secondary olfactory structures (around −11%). The primary nuclei of other sensory systems (vision, audition) were decreased to less extent (lateral geniculate: −18.1%; cochlear nucleus: −12.6%). Mass decreases of pure white matter parts were nearly twice as high in contrast to associated grey matter parts (neocortex white versus grey matter; tractus opticus versus lateral geniculate body). The relatively great decrease values found for the limbic structures hippocampus (−26.9%) and schizocortex (−25.9%) are especially notable since they are in good conformity with domestication effects in other mammalian species. The findings of this study are discussed with regard to results of similar investigations on wild and domesticated gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus), the encephalization of the wild form, the special and species-specific mode and duration of domestication and in connection with certain behavioral changes as resulted from comparative investigations in ethology, socio-biology, endocrinology and general physiology.

AB  - A critical aspect in the design of a marine reserve (MR) network is its spatial configuration (i.e., the number, size, and spacing of the individual reserves), particularly how these features influence the effect on fisheries. Here, we derived a size-based, spatially explicit, stochastic demographic model to explore how different spatial configurations of MR networks can affect abundance and commercial yield of the green abalone ( Haliotis fulgens), taking as a reference case the abalone fishery of Isla Natividad in Baja California Sur (Mexico). Our analysis suggests that a network of MRs can have a positive effect on abalone population abundance and a slightly negative effect on fishery output with respect to traditional maximum sustainable yield (MSY; i.e., with no reserves). Simulations show that maximum catches achievable with MRs are, under the best configuration, ∼2%-14% lower than traditional MSY depending on the total fraction of the fishing grounds protected. In the case of overexploitation, long-term yields can increase following the implementation of MRs. In addition, in the presence of MRs, abundances and yields are much less sensitive to systematic errors in the enforcement of the optimal harvesting rate compared with situations in which MRs are not present. Given the limited dispersal ability of the species, the best outcomes in terms of fishery output would be achieved with very small reserves - around 100 m wide - so to maximize larval export in the fishable areas. Our results indicate appropriately designed MR networks are an effective strategy for meeting both conservation and economic goals under uncertainty. While the size of the existing reserves in Isla Natividad seems adequate to protect the abalone stock, smaller reserves could maximize fishery benefits, although this poses challenges for enforcement.

AB  - Although pathogen transmission dynamics are profoundly affected by population social and spatial structure, few studies have empirically demonstrated the population-level implications of such structure in wildlife. In particular, epidemiological models predict that the extent to which contact patterns are clustered decreases a pathogen’s ability to spread throughout an entire population, but this effect has yet to be demonstrated in a natural population. Here, we use network analysis to examine patterns of transmission of an environmentally transmitted parasite, Cryptosporidium spp., in Belding’s ground squirrels ( Spermophilus beldingi). We found that the prevalence of Cryptosporidium was negatively correlated with transitivity, a measure of network clustering, and positively correlated with the percentage of juvenile males. Additionally, network transitivity decreased when there were higher percentages of juvenile males; the exploratory behavior demonstrated by juvenile males may have altered the structure of the network by reducing clustering, and low clustering was associated with high prevalence. We suggest that juvenile males are critical in mediating the ability of Cryptosporidium to spread through colonies, and thus may function as “super-spreaders.” Our results demonstrate the utility of a network approach in quantifying mechanistically how differences in contact patterns may lead to system-level differences in infection patterns.

AB  - Summary The blastema is a mass of progenitor cells that enables regeneration of amputated salamander limbs or fish fins. Methodology to label and track blastemal cell progeny has been deficient, restricting our understanding of appendage regeneration. Here, we created a system for clonal analysis and quantitative imaging of hundreds of blastemal cells and their respective progeny in living adult zebrafish undergoing fin regeneration. Amputation stimulates resident cells within a limited recruitment zone to reset proximodistal (PD) positional information and assemble the blastema. Within the newly formed blastema, the spatial coordinates of connective tissue progenitors are predictive of their ultimate contributions to regenerated skeletal structures, indicating early development of an approximate PD pre-pattern. Calcineurin regulates size recovery by controlling the average number of progeny divisions without disrupting this pre-pattern. Our longitudinal clonal analyses of regenerating zebrafish fins provide evidence that connective tissue progenitors are rapidly organized into a scalable blueprint of lost structures.

AB  - Because zoos typically house animals for extended periods of time, longitudinal studies can play an important role in evaluating and optimizing animal care and management. For example, information on patterns of aggression and mating behavior across years can be used to monitor well-being, assess response to changes to group composition, and promote successful reproduction. Here, we report on patterns of aggression and pair bonding by American flamingos ( Phoenicopterus ruber) at the Audubon Zoo, New Orleans USA across 4 years (2012-2015), a period that included a simultaneous introduction and removal of individuals in 2014. At the population level, overall rates and social network indices of aggressive interactions were relatively stable over the study period, without a strong signal of the 2014 replacement event. At the individual level, flamingos exhibited a high degree of within-individual consistency in levels of aggression initiated ( W = 0.530, P < 0.001), and received ( W = 0.369, P = 0.042). In terms of pair bonds, females re-paired with the same individuals across years more frequently (between 58% and 100% from year to year) than they switched mates, and no bonds were established between pre-existing and introduced individuals. These findings indicate a high degree of stability in aggression and pair bonding behavior in this population of captive flamingos, at both the population and individual level. Longitudinal studies such as this one provide an opportunity to better our understanding of flamingos and other long-lived, group-living animals along with their management needs, especially in terms of maintaining social cohesion in captivity and improving captive breeding programs.

AB  - Animal behaviour and the ecology and evolution of parasites are inextricably linked. For this reason, animal behaviourists and disease ecologists have been interested in the intersection of their respective fields for decades. Despite this interest, most research at the behaviour-disease interface focuses either on how host behaviour affects parasites or how parasites affect behaviour, with little overlap between the two. Yet, the majority of interactions between hosts and parasites are probably reciprocal, such that host behaviour feeds back on parasites and vice versa. Explicitly considering these feedbacks is essential for understanding the complex connections between animal behaviour and parasite ecology and evolution. To illustrate this point, we discuss how host behaviour-parasite feedbacks might operate and explore the consequences of feedback for studies of animal behaviour and parasites. For example, ignoring the feedback of host social structure on parasite dynamics can limit the accuracy of predictions about parasite spread. Likewise, considering feedback in studies of parasites and animal personalities may provide unique insight about the maintenance of variation in personality types. Finally, applying the feedback concept to links between host behaviour and beneficial, rather than pathogenic, microbes may shed new light on transitions between mutualism and parasitism. More generally, accounting for host behaviour-parasite feedbacks can help identify critical gaps in our understanding of how key host behaviours and parasite traits evolve and are maintained.

AB  - ABSTRACT Objectives Policing is a conflict-limiting mechanism observed in many primate species. It is thought to require a skewed distribution of social power for some individuals to have sufficiently high social power to stop others' fights, yet social power has not been examined in most species with policing behavior. We examined networks of subordination signals as a source of social power that permits policing behavior in rhesus macaques. Materials and Methods For each of seven captive groups of rhesus macaques, we (a) examined the structure of subordination signal networks and used GLMs to examine the relationship between (b) pairwise dominance certainty and subordination network pathways and (c) policing frequency and social power (group-level convergence in subordination signaling pathways). Results Networks of subordination signals had perfect linear transitivity, and pairs connected by both direct and indirect pathways of signals had more certain dominance relationships than pairs with no such network connection. Social power calculated using both direct and indirect network pathways showed a heavy-tailed distribution and positively predicted conflict policing. Conclusions Our results empirically substantiate that subordination signaling is associated with greater dominance relationship certainty and further show that pairs who signal rarely (or not at all) may use information from others' signaling interactions to infer or reaffirm the relative certainty of their own relationships. We argue that the network of formal dominance relationships is central to societal stability because it is important for relationship stability and also supports the additional stabilizing mechanism of policing.

AB  - Groups or aggregations of animals can result from individuals being attracted to a common resource or because of synchronised patterns of daily or seasonal activity. Although mostly solitary throughout its distribution, white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias) seasonally aggregate at a number of sites worldwide to feed on calorie-rich pinnipeds. At the Neptune Islands, South Australia, large numbers of white sharks can be sighted throughout the year, including during periods of low seal abundance. We use a combination of photo-identification and network analysis based on co-occurrence of individuals visiting the site on the same day to elucidate the population structure and aggregatory behaviour of Australia's largest aggregation of sub-adult and adult white sharks. We photo-identified 282 sharks (183 males, 97 females, 2 unknown) over a 4.5-year period (June 2010–November 2014) and found that white sharks did not randomly co-occur with their conspecifics, but formed four distinct communities. Tendency to co-occur varied across months with males co-occurring with more individuals than females. Sex-dependent patterns of visitation at the Neptune Islands and resulting intraspecific competition likely drive the observed community structure and temporal variability in co-occurrences. This study provides new insights into the aggregatory behaviour of white sharks at a seal colony and shows for the first time that white shark co-occurrence can be non-random. Significance statement: White sharks are top marine predators that are typically solitary but can also form aggregations around seal colonies to feed. Using a combination of photo-identification and network analysis, we investigated the co-occurrence patterns of white sharks. We showed, for the first time, that white sharks form non-random associations with conspecifics. We hypothesise that the observed sex-dependant variations in co-occurrence are linked to intraspecific competition for resources, providing new insights into the aggregatory behaviour of white sharks at a seal colony. Our study adds to the growing literature of animals showing non-random interaction or co-occurrence patterns, providing important comparative knowledge for other researchers as it broadens our knowledge to marine top predators.

AB  - In social species that form hierarchies where only dominant males reproduce, lower-ranking individuals may challenge higherranking ones, often resulting in changes in relative social status. How does a losing animal respond to loss of status? Here, using the African cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, we manipulated the social environment, causing males to descend in rank, and then examined changes in behavior, circulating steroids and immediate early gene (IEG) expression (cfos, egr-1) in micro-dissected brain regions as a proxy for neuronal activation. In particular, we examined changes in the conserved 'social behavior network' (SBN), a collection of brain nuclei known to regulate social behaviors across vertebrates. Astatotilapia burtoni has rapidly reversible dominant-subordinate male phenotypes, so that within minutes, descending males lost their bright body coloration, switched to submissive behaviors and expressed higher plasma cortisol levels compared with non-descending and control males. Descending males had higher IEG expression throughout the SBN, but each brain region showed a distinct IEG-specific response in either cfos or egr-1 levels, but not both. Overall, SBN IEG patterns in descending males were distinctly different from the pattern observed in males ascending (subordinate to dominant) in social status. These results reveal that the SBN rapidly coordinates the perception of social cues about status that are of opposite valence, and translates them into appropriate phenotypic changes. This shows for the first time in a non-mammalian vertebrate that dropping in social rank rapidly activates specific socially relevant brain nuclei in a pattern that differs from when males rise to a higher status position.

AB  - Social network analysis is being increasingly used in epidemiology and disease modeling in humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. We investigated this tool in describing a translocation network (area that allows movement of animals between geographically isolated locations) used for the conservation of an endangered flightless rail, the Takahe (Porphyrio hochstetteri). We collated records of Takahe translocations within New Zealand and used social network principles to describe the connectivity of the translocation network. That is, networks were constructed and analyzed using adjacency matrices with values based on the tie weights between nodes. Five annual network matrices were created using the Takahe data set, each incremental year included records of previous years. Weights of movements between connected locations were assigned by the number of Takahe moved. We calculated the number of nodes (i<sub>total</sub>) and the number of ties (t<sub>total</sub>) between the nodes. To quantify the small-world character of the networks, we compared the real networks to random graphs of the equivalent size, weighting, and node strength. Descriptive analysis of cumulative annual Takahe movement networks involved determination of node-level characteristics, including centrality descriptors of relevance to disease modeling such as weighted measures of in degree (k<sub>i</sub><sup>in</sup>), out degree (k<sub>i</sub><sup>out</sup>), and betweenness (B<sub>i</sub>). Key players were assigned according to the highest node measure of k<sub>i</sub><sup>in</sup>, k<sub>i</sub><sup>out</sup>, and B<sub>i</sub> per network. Networks increased in size throughout the time frame considered. The network had some degree small-world characteristics. Nodes with the highest cumulative tie weights connecting them were the captive breeding center, the Murchison Mountains and 2 offshore islands. The key player fluctuated between the captive breeding center and the Murchison Mountains. The cumulative networks identified the captive breeding center every year as the hub of the network until the final network in 2011. Likewise, the wild Murchison Mountains population was consistently the sink of the network. Other nodes, such as the offshore islands and the wildlife hospital, varied in importance over time. Common network descriptors and measures of centrality identified key locations for targeting disease surveillance. The visual representation of movements of animals in a population that this technique provides can aid decision makers when they evaluate translocation proposals or attempt to control a disease outbreak.

AB  - The complex interrelationships among individuals within social environments can exert selection pressures on social skills: those behaviours and cognitive processes that allow animals to manipulate and out-reproduce others. Social complexity can also have a developmental effect on social skills by providing individuals with opportunities to hone their skills by dealing with the challenges posed in within-group interactions. We examined how social skills develop in captive, adult male brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater) that were exposed to differing levels of 'social complexity' across a 2-year experiment. After each year, subjects housed in groups with dynamic social structure (where many individuals entered and exited the groups during the year) outcompeted birds who had been housed in static groups. Exposure to dynamic structure subsequently led to substantial changes to the social networks of the home conditions during the breeding season. Static groups were characterized by a predictable relationship between singing and reproductive success that was stable across years. In dynamic conditions, however, males showed significant variability in their dominance status, their courting and even in their mating success. Reproductive success of males varied dramatically across years and was responsive to social learning in adulthood, and socially dynamic environments 'trained' individuals to be better competitors, even at an age when the development of many traits important for breeding (like song quality) had ended.

AB  - Access to food is of major importance to the fitness and survival of every individual, particularly in group‐living animals, in which individual characteristics and food distribution can affect food intake. Additionally, several species of primates are known to share food under certain conditions. Such unresisted transfer of food from one individual to another appears to be adaptive, for instance as a tool to maintain and reinforce social bonds. In this study, we aimed to test how food retrieval and food sharing varies depending on the social relationship between individuals, and on the characteristics of the food. In six different test conditions, we provided a captive group of Guinea baboons (Papio papio, N = 23) with multiple food items, differing in quality, quantity, density, monopolizability, and effort required to obtain it. We further used behavioral observations to assess individual relationships and possible variations in grooming exchanges linked to food sharing events. Out of 424 events in which food items were retrieved by the subjects, we detected no instances of active food sharing and only 17 of passive food sharing. The way food was retrieved was affected by individual and food characteristics (i.e., quantity, quality, and monopolizability of food): Males and central individuals (i.e., those connected to many partners, and/or having partners with many connections in the social network) were more likely to retrieve food during test conditions. In particular, events of passive food sharing mostly happened when the quality of food was low, and between individuals belonging to the same community (i.e., having close relationships). No other food characteristics affected the probability to share food, and the occurrence of food sharing had no immediate effect on grooming exchanges. Overall, our findings suggest that food sharing is relatively rare in Guinea baboons unless the food has a low quality and individuals form close social bonds. Research Highlights: We tested food retrieval and food sharing in a group of captive Guinea baboons in six different feeding conditions.No active sharing and no begging were observed.Sex and position in the social network affected the probability of retrieving food; food quality and position in the social network affected the probability of retrieving food through passive sharing.

AB  - Although processes involved in the relationship between hyporheic and benthic zone have been elucidated in recent years, the spatial and temporal dynamics of the invertebrate assemblages is unclear in alpine streams. A field study was carried out in a glacier-fed stream and in its main spring-fed tributary, in the Italian Alps. Benthic hyporheic connectivity was investigated by means of a pond net, a pump, and artificial substrates. The main determinant in structuring the community was the habitat (=benthic, hyporheic), accounting for 22% of the total faunal variation. A strong similarity was detected between the two streams in structure, function, and species seasonal variations of the hyporheos, that was, in both, more species rich than the benthos. In contrast, benthos was generally very different between the two streams, with a more pronounced turnover in the glacier-fed than in the spring-fed stream. Overall, the highly disturbed glacial system hosted a simplified benthos and hyporheos compared to the stable spring system, in agreement with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Our findings provided also evidences about the trophic-sink effect between benthos and hyporheos. Spatial connectivity that we highlighted might have a key role in the dispersal of invertebrates facing changes in habitats features due to climate change. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Mixed-species social aggregations are common across taxa. There are two, nonexclusive, hypotheses typically proposed to explain the formation of social groups: increased predator vigilance and greater foraging efficiency. In mixed-species groups, these hypotheses are typically tested with species-level summary measures such as flocking propensity, the assignment of species-level roles, mean body size, and foraging and habitat characteristics. Literature syntheses make it clear that while these hypotheses are important, much about mixed-species groups remains unexplained. We suggest that we can substantially increase our understanding of the evolution and ecology of mixed-species social groups in terms of both traditional and novel hypotheses by shifting the analytical focus to bottom-up approaches common in intraspecific investigations of sociality. Bottom-up approaches to analyses of social structure treat pairwise interactions as the fundamental unit of analysis and social structure as an emergent property rather than relying on a priori assignments of species as units of association. The construction of social networks from pairwise interaction rates allows us to assess the factors that promote group formation on the basis of individuals, a more appropriate level of selection, rather than species groups. We illustrate this approach with data from mixed-species foraging assemblies in tits (Paridae), finding significant effects of dominance on social behaviour within species. This new focus allows us to address questions about active associations among heterospecifics, the role of individuals within mixed-species societies, and the role of environments, which will collectively provide a richer description of the evolution and function of mixed-species societies.

AB  - Co-management constitutes a certain type of institutional arrangement that has gained increased attention among both policy makers and researchers involved in the field of natural resource management. Yet the concept of co-management is broad, and our knowledge about how different kinds of management structures affect the ability to deal with challenges pertinent to the commons is limited. One of these challenges is to foster an adaptive management process, i.e., a process in which rules are continuously revised and changed according to what is known about the ecological system. We aim to address the relationship between different kinds of co-management structures and adaptive management. To this end, we conducted a comparative case study of two Fishery Conservation Areas in Sweden. The concept of networks and the formal method of social network analysis are applied as theoretical and methodological devices. Building on previous research, we propose that adaptive management processes occur in co-management networks consisting of a heterogeneous set of actors that are centrally and densely integrated. Networks of this kind are believed to promote a management process in which actors with disparate perspectives and resources formulate a common view regarding the condition of the ecosystem, the basic problem to be solved, and what measures to adopt. The empirical findings support the existence of such a relationship. Nonetheless, the restricted empirical material, an inability to control for hidden variables, and a lack of success in determining causality among variables are all factors that call for more research.

AB  - The persistence and size of social groups can be plastic and governed by ecological selection or be under greater genetic control and constrained by phylogenetic inertia. Comparing sociality of phylogenetically divergent populations under the same ecological conditions or between groups within a population under different ecological conditions can identify the relative influence of ecological selection on group formation. Here, we compare the size and persistence of social groups within a community of Atlantic killer whales, comparing between data collected from an area around Scotland where the whales have mainly been seen to hunt seals and data collected from an area around Iceland where the whales have mainly been seen to hunt herring. Additionally, we compare the observed social structure with that of previously studied Pacific ecotypes. Atlantic killer whale groups in both locations had a stable long-term primary social tier (association index level > 0.8) similar to that of Pacific killer whales. However, associations between these groups were much lower when hunting for seals than for fish in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. The occurrence of these differences in sociality between Atlantic groups, which are linked in a single social network, suggests that ecological selection partially determines sociality in this species. Furthermore, if sociality was constrained by phylogenetic inertia, then the Atlantic killer whales would all be expected to be more similar to the Pacific fish-eating ecotype than the more phylogenetically distant Pacific mammal-eating ecotype. Our study suggests that sociality in killer whales is to some extent plastic and can be adapted to the local ecological conditions. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Using the unregulated, eutrophic Someş River ( Romania/ Hungary), a tributary of the Upper Tisza River as a model system, we related phytoplankton growth to the structure of river network modified by human intervention., The Time- Averaged Phytoplankton Increase in Rivers ( TAPIR) model was developed by adding two new modules (nitrogen emission and phytoplankton growth) to the PHOSFATE model. The latter was a raster-based, long-term average GIS tool that computed the flow tree, mean hydrology and phosphorus concentration at fine spatial resolution in the entire catchment. Long-term monitoring data at the outflow and phytoplankton profiles obtained along the Someş River in 2012 were used to calibrate the models., In summer 2012, a few centric diatom species dominated the phytoplankton, with mean apparent net growth rate of 2.5 day<sup>−1</sup> along a ˜100-km-long upstream section of the Someş River. This high growth rate was explained by enhanced benthic retention of meroplanktonic diatoms, while further downstream mean algal biomass varied between 80 and 100 mg Chl m<sup>−3</sup>., The TAPIR model realistically reproduced observed mean biomass profiles of phytoplankton in the Someş River. According to modelling results, P-determined biomass capacity prevented further growth of algae along the lower two-thirds of the river., Channel slope and form were important reach-scale determinants of phytoplankton recruitment, while the absence of large tributaries along the Someş River resulted in marginal longitudinal changes in dilution and light availability. Therefore, phytoplankton might achieve high biomass in a wide range of instantaneous net growth rates realised under strongly fluctuating environmental conditions, which combined with the abundant nutrients from urban areas underpins advanced eutrophication. Large montane reservoirs on tributaries increased mean water age at the outflow of the Someş catchment by an order of magnitude compared with pristine conditions, but had a negligible overall impact on the phytoplankton of the Someş River., Growth of river phytoplankton is intrinsically linked with network topology, including spatial distribution of nutrient inputs. Stochastic variability in discharge tends to destabilise, while specific network properties may stabilise phytoplankton growth in large rivers. Shallow rivers support meroplanktonic diatoms that, depending on discharge, may have adequate time to develop summer blooms, making shallow rivers particularly susceptible to eutrophication.

AB  - Participatory research in which experts and non-experts are co-researchers in addressing local concerns (also known as participatory action research or community-based research) can be a valuable approach for dealing with the uncertainty of social-ecological systems because it fosters learning among stakeholders and co-production of knowledge. Despite its increased application in the context of natural resources and environmental management, evaluation of participatory research has received little attention. The objectives of this research were to define criteria to evaluate participatory research processes and outcomes, from the literature on participation evaluation, and to apply them in a case study in an artisanal fishery in coastal Uruguay. Process evaluation criteria (e.g., problem to be addressed of key interest to local and additional stakeholders; involvement of interested stakeholder groups in every research stage; collective decision making through deliberation; and adaptability through iterative cycles) should be considered as conditions to promote empowering participatory research. Our research contributes to knowledge on evaluation of participatory research, while also providing evidence of the positive outcomes of this approach, such as co-production of knowledge, learning, strengthened social networks, and conflict resolution.

AB  - Abstract: Worldwide demand for food will increase dramatically in the future as global human population grows. Increasing efficiency of crop production is unlikely to be sufficient to meet the demand, presenting a long-term threat to humanity’s ‘well-being’. Knowledge of the system-level behaviour of agroecosystems, however, remains surprisingly limited, reflecting the agricultural focus on particular species. This is starting to change towards an ecosystem and network-based approach, following the recent revolution in thinking about resource use and sustainability in our other global food production industry: commercial fisheries. Agroecosystems appear to retain plasticity of ecological processes that might be manipulated for productivity and sustainability. Network structure and dynamics have substantial impacts on ecosystem performance, but evidence from agroecosystems lags behind network theory. Here, we provide an introduction to network theory and application in agroecosystems, identify network metrics for management and environmental change, and, finally, we highlight gaps in our current knowledge and key research themes. These themes include: is the structure of agroecological networks affected by sampling; how do ecosystem services ‘emerge’ empirically from ecological organization, function and network properties; how do spatial and temporal scale and resolution influence system performance; and, can network agroecology be used to design systems that maximize ecosystem services?

AB  - Advances over the last 15 years have made social network analysis (SNA) a powerful tool for the study of nonhuman primate social behavior. Although many SNA-based techniques have been only very recently adopted in primatological research, others have been commonly used by primatologists for decades. The roots of SNA also stem from some of the same conceptual frameworks as the majority of nonhuman primate behavioral research. The rapid development of SNA in recent years has led to questions within the primatological community of where and how SNA fits within this field. We aim to address these questions by providing an overview of the historical relationship between SNA and the study of nonhuman primates. We begin with a brief history of the development of SNA, followed by a detailed description of the network-based visualization techniques, analytical methods and conceptual frameworks which have been employed by primatologists since as early as the 1960s. We also introduce some of the latest advances to SNA, thereby demonstrating that this approach contains novel tools for the study of nonhuman primate social behavior which may be used to shed light on questions that cannot be addressed fully using more conventional methods.

AB  - To address biodiversity loss and secure livelihoods reliant on natural resources, environmental governance is increasingly focused on connecting local management to higher scales of policy and planning. Governance networks can foster cross-scale relations between actors for collective purposes. We examine a governance network of non-governmental organizations, government agencies, and local communities involved in adaptive co-management of coastal ecosystems in Solomon Islands. We use quantitative social network analysis to examine patterns of collaborative and knowledge-exchange relations among agencies. We examine network structure alongside qualitative data to understand the potential of the network to facilitate coordination and learning among management actors. We identify social networks that transcend the formal membership of the governance network. Cross-scale analysis highlights that network members are the only functional pathway for cross-scale knowledge-exchange and higher-level representation of local issues. We find midscale managers (e.g., provincial governments) are poorly connected. The governance network also provides the primary means for knowledge-exchange between agencies and is important for multi-actor learning about best practice for conservation. Yet, we identify geographic, logistical, and institutional barriers and tradeoffs to multi-actor and cross-scale coordination and learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study was designed to address whether juvenile small spotted catsharks Scyliorhinus canicula aggregate and to determine whether potential aggregation is underpinned by social preferences for conspecifics. Using controlled and replicated experiments, the role of familiarity as a potential mechanism driving aggregation and social behaviour in this species was considered. Observed S. canicula association data compared to null model simulations of random distributions revealed differences in aggregation under different social contexts. Only familiar juvenile S. canicula aggregated more than would be expected from random distribution across their habitat. Familiarity increased the mean number of groups but did not significantly affect mean group size. Significant preference and avoidance behaviour across all groups were also observed. Furthermore, the strength of social attraction, quantified by the mean association index, was significantly higher in groups containing familiar individuals. Mixed familiar and unfamiliar treatments were also conducted to test for within- and between-group effects, finding high variation across replicates with some groups assorting by familiarity and others not. It is believed that this study is the first to examine experimentally the influence of conspecific familiarity on aggregation behaviour in sharks. These results not only imply a functional benefit to aggregation, but also suggest that persistent social affiliation is likely to influence dispersal following hatching in this small benthic elasmobranch.

AB  - 1. Theory predicts that natural selection should favour females that are able to correctly assess the risk of predation and then use that information to avoid high-risk oviposition sites to reduce the risk of offspring predation. Despite the potential significance of such behaviour on individual fitness, population dynamics and community structure, relatively few studies of oviposition behaviour connected to the risk of predation have been carried out. 2. However, some recent studies suggest that oviposition site selection in response to risk of predation may be a common phenomenon, at least among amphibians and mosquitoes. A vast majority of previous studies have, however, neglected to investigate how the offspring are affected, in terms of fitness related parameters, by the maternal oviposition site choice. 3. In an outdoor artificial pond experiment we tested the oviposition site selection of female aquatic beetles ( Hydroporus spp.) in relation to the presence or absence of a predatory fish ( Perca fluviatilis). In addition, we monitored how the oviposition site selection affected the behaviour, growth and food resource of the progeny. 4. We show that free-flying females of the aquatic beetles Hydroporus incognitus and H. nigrita prefer to oviposit in waters without fish compared with waters with fish. Larval activity of Hydroporus spp. was unaffected by fish presence. Our results indicate that beetle larvae from females that do lay eggs in waters with fish show increased growth compared with larvae in waters without fish. We explain this difference in growth by a higher per-capita food supply in the presence of a fish predator. This finding may have important implications for our understanding of how the variance of oviposition site selection in a population is sustained. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Multilevel social systems have evolved in several species of cercopithecoid primates and appear to be an effective means of changing group size amid variation in environmental conditions. Larger groupings of these species fission and fuse, making intraunit relationships essential to maintain the integrity of the smallest social units. We examine these intraunit relationships in four primates with multilevel social systems: proboscis monkeys ( Nasalis larvatus), snub-nosed monkeys ( Rhinopithecus roxellana), hamadryas baboons ( Papio hamadryas), and geladas ( Theropithecus gelada), using social network analysis. The proboscis monkeys and hamadryas baboons were wild and unprovisioned, whereas the snub-nosed monkeys and geladas were partly provisioned. Comparison of eigenvector centrality coefficients revealed a phylogenetic difference in the key individuals maintaining social networks between the colobines and the cercopithecines: females were more central in proboscis and snub-nosed monkeys, with males generally peripheral to social interaction, whereas males were more central than females in geladas and hamadryas. A comparison of sex differences in clustering coefficients, however, revealed a significant difference only in geladas, suggesting that one-male-multifemale units in this species become more unstable when females, but not males, are removed from social networks. Taken together, our results reveal the strongest differences between geladas, characterized by female philopatry and male dispersal, and the three species with bisexual dispersal. These results demonstrate the potential for social network analysis to reveal the social bonds most important for maintaining cohesion of the smallest units of primate multilevel societies. This, in turn, can serve as a proxy, in the absence of long-term data, for underlying patterns of sex-biased dispersal and philopatry. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Lost or discarded fishing nets are a significant component of marine debris which has trans-boundary impacts in large marine ecosystems. Such ‘ghost nets’ cause the by-catch of marine fauna and require retrieval from coastlines where they wash up. Identifying the causes of discarded nets and feasible intervention points requires analysis of a complex value chain and the stakeholders within it, yet no studies have attempted this. In this paper we combine Value Chain Analysis, commonly applied to understand value-adding for a commodity, with elements of Life Cycle Assessment and social network analysis to examine the drivers, stakeholders, economic, environmental and social costs and benefits in the life of a trawl net. We use the Arafura Sea as a case study, which is shared by Indonesia, Papua New Guinea and Australia, and is the focus of a Trans-boundary Diagnostic Assessment (TDA) within the Arafura–Timor Seas Ecosystem Action program (ATSEA). We follow a trawl net through four sub-systems: manufacture of webbing in South Korea, fishing and loss by an Indonesian vessel, retrieval as ghost net on the northern Australian coastline by Indigenous rangers, and disposal or re-cycling as ‘GhostNet Art’ by Indigenous artists. Primary stakeholders along the value chain incur economic and social benefits, and economic and environmental costs. There is an anomaly in the chain between Indonesian fishermen and Indigenous rangers, artists and communities due to the lack of market linkages between these primary stakeholders. The first ‘nexus of influence’ where reductions in net losses and environmental costs can be achieved is through interactions between GhostNets Australia, the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Australian Government, which can influence Indonesian fishery management institutions and fishing crews. The second nexus is via the international art market which by publicising GhostNet Art can raise awareness amongst fish consumers about the impacts of ghost nets, and hence influence Indonesian fishing companies. GhostNets Australia is a key bridging organisation in the network, linking stakeholders across scales and sub-systems. Feasible preventative interventions are discussed to rectify the anomaly in the value chain. The importance of GhostNets Australia and ATSEA in the evolving adaptive co-management and trans-boundary governance of fisheries is highlighted. However, the prevention of ghost nets will result in trade-offs in benefits for the livelihoods of primary stakeholders. The utility of the method for analysing marine debris in TDAs, and ATSEA in particular, is discussed. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Some larval helminths alter the behavior of their intermediate hosts in ways that favor the predation of infected hosts, thus enhancing trophic transmission. Gammarids (Crustacea: Amphipoda) offer unique advantages for the study of the proximate factors mediating parasite-induced behavioral changes. Indeed, amphipods infected by distantly related worms (acanthocephalans, cestodes and trematodes) encysted in different microhabitats within their hosts (hemocoel, brain) present comparable, chronic, behavioral pathologies. In order to evaluate the potential connection between behavioral disturbances and immune responses in parasitized gammarids, this Review surveys the literature bearing on sensorimotor pathway dysfunctions in infected hosts, on the involvement of the neuromodulator serotonin in altered responses to environmental stimuli, and on systemic and neural innate immunity in arthropods. Hemocyte concentration and phenoloxidase activity associated with melanotic encapsulation are depressed in acanthocephalan-manipulated gammarids. However, other components of the arsenal deployed by crustaceans against pathogens have not yet been investigated in helminth-infected gammarids. Members of the Toll family of receptors, cytokines such as tumor necrosis factors (TNF5), and the free radical nitric oxide are all implicated in neuroimmune responses in crustaceans. Across animal phyla, these molecules and their neuroinflammatory signaling pathways are touted for their dual beneficial and deleterious properties. Thus, it is argued that neuroinflammation might mediate the biochemical events upstream of the serotonergic dysfunction observed in manipulated gammarids - a parsimonious hypothesis that could explain the common behavioral pathology induced by distantly related parasites, both hemocoelian and cerebral.

AB  - Abstract: In social animals, fission is a common mode of group proliferation and dispersion and may be affected by genetic or other social factors. Sociality implies preserving relationships between group members. An increase in group size and/or in competition for food within the group can result in decrease certain social interactions between members, and the group may split irreversibly as a consequence. One individual may try to maintain bonds with a maximum of group members in order to keep group cohesion, i.e. proximity and stable relationships. However, this strategy needs time and time is often limited. In addition, previous studies have shown that whatever the group size, an individual interacts only with certain grooming partners. There, we develop a computational model to assess how dynamics of group cohesion are related to group size and to the structure of grooming relationships. Groups’ sizes after simulated fission are compared to observed sizes of 40 groups of primates. Results showed that the relationship between grooming time and group size is dependent on how each individual attributes grooming time to its social partners, i.e. grooming a few number of preferred partners or grooming equally or not all partners. The number of partners seemed to be more important for the group cohesion than the grooming time itself. This structural constraint has important consequences on group sociality, as it gives the possibility of competition for grooming partners, attraction for high-ranking individuals as found in primates’ groups. It could, however, also have implications when considering the cognitive capacities of primates. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Abstract: In 2008–2009 a Rift Valley Fever (RVF) outbreak occurred in the Anjozorobe area, a temperate and mountainous area of the Madagascar highlands. The results of a serosurvey conducted in 2009 suggested recurrent circulation of RVF virus (RVFV) in this area and potential involvement of the cattle trade in RVFV circulation. The objective of this study was to describe the cattle trade network of the area and analyse the link between network structure and RVFV circulation. Five hundred and sixteen animals that tested negative in 2009 were sampled again in 2010. The 2009–2010 cattle-level seroconversion rate was estimated at 7% (95% CI: 5–10%). Trade data from 386 breeders of 48 villages were collected and analysed using social network analysis methodology, nodes being villages and ties being any movements of cattle connecting villages. The specific practice of cattle barter, known as kapsile, that involves frequent contacts between cattle of two breeders, was observed in addition to usual trade. Trade data were analysed using a logistic model, the occurrence of seroconversion at the village level being the outcome variable and the network centrality measures being the predictors. A negative association was observed between the occurrence of seroconversion in the village and introduction of cattle by trade (p =0.03), as well as the distance to the nearest water point (p =0.002). Conversely, the practice of kapsile, was a seroconversion risk factor (p =0.007). The kapsile practice may be the support for inter-village RVFV circulation whereas the trade network is probably rather implicated in the introduction of RVFV to the area from other parts of Madagascar. The negative association of the distance to the nearest water point suggests that after RVFV introduction, a substantial part of transmission may be due to vectors. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - About 190,000 ha of higher-elevation marl prairies flank either side of Shark River Slough in the southern Everglades. Water levels typically drop below the ground surface each year in this landscape. Consequently, peat soil accretion is inhibited, and substrates consist either of calcitic marl produced by algal periphyton mats or exposed limestone bedrock. The southern marl prairies support complex mosaics of wet prairie, sawgrass sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), tree islands, and tropical hammock communities and a high diversity of plant species. However, relatively short hydroperiods and annual dry downs provide stressful conditions for aquatic fauna, affecting survival in the dry season when surface water is absent. Here, we present a conceptual ecological model developed for this landscape through scientific concensus, use of empirical data, and modeling. The two major societal drivers affecting the southern marl prairies are water management practices and agricultural and urban development. These drivers lead to five groups of ecosystem stressors: loss of spatial extent and connectivity, shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity, extended hydroperiod and drying pattern reversals, introduction and spread of non-native trees, and introduction and spread of non-native fishes. Major ecological attributes include periphyton mats, plant species diversity and community mosaic, Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna prey base, American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis), and wading bird early dry season foraging. Water management and development are hypothesized to have a negative effect on the ecological attributes of the southern marl prairies in the following ways. Periphyton mats have decreased in cover in areas where hydroperiod has been significantly reduced and changed in community composition due to inverse responses to increased nutrient availability. Plant species diversity and community mosaics have changed due to shifting gradients to more terrestrial or more aquatic communities, displacement of native communities by non-natives, expansion of woody plants, high-intensity dry season fires, tree-island burnout, and reduced microtopography resulting from alligator population decline. Cape Sable seaside spar- row populations are threatened by nest destruction resulting from extended hydroperiods, drying pattern reversals, and high intensity dry season fires, as well as by the expansion of woody plants into graminoid wetland habitats. Populations of marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna that constitute the aquatic prey base for higher vertebrates have decreased in density and changed in species composition and size structure due to loss of wetland spatial extent, shortened hydroperiod, increased drought severity, loss of aquatic drought refugia in solution holes and alligator holes, and spread of exotic fishes. American alligator populations have declined in the Rocky Glades, and alligator holes have filled with sediment, as a result of shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity. Habitat options for wading birds to forage during the early dry season and during unusually wet years have been reduced due to loss of spatial extent and shortened hydroperiod.

AB  - Aim AquaticHealth.net is an open-source aquatic biosecurity intelligence gathering and analysis application. The system collects information in much the same way as other similar systems (e.g. HealthMap, Bio Caster). However, the information collected undergoes minimal automated analysis, and analysis is largely left to Aquatic Health.net's users. The result is an automated system of intelligence gathering, combined with a manual system of intelligence analysis. This approach relies on a large number of users, and so Aquatic Health.net relies on an open-intelligence analysis method: any user can publish their own analyses for all to see and analyse further. By combining automated data collection and human analysis, Aquatic Health.net will provide fast and accurate forecasts, accompanied with nuanced explanations. These methods can be applied to other areas of biosecurity and disease surveillance. Location Canberra, Australia; College Park, Maryland, USA; Melbourne, Australia. Methods Automated: Aquatic Health.net performs hourly scans of an array of RSS feeds, blogs, social networks and news sites. It analyses this information and removes redundancies and applies taxonomy and geospatial tags. The information is then pushed to the Daily Scan, where users then analyse it further. Manual: Users assess the information for inaccuracies and its importance. They decide whether an article should be a disease alert, which is emailed to all users. Users can change tags, edit reports, add commentary, apply rankings, change search terms and summarize issues in the Emerging Issues blog (formerly a wiki). Results Aquatic Health.net publishes seven daily reports and 2 weekly disease alerts (on average). Ninety per cent of CEFAS's (www.cefas.defra.gov.uk) Emerging Disease Updates cite Aquatic Health.net. The Australian Sub- Committee for Aquatic Animal Health ( SCAAH) uses the system to compile quarterly reports. The Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry ( DAFF) uses Aquatic Health.net to make forecasts-for example, used aquaculture equipment is a high-risk pathway for Os HV.

AB  - Plants grow in communities where they interact with other plants and with other living organisms such as pollinators. On the one hand, studies of plant–plant interactions rarely consider how plants interact with other trophic levels such as pollinators. On the other, studies of plant–animal interactions rarely deal with interactions within trophic levels such as plant–plant competition and facilitation. Thus, to what degree plant interactions affect biodiversity and ecological networks across trophic levels is poorly understood. We manipulated plant communities driven by foundation species facilitation and sampled plant–pollinator networks at fine spatial scale in a field experiment in Sierra Nevada, Spain. We found that plant–plant facilitation shaped pollinator diversity and structured pollination networks. Nonadditive effects of plant interactions on pollinator diversity and interaction diversity were synergistic in one foundation species networks while they were additive in another foundation species. Nonadditive effects of plant interactions were due to rewiring of pollination interactions. In addition, plant facilitation had negative effects on the structure of pollination networks likely due to increase in plant competition for pollination. Our results empirically demonstrate how different network types are coupled, revealing pervasive consequences of interaction chains in diverse communities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The red imported fire ants, Solenopsis invicta (Buren), are generally considered pests. They have also been viewed as beneficial predators feeding on other insect pests of various agroecosystems. This study documents the foraging habits of fire ants in a sweetpotato field in Mississippi. Fire ant foraging trails connecting outside colonies to a sweetpotato field were exposed and foraging ants moving out of the field toward the direction of the colony were collected along with the solid food particles they were carrying. The food material was classified as arthropod or plant in origin. The arthropod particles were identified to orders. Fire ant foragers carried more arthropods than plant material. Coleoptera and Homoptera were the most abundant groups preyed upon. These insect orders contain various economically important pests of sweetpotato. Other major hexapod groups included the orders Hemiptera, Diptera and Collembola. The quantity of foraged material varied over the season. No damage to sweetpotato roots could be attributed to fire ant feeding. Imported fire ant foraging may reduce the number of insect pests in sweetpotato fields. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The increasing miniaturisation of animal-tracking technology has made it possible to gather exceptionally detailed machine-sensed data on the social dynamics of almost entire populations of individuals, in both terrestrial and aquatic study systems. Here, we review important issues concerning the collection of such data, and their processing and analysis, to identify the most promising approaches in the emerging field of ‘reality mining’. Automated technologies can provide data sensing at time intervals small enough to close the gap between social patterns and their underlying processes, providing insights into how social structures arise and change dynamically over different timescales. Especially in conjunction with experimental manipulations, reality mining promises significant advances in basic and applied research on animal social systems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In an effort to increase conservation effectiveness through the use of Earth observation technologies, a group of remote sensing scientists affiliated with government and academic institutions and conservation organizations identified 10 questions in conservation for which the potential to be answered would be greatly increased by use of remotely sensed data and analyses of those data. Our goals were to increase conservation practitioners' use of remote sensing to support their work, increase collaboration between the conservation science and remote sensing communities, identify and develop new and innovative uses of remote sensing for advancing conservation science, provide guidance to space agencies on how future satellite missions can support conservation science, and generate support from the public and private sector in the use of remote sensing data to address the 10 conservation questions. We identified a broad initial list of questions on the basis of an email chain-referral survey. We then used a workshop-based iterative and collaborative approach to whittle the list down to these final questions (which represent 10 major themes in conservation): How can global Earth observation data be used to model species distributions and abundances? How can remote sensing improve the understanding of animal movements? How can remotely sensed ecosystem variables be used to understand, monitor, and predict ecosystem response and resilience to multiple stressors? How can remote sensing be used to monitor the effects of climate on ecosystems? How can near real-time ecosystem monitoring catalyze threat reduction, governance and regulation compliance, and resource management decisions? How can remote sensing inform configuration of protected area networks at spatial extents relevant to populations of target species and ecosystem services? How can remote sensing-derived products be used to value and monitor changes in ecosystem services? How can remote sensing be used to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of conservation efforts? How does the expansion and intensification of agriculture and aquaculture alter ecosystems and the services they provide? How can remote sensing be used to determine the degree to which ecosystems are being disturbed or degraded and the effects of these changes on species and ecosystem functions?

AB  - The promotion of species-typical behavior and provision of control over their environment will help to improve the psychological well-being of captive primates. The keepers of the gorillas and chimpanzees of Lincoln Park Zoo's Lester E. Fisher Great Ape House (GAH) have incorporated various techniques to promote psychological the primates' mental health. Wild chimpanzees live in a network of complex social relationships. When the captive animals are housed in social groups, they have the choice of interaction and this can trigger their natural behavior. Housing them in complex and more naturalistic environments will promote their species-typical behavior. Providing enough vertical space will encourage species-typical behaviors such as climbing, swinging, and other arboreal locomotion. The circular design of the great ape house provides visual, auditory, and olfactory access to each other. Implementation of environment enrichment techniques will provide the primates more control over their environment and yield positive behavioral effects. The similarity in the feeding procedures in captivity and that in the wild can improve the psychological well being of captive animals. Variety in the diet can be achieved by changing the items and also by changing the method of presentation. Food items that require processing can increase species-typical behavior in captive primates. Stereotypic behavior can be decreased by increasing the number of feedings and an unpredictable feeding schedule. Gorillas and chimpanzees exhibit positive behavior when provided with bedding and manipulable items. The interaction between caretakers and captive primates has positive impact on the well-being of the animals. Studies found that positive reinforcement training has improved the behavior of captive animals. Maintaining a monthly calendar of enrichment will be helpful in finding the best options for the psychological well-being of captive primates (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - Noise is a ubiquitous feature in natural as well as in urban habitats. The presence of noise can have multiple direct and indirect effects on communication. Noise can directly mask signals leading to reduced detection and recognition. Noise also affects internal physiological processes which can influence attention and decision rules and, thus, indirectly affect communication. Also community effects of noise leading to lower densities or different community composition with respect to copying style or personality will affect communication through different communication distances and different daily behavioural routines. All these direct and indirect effects of noise on communication have been well documented but often are treated separately. This review focusses on some of the indirect effects of noise on animal communication, considering spatial responses, attentional effects and differential effects of noise depending on an animal's characteristics, its personality. It evaluates how noise can indirectly influence communication and, thus, social network structure and processes of sexual and natural selection. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Location Big data of 158 cows during four months to study their individual and group social dynamics. • We found that sociality is an individual trait, unrelated to the group and relatively persistent once established. • Findings have the potential to help understanding the social dynamic when mixing dairy cows. In many species, animals live in highly structured groups. In these groups, individual differences in the number and identity of social contacts (alters) of each ego define the social network structure of the animal group. The composition of groups can be disturbed by grouping animals according to age or production stage, which can in turn induce stress. We investigated whether the preference of two animals to stay together depends on the sociality of each individual (defined by the time it spends close to other animals) or on the composition of the group. We observed 158 dairy cows distributed in 6 pens during 17 weeks. The precise positions of the cows were monitored with positional loggers 24/7 in two groups with fixed independent populations and during the formation of new groups with varying population. In fixed groups, the sociality of a cow was maintained over the entire observation period, but this trait depended on the area contacts occurred (inside vs. outside the resting area). When introducing foreign individuals into social groups, the sociality of individual cows was maintained independently of the group; this sociality was therefore not necessarily influenced by the time spent in the group but by the social characteristics of individual cows. During the formation of new groups, newly introduced cows dynamically interacted with resident ones, forming a few strong short-lasting contacts between newcomers and resident cows. However, a few long-lasting interactions occurred between resident and newcomers and the whole network is weakened. Our study suggests that each cow has its own sociality independent of the group and tend to establish relations with specific partners when the population is fixed. In addition, when introducing cows into a group, the social network of the group is weakened, with absence of strong links between newcomers and resident cows and a decrease in the links between resident cows for at least 2 weeks.

AB  - Outcome-guided behavior requires knowledge about the current value of expected outcomes. Such behavior can be isolated in the reinforcer devaluation task, which assesses the ability to infer the current value of specific rewards after devaluation. Animal lesion studies demonstrate that orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is necessary for normal behavior in this task, but a causal role for human OFC in outcome-guided behavior has not been established. Here, we used sham-controlled, non-invasive, continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) to temporarily disrupt human OFC network activity by stimulating a site in the lateral prefrontal cortex that is strongly connected to OFC prior to devaluation of food odor rewards. Subjects in the sham group appropriately avoided Pavlovian cues associated with devalued food odors. However, subjects in the stimulation group persistently chose those cues, even though devaluation of food odors themselves was unaffected by cTBS. This behavioral impairment was mirrored in changes in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) activity such that subjects in the stimulation group exhibited reduced OFC network connectivity after cTBS, and the magnitude of this reduction was correlated with choices after devaluation. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of indirectly targeting the human OFC with non-invasive cTBS and indicate that OFC is specifically required for inferring the value of expected outcomes. • Animal orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for responding in the devaluation task • Connectivity-guided TMS of human OFC impairs choices for devalued outcomes • OFC-targeted TMS disrupts orbitofrontal network connectivity, predicting behavior • OFC-targeted TMS does not impair value-based choices in general Howard et al. show that indirectly targeting orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) with TMS disrupts choices that require inference without affecting value-based choices in general. Moreover, TMS reduces OFC network connectivity, and the magnitude of this effect predicts individual differences in the behavioral impairment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Avian mixed-species flocks (MSFs) are an important example of species interactions threatened by the biodiversity crisis. They are found throughout the world in forested habitats but are generally reduced in size or frequency by human disturbance. In southern China, a unique MSF system is led by several species of closely- related fulvettas (Alcippe morrisonia , A. hueti , and A. davidi). Our objective was to understand how this system is distributed across elevational gradients, especially moving west into the Hengduan Mountains, and how it responds to human disturbance. We sampled leadership and composition of 375 MSFs over 2 yr in and surrounding 5 nature reserves in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province, with transects placed in different land use types—protected forest, buffer areas, or agriculture—and ranging from 400 to 3,200 m. We also sampled birds outside of MSFs. We found MSFs led by fulvettas (A. fratercula and A. davidi) in forests across the region up to 2,900 m. Elevation was not a significant influence on MSF size or prevalence in models that also included land use. We found that MSFs were encountered at only one-third of the frequency in agriculture as in forest, and had strongly different composition and leadership. Although MSFs in buffer areas were more similar to those in forest, birds in buffer areas had lower flocking propensity, different flock leaders, and less complex social networks. In particular, buffer transects that were seeded pine had low numbers of fulvetta-led MSFs and forest specialists in MSFs. In the future, it is important to understand which vegetational characteristics allow MSFs, particularly fulvetta-led MSFs, to persist in buffer habitats. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Even though social network analysis provides an important tool to characterize and compare societies, no studies have used its analytical applications to characterize patterns of sociality in bats. Here I use social network analysis to characterize and compare patterns of sociality between three populations of the leaf-roosting bat Thyroptera tricolor. Sites differed in the density of furled leaves used by T. tricolor for roosting. Finca had more leaves per hectare (77), followed by Ureña (58), and Esquinas (7). The time period over which the probability of association is halved based on fitted models was 1,086 days for Finca, 714 days for Ureña, and 303 days for Esquinas. Finca and Ureña had very similar network topologies, with several small clusters, high-clustering coefficients, short path lengths, low node betweenness, and high network robustness. Social networks at Esquinas were composed of one large cluster and several small isolated ones. Esquinas also had high-clustering coefficients, but path length and node betweenness were high. Network resilience was lower in Esquinas compared to Finca and Ureña. These results show that, unlike many other forest-dwelling bats that switch roosts regularly, T. tricolor does not exhibit a typical fission-fusion social system, and that resource availability seems to affect social networks in this bat. In addition, this study highlights the importance of emigrating individuals in maintaining social cohesion, establishing network connectedness, and determining network robustness.

AB  - Infectious disease plays a major role in the lives of wild primates, and the past decade has witnessed significant strides in our understanding of primate disease ecology. In this review, I briefly describe some key findings from phylogenetic comparative approaches, focusing on analyses of parasite richness that use the Global Mammal Parasite Database. While these studies have provided new answers to fundamental questions, new questions have arisen, including questions about the underlying epidemiological mechanisms that produce the broader phylogenetic patterns. I discuss two examples in which theoretical models have given us new traction on these comparative questions. First, drawing on findings of a positive association between range use intensity and the richness of helminth parasites, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to investigate the underlying drivers of this pattern. From this model, we are gaining deeper understanding of how range use intensity results in greater exposure to parasites, thus producing higher prevalence in the simulated populations-and, plausibly, higher parasite richness in comparative analyses. Second, I show how a model of disease spread on social networks provides solid theoretical foundations for understanding the effects of sociality and group size on parasitism across primate species. This study further revealed that larger social groups are more subdivided, which should slow the spread of infectious diseases. This effect could offset the increased disease risk expected in larger social groups, which has yet to receive strong empirical support in our comparative analyses. In addition to these examples, I discuss the need for more meta-analyses of individual-level phenomena documented in the field, and for greater linkage between theoretical modeling and field research.

AB  - Network theory is commonly used to reveal social interactions and the organisation of interconnected nodes—but has not yet been applied to animal invasions. Non-native species invasions are now considered one of the foremost threats to natural ecosystems and biodiversity. This is the first attempt to assess social network properties within a freshwater fish assemblage invaded by a non-native fish species. We show that invasive sunbleak Leucaspius delineatus is socially more strongly interconnected with native species than the native species with each other. The social networks also reveal characteristics of a ‘small world’ such as low clustering coefficients C and short path lengths L. The findings may indicate potential traits of successful invaders and the implication for the spread of pathogens between individuals within a group of animals that contain a non-native invasive species. The success of establishment and subsequent invasion may be highlighted not only by the capacity of the new species to adapt to the new environment, but also in its capacity to penetrate the social circle of the native community.

AB  - • Daily comparison of dominance indices and network parameters 3 days after mixing. • Stable results regarding dominance indices and centralities in daily comparison. • 2 days of observation sufficient to evaluate dominance indices and centralities. • Low correlation for fragmentation and network components in daily comparison. • No stable results after 3 days for fragmentation and network components. Previous studies showed that depending on different factors, such as age, level of familiarity or group size, the number of agonistic interactions in pigs directly after mixing can demonstrate a large variation: from groups which reveal a clear decline in agonistic interactions one day after mixing to groups with highly temporal fluctuations even four days after mixing. Information of these agonistic interactions is often used to calculate dominance indices and is the basis to construct social networks. However, in order to get information about won and lost fights or about the initiator and the receiver of an agonistic interaction, these parameters rely on direct and continuous video observation. Video analysis is, however, very time-consuming, but provides the most accurate results as it measures directly the agonistic behaviour. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate the temporal development of agonistic interactions directly after mixing for weaned piglets, growing pigs and gilts. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of the above described temporal variations on dominance indices as well as on social network parameters. This information is important to determine the most appropriate time span to obtain stable results for dominance indices as well as parameters derived from social network analysis. The results for growing pigs and gilts revealed a significant decrease from 0.6 to 0.2 agonistic interactions/animal/hour one day after mixing (6 h of video observation) (p < 0.05). Although the frequency of agonistic interactions showed a high fluctuation for weaned piglets, the Spearman rank correlation coefficients after two or three days demonstrated high values for dominance indices and for the social network parameters density and all centrality parameters (range: 0.74-0.98). Exceptions were the fragmentation and the size of the largest weakly connected component describing the whole network structure. Here, only low to moderate correlation coefficients were determined. Growing pigs and gilts revealed similar results. With the mentioned exceptions, stable results were obtained already two days after mixing (17 h of video observation) for weaned piglets, i.e. a third day of video observation did not add significant information. For growing pigs and gilts, also a further condensation to just one day after mixing (6 h of video observation) might be possible due to the high correlations. With this knowledge, video analysis in future studies with focus on individuals' rank position derived from dominance indices or centrality parameters can be performed more efficiently by focussing on shortened observation periods.

Simulation modelling as a tool for examining the consequences of spatial structure and connectivity on local and regional population dynamics. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1631–1639.An understanding of the mechanisms underlying population persistence makes fisheries management more effective. A model framework is described, which can test hypotheses about spatial structure and connectivity within and between populations and their influence on the productivity (spawning-stock biomass, SSB), stability (variation in SSB), resilience (time to rebuild SSB after environmental disturbance), and sustainability (maximum sustainable fishing mortality and yield) of systems. The general model consists of linked age-structured submodels that incorporate the unique demographics and dynamics of population components, along with the degree and type of connectivity between them. The flexibility of this framework is illustrated with three case studies examining (i) spatial structure within a population of white perch, (ii) different types and degrees of connectivity between populations of Atlantic herring, and (iii) spatial heterogeneity and connectivity within a stock of Atlantic cod. System variance is reduced by abundant, stable population components, and the asynchronous responses of those components. Components with high productivity contributed disproportionately to the resilience of systems. Increased synchrony of component responses to environmental forcing decreased the stability of the overall system. Simulation modelling is a useful approach to evaluate the consequences of spatial structure and connectivity, and can be used to understand better the productivity and dynamics of local and regional populations.

AB  - Abstract: New management strategies for detecting social instabilities and promoting social cohesion are needed to reduce aggression-based morbidity and mortality among captive groups of rhesus macaques. This study was conducted to determine the utility of social network analysis for deciphering patterns of aggression and wounding in rhesus macaques. Over 37,000 observations of affiliative, submissive and aggressive activities were collected over a 3-year period on ∼1300 rhesus macaques housed in 13.2ha enclosures. Data also were analyzed on management factors such as age/sex composition and matriline configuration that might promote or reduce aggression in rhesus macaques. Results suggest that social network measures such as subordination degree (social power), displacement fragmentation and groom reciprocity within social groups were not only significantly associated with rates of contact aggression and wounding but with the occurrence of severe aggressive outbreaks, known as cage wars. In addition, groups with a lower proportion of adult females and a more uniform distribution in the number of individuals across matrilines exhibited higher social power and lower fragmentation. These data indicate that by manipulating group composition and matriline configuration of social groups to promote social cohesion and stability, behavioral managers may be able to reduce the level of aggression and aggression-based morbidity and mortality. These data also show that social network measures are valuable predictors of deleterious aggression and even cage wars indicating that such measures could be used to longitudinally track changes in social dynamics to detect significant instabilities, allowing managers to prevent severe outbreaks before they occur in populations of rhesus macaques and perhaps other non-human primate species.

AB  - The underlying kin structure of groups of animals may be glimpsed from patterns of spatial position or temporal association between individuals, and is presumed to facilitate inclusive fitness benefits. Such structure may be evident at a finer, behavioural, scale with individuals preferentially interacting with kin. We tested whether kin structure within groups of meerkats Suricata suricatta matched three forms of social interaction networks: grooming, dominance or foraging competitions. Networks of dominance interactions were positively related to networks of kinship, with close relatives engaging in dominance interactions with each other. This relationship persisted even after excluding the breeding dominant pair and when we restricted the kinship network to only include links between first order kin, which are most likely to be able to discern kin through simple rules of thumb. Conversely, we found no relationship between kinship networks and either grooming networks or networks of foraging competitions. This is surprising because a positive association between kin in a grooming network, or a negative association between kin in a network of foraging competitions offers opportunities for inclusive fitness benefits. Indeed, the positive association between kin in a network of dominance interactions that we did detect does not offer clear inclusive fitness benefits to group members. We conclude that kin structure in behavioural interactions in meerkats may be driven by factors other than indirect fitness benefits, and that networks of cooperative behaviours such as grooming may be driven by direct benefits accruing to individuals perhaps through mutualism or manipulation.

AB  - Background: Large-scale inter-basin water transfer (IBWT) projects are commonly proposed as solutions to water distribution and supply problems. These problems are likely to intensify under future population growth and climate change scenarios. Scarce data on the distribution of freshwater fishes frequently limits the ability to assess the potential implications of an IBWT project on freshwater fish communities. Because connectivity in habitat networks is expected to be critical to species' biogeography, consideration of changes in the relative isolation of riverine networks may provide a strategy for controlling impacts of IBWTs on freshwater fish communities. Methods/Principal Findings: Using empirical data on the current patterns of freshwater fish biodiversity for rivers of peninsular India, we show here how the spatial changes alone under an archetypal IBWT project will (1) reduce freshwater fish biodiversity system-wide, (2) alter patterns of local species richness, (3) expand distributions of widespread species throughout peninsular rivers, and (4) decrease community richness by increasing inter-basin similarity (a mechanism for the observed decrease in biodiversity). Given the complexity of the IBWT, many paths to partial or full completion of the project are possible. We evaluate two strategies for step-wise implementation of the 11 canals, based on economic or ecological considerations. We find that for each step in the project, the impacts on freshwater fish communities are sensitive to which canal is added to the network. Conclusions/Significance: Importantly, ecological impacts can be reduced by associating the sequence in which canals are added to characteristics of the links, except for the case when all 11 canals are implemented simultaneously (at which point the sequence of canal addition is inconsequential). By identifying the fundamental relationship between the geometry of riverine networks and freshwater fish biodiversity, our results will aid in assessing impacts of IBWT projects and balancing ecosystem and societal demands for freshwater, even in cases where biodiversity data are limited.

AB  - Abstract: In myriad biological systems, multiple lines of evidence indicate that modularity, wherein parts of a network are organized into modules such as subgroups in animal networks, may affect social transmission processes. In animal societies, there is increased interest in understanding variation in the effects of modularity on transmission as it may provide important insight into a given network’s performance, in addition to the evolutionary consequences the structure of the network may have for individual fitness. Yet, to our knowledge, the degree to which network efficiency is modularity dependent has not yet been investigated in great detail in behavioral and evolutionary ecology. Here, we investigated to what degree network efficiency, as a proxy for social transmission, is modularity dependent. We created 2798 networks varying in group size and density, and tested whether network structure (density, Newman’s modularity, eigenvector centralization) and group size shape network efficiency. We also used published data from 41 primate social networks to test whether the predictions generated in our simulations were supported by empirical observations. Our results show a non-linear relationship between modularity and global efficiency, with the latter peaking at intermediate values of modularity in both theoretical and empirical networks. This phenomenon may have relevance for observed variation in social structure and its link with network performance. Our results may thus provide a basis from which to discuss the evolution of complex systems such as animal societies.Significance statement: Networks may maximize performance and minimize transmission costs, as demonstrated in neural networks, but to what degree network efficiency is modularity dependent has not yet been investigated in behavioral ecology. We provide evidence that modularity, such as subgrouping in animal networks, can have non-linear effects on transmission processes, with low values of modularity tending to positively influence social transmission and high values tending to negatively influence transmission. This pattern was consistent across small, medium, and large social groups from theoretical networks, and was corroborated by our empirical networks which were derived from 41 small- to medium-sized groups of 15 primate species. These results have potential implications for the understanding of social flexibility and its link with network performance, in addition informing many interdisciplinary fields, such as communication and computer science.

AB  - Social organisms are especially vulnerable to pathogens due to the homogeneity of the colony, and the close proximity and extensive interactions among its members. However, the social organization of these groups also offers the potential to provide an effective barrier against the transmission of pathogens within the colony. Social insects with their elaborate colony organizations provide an ideal model system to develop and test this hypothesis. While the different elements of colony organization are generally assumed to be products of ergonomic selection, in this paper we address how the same elements could influence the transmission of pathogens. By developing a simple model, we explore how three parameters of colony organization, division of labor, interaction network and colony demography could influence the transmission of pathogens. We find that heterogeneity among individuals in terms of division of labor alone has little effect on the spread of an infection in the colony and the scenario is indistinguishable from one in which all the individuals are homogeneous. However, division of labor, combined with heterogeneity in the interaction network and demographic schedules reduce the spread of an infection. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - 1. In this review, we first summarize how hydrologic connectivity has been studied for riverine fish capable of moving long distances, and then identify research opportunities that have clear conservation significance. Migratory species, such as anadromous salmonids, are good model organisms for understanding ecological connectivity in rivers because the spatial scale over which movements occur among freshwater habitats is large enough to be easily observed with available techniques; they are often economically or culturally valuable with habitats that can be easily fragmented by human activities; and they integrate landscape conditions from multiple surrounding catchment(s) with in-river conditions. Studies have focussed on three themes: (i) relatively stable connections (connections controlled by processes that act over broad spatio-temporal scales >1000 km<sup>2</sup> and >100 years); (ii) dynamic connections (connections controlled by processes acting over fine to moderate spatio-temporal scales ∼1-1000 km<sup>2</sup> and <1-100 years); and (iii) anthropogenic influences on hydrologic connectivity, including actions that disrupt or enhance natural connections experienced by fish. 2. We outline eight challenges to understanding the role of connectivity in riverine fish ecology, organized under three foci: (i) addressing the constraints of river structure; (ii) embracing temporal complexity in hydrologic connectivity; and (iii) managing connectivity for riverine fishes. Challenges include the spatial structure of stream networks, the force and direction of flow, scale-dependence of connectivity, shifting boundaries, complexity of behaviour and life histories and quantifying anthropogenic influence on connectivity and aligning management goals. As we discuss each challenge, we summarize relevant approaches in the literature and provide additional suggestions for improving research and management of connectivity for riverine fishes. 3. Specifically, we suggest that rapid advances are possible in the following arenas: (i) incorporating network structure and river discharge into analyses; (ii) increasing explicit consideration of temporal complexity and fish behaviour in the scope of analyses; and (iii) parsing degrees of human and natural influences on connectivity and defining acceptable alterations. Multiscale analyses are most likely to identify dominant patterns of connections and disconnections, and the appropriate scale at which to focus conservation activities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - New management strategies for detecting social instabilities and promoting social cohesion are needed to reduce aggression-based morbidity and mortality among captive groups of rhesus macaques. This study was conducted to determine the utility of social network analysis for deciphering patterns of aggression and wounding in rhesus macaques. Over 37,000 observations of affiliative, submissive and aggressive activities were collected over a 3-year period on approx. 1300 rhesus macaques housed in 13.2ha enclosures. Data also were analyzed on management factors such as age/sex composition and matriline configuration that might promote or reduce aggression in rhesus macaques. Results suggest that social network measures such as subordination degree (social power), displacement fragmentation and groom reciprocity within social groups were not only significantly associated with rates of contact aggression and wounding but with the occurrence of severe aggressive outbreaks, known as cage wars. In addition, groups with a lower proportion of adult females and a more uniform distribution in the number of individuals across matrilines exhibited higher social power and lower fragmentation. These data indicate that by manipulating group composition and matriline configuration of social groups to promote social cohesion and stability, behavioral managers may be able to reduce the level of aggression and aggression-based morbidity and mortality. These data also show that social network measures are valuable predictors of deleterious aggression and even cage wars indicating that such measures could be used to longitudinally track changes in social dynamics to detect significant instabilities, allowing managers to prevent severe outbreaks before they occur in populations of rhesus macaques and perhaps other non-human primate species.

AB  - Pathogen transmission in animal populations is contingent on interactions between and within species. Often standard ornithological data (e.g. total counts at a wetland) are the only data available for assessing the risks of avian pathogen transmission. In this paper we ask whether these data can be used to infer fine-scale transmission patterns. We tested for non-randomness in waterbird assemblages and explored waterbird interactions using social network analysis. Certain network parameter values were then compared to a data set on avian influenza prevalence in southern Africa. Our results showed that species associations were strongly non-random, implying that most standard ornithological data sets would not provide adequate information on which to base models of pathogen spread. In both aquatic and terrestrial networks, all species regularly associated closely with other network members. The spread of pathogens through the community could thus be rapid. Network analysis together with detailed, fine-scale observations offers a promising avenue for further research and management-oriented applications. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Infectious processes in a social group are driven by a network of contacts that is generally structured by the organization arising from behavioral and spatial heterogeneities within the group. Although theoretical models of transmission dynamics have placed an overwhelming emphasis on the importance of understanding the network structure in a social group, empirical data regarding such contact structures are rare. In this paper, I analyze the network structure and the correlated transmission dynamics within a honeybee colony as determined by food transfer interactions and the changes produced in it by an experimental manipulation. The study demonstrates that widespread transmission in the colony is correlated to a lower clustering coefficient and higher robustness of the social network. I also show that the social network in the colony is determined by the spatial distribution of various age classes, and the resulting organizational structure provides some amount of immunity to the young individuals. The results of this study demonstrates how, using the honeybee colony as a model system, concepts in network theory can be combined with those in behavioral ecology to gain a better understanding of social transmission processes, especially those related to disease dynamics.

AB  - Primates are notable for the widespread presence of long-term female-male associations which go beyond the mating context. However, little attention has been given to the factors that affect within-species variation in female-male relationships, especially among New World primates. Although detailed accounts of heterosexual relationships in Cebus species are scarce, a few studies have suggested the occurrence of strong associations between adult females and high-ranking males. This study explores affiliative relationships between females and the alpha male during the nonbreeding season in wild tufted capuchin monkeys ( Cebus apella nigritus). Affiliative relationships were explored through female-male patterns of spatial proximity and grooming. By adopting a social network approach, we analyzed: (1) whether the alpha male is the preferred male partner for females and, (2) whether variation (if any) in female-alpha male affiliation can be explained through both female individual characteristics and social network metrics. Our results showed that alpha males were the favorite male partner for adult females in the proximity networks, but this did not hold true in the grooming networks. In addition, female-alpha male interaction patterns showed considerable variation, with only some females being strongly associated with the alpha male. Our results suggest that such a variation can be explained by female dominance rank, level of centrality (the quantity and intensity of spatial connection with other females) and prestige (the quantity of grooming received by other females) in female-female social networks. Taken together, these findings highlight two aspects of female-alpha male relationships in tufted capuchin monkeys: the alpha male represents the most socially integrated male in the group, and females with high dominance ranks and high centrality in both proximity and grooming networks show stronger relationships with the alpha male.

AB  - Abstract: Social animals with greater access to social support, i.e. higher levels of social capital, may be able to cope better with the challenges they face in their day-to-day lives, and this may be reflected in lower physiological stress levels. Here, we examine the relationship between social capital and fecal glucocorticoid (GC) levels in pregnant free-ranging adult female rhesus macaques. In addition to social capital measures based on direct connections between social partners, which have been examined previously, we use social network analysis to generate measures of social capital based on indirect connections (i.e. connections between pairs of individuals which result from their mutual direct connection to a third party). We consider social capital based on three different types of affiliative association: grooming, the exchange of affiliative vocalizations and proximity. After controlling for variables known to affect GC output in primates (e.g. month of pregnancy), GC levels of females were significantly predicted by a social network measure of indirect connectedness in the proximity network, proximity reach, in interaction with dominance rank. High ranking females had significantly lower GC levels in months in which they had low levels of proximity reach (i.e. in months in which their proximity networks were smaller and therefore more focused). The results of our study add to a growing body of evidence which suggests that social capital may be an important means by which gregarious animals cope with day-to-day challenges. Our study also joins a small body of recent research which has demonstrated that indirect connections may be important factors in the lives of social animals. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Summary 1. Drought is a natural disturbance of aquatic ecosystems and can be a major factor in structuring aquatic communities. For individuals, populations and communities to persist in disturbed environments, they must have refuge from disturbance or disturbance must be minimal. Refugia convey spatial and temporal resistance or resilience in the face of disturbance, but the role of refugia in aquatic systems remains poorly understood. 2. We review available literature on aquatic refugia for fishes in order to synthesise current knowledge and provide suggestions for needed research. Our objectives were to clarify definitions of disturbance and refugia in the context of drought in aquatic systems, review how refuge habitats influence fish community structure, and consider the potential impact of refugia on fish population and community dynamics during drought. 3. Droughts cause a decrease in surface area/volume and an increase in extremes of physical and chemical water quality parameters. These conditions are linked with biotic interactions that structure the community of fishes residing in low-flow or dry season refugia by increasing mortality rates, decreasing birth rates and/or increasing migration rates. Many aquatic organisms seek refuge from disturbance and/or have adaptations (e.g. physiological tolerance) that provide refuge. 4. Drought in aquatic systems leads to shifts in refugia spacing and connectance at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Refuge size, disturbance intensity, and mobility of organisms is predicted to play a large role in population persistence. We expect that refuge habitats will experience net immigration during drying and net emigration after rewetting, with the opposite occurring in surrounding habitat patches. Population dynamics of fishes using refugia during drought are best modelled by modified source-sink dynamics, but dynamics are likely to change with spatial scale. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The evolution and origin of primate social organisation has attracted the attention of many researchers, and a solitary pattern, believed to be present in most nocturnal prosimians, has been generally considered as the most primitive system. Nocturnal prosimians are in fact mostly seen alone during their nightly activities and therefore termed 'solitary foragers', but that does not mean that they are not social. Moreover, designating their social organisation as 'solitary', implies that their way of life is uniform in all species. It has, however, emerged over the last decades that all of them exhibit not only some kind of social network but also that those networks differ among species. There is a need to classify these social networks in the same manner as with group-living (gregarious) animals if we wish to link up the different forms of primate social organisation with ecological, morphological or phylogenetic variables. In this review, the authors establish a basic classification based on spatial relations and sociality in order to describe and cope properly with the social organisation patterns of the different species of nocturnal prosimians and other mammals that do not forage in cohesive groups. In attempting to trace the ancestral patterns of primate social organisation, the Malagasy mouse and dwarf lemurs and the Afro-Asian bushbabies and lorises are of special interest because they are thought to approach the ancestral conditions most closely. These species have generally been believed to exhibit a dispersed harem system as their pattern of social organisation ('dispersed' means that individuals forage solitarily but exhibit a social network). Therefore, the ancestral pattern of primate social organisation was inferred to be a dispersed harem. In fact, new field data on cheirogaleids combined with a review of patterns of social organisation in strepsirhines (lemurs, bushbabies, and lorises) revealed that they exhibit either dispersed multi-male systems or dispersed monogamy rather than a dispersed harem system. Therefore, the concept of a dispersed harem system as the ancestral condition of primate social organisation can no longer be supported. In combination with data on social organisation patterns in 'primitive' placentals and marsupials, and in monotremes, it is in fact most probable that promiscuity is the ancestral pattern for mammalian social organisation. Subsequently, a dispersed multi-male system derived from promiscuity should be regarded as the ancestral condition for primates. The authors further suggest that the gregarious patterns of social organisation in Aotus and Avahi, and the dispersed form in Tarsius evolved from the gregarious patterns of diurnal primates rather from the dispersed nocturnal type. It is consequently proposed that, in addition to Aotus and Tarsius, Avahi is also secondarily nocturnal (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - It has been suggested that variation in brain structure correlates with the sizes of individuals' social networks. Whether variation in social network size causes variation in brain structure, however, is unknown. To address this question, we neuroimaged 23 monkeys that had been living in social groups set to different sizes. Subject comparison revealed that living in larger groups caused increases in gray matter in mid-superior temporal sulcus and rostral prefrontal cortex and increased coupling of activity in frontal and temporal cortex. Social network size, therefore, contributes to changes both in brain structure and function. The changes have potential implications for an animal's success in a social context; gray matter differences in similar areas were also correlated with each animal's dominance within its social network.

AB  - Throughout the developing world, urban centres with sprawling slum settlements are rapidly expanding and invading previously forested ecosystems. Slum communities are characterized by untended refuse, open sewers and overgrown vegetation, which promote rodent infestation. Norway rats ( Rattus norvegicus) are reservoirs for epidemic transmission of many zoonotic pathogens of public health importance. Understanding the population ecology of R. norvegicus is essential to formulate effective rodent control strategies, as this knowledge aids estimation of the temporal stability and spatial connectivity of populations. We screened for genetic variation, characterized the population genetic structure and evaluated the extent and patterns of gene flow in the urban landscape using 17 microsatellite loci in 146 rats from nine sites in the city of Salvador, Brazil. These sites were divided between three neighbourhoods within the city spaced an average of 2.7 km apart. Surprisingly, we detected very little relatedness among animals trapped at the same site and found high levels of genetic diversity, as well as structuring across small geographical distances. Most F<sub>ST</sub> comparisons among sites were statistically significant, including sites <400 m apart. Bayesian analyses grouped the samples in three genetic clusters, each associated with distinct sampling sites from different neighbourhoods or valleys within neighbourhoods. These data indicate the existence of complex genetic structure in R. norvegicus in Salvador, linked to the heterogeneous urban landscape. Future rodent control measures need to take into account the spatial and temporal linkage of rat populations in Salvador, as revealed by genetic data, to develop informed eradication strategies.

AB  - Stochastic and catastrophic events may strongly impact the dynamics of wild populations. Annual fluctuations in rainfall may affect parrot populations, but few studies address the impact of other stochastic or catastrophic events on their population dynamics. The Maroon-fronted Parrot Rhynchopsitta terrisi is an endangered species that nests colonially in cavities and crevices in limestone cliffs. From 1995 to 2010, we quantified Parrot attendance at nesting colonies throughout its breeding range, and reproductive output of nesting Parrots from 1997 to 2010 at the two most important nesting colonies. There was significant variation among colonies in the number of cavities occupied by Parrots each year. Rainfall significantly influenced both the number of occupied cavities and productivity, which declined after very dry years. Natural unpredictable events such as hurricanes did not modify the nesting activity of Maroon-fronted Parrots at breeding colonies. However, wildfires increased in dry years, negatively affecting attendance at breeding colonies. The Maroon-fronted Parrot may overcome the impacts of climatic variability, natural stochastic processes, and human-induced catastrophic events by using nesting colonies as a network of resources throughout the breeding range. Given the current trends in climate change, it is likely the species may suffer stronger and more frequent unpredictable catastrophic events, potentially putting at risk its survival in the long term.

AB  - Temporal variation in the direct and indirect influence that hosts and parasites exert on each other is still poorly understood. However, variation in species' influence due to species and interactions turnover can have important consequences for host community dynamics and/or for parasite transmission dynamics, and eventually for the risk of zoonotic diseases., We used data on a network of small mammals and their ectoparasites surveyed over 6 years to test hypotheses exploring (i) the temporal variability in direct and indirect influences species exert on each other in a community, and (ii) the differences in temporal variability of direct/indirect influences between temporally persistent (TP) and temporally intermittent species., We modelled the temporal variation in (i) direct reciprocal influence between hosts and parasites (hosts providing resources to parasites and parasites exploiting the resources of hosts), using an asymmetry index, and (ii) indirect influence among species within a community (e.g. facilitation of parasite infestation by other parasites), using betweenness centrality. We also correlated asymmetry and centrality to examine the relationship between them., Network dynamics was determined by TP species but even those species had strong among-species heterogeneity in the temporal variation of the direct/indirect effects they exerted. In addition, there was a significant positive linear correlation between asymmetry and centrality., We conclude that the temporal dynamics of host-parasite interactions is driven by TP hosts. However, even within this group of persistent species, some exhibit large temporal variation, such that the functional roles they play (e.g. in promoting parasite transmission) change over time. In addition, parasites having a large negative impact on hosts are also those facilitating the spread of other parasites through the entire host community. Our results provide new insights into community dynamics and can be applied in the management of antagonistic networks aimed at preventing disease outbreaks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Because the nature, tempo and trajectories of biological changes that follow the cessation of trawling are unknown for seamounts, it is unclear whether closing them to trawling will lead to a recovery of the fauna and, if so, over what time scales. This paper reports on a ‘test of recovery’ from repeated towed camera surveys on three seamounts off New Zealand in 2001 and 2006 (5 years apart) and three off Australia in 1997 and 2006 (10 years apart). In each region, seamounts where trawling had ceased were compared to adjacent seamounts where trawling was still active, and to seamounts that had never been trawled. If recovery signals existed, the likelihood of detecting them was high because the seamounts were relatively small and topographically simple, and because quantitative survey methods were employed. Multivariate patterns showed no change in the megafaunal assemblage consistent with recovery over a 5–10 year timeframe on seamounts where trawling had ceased. Results based on the number of species and diversity were equivocal, with some cases of increase and decrease on seamounts where trawling had ceased. A few individual taxa were found at significantly higher abundance in the later surveys where trawling had occurred. We suggest this may have resulted from their resistance to the direct impacts of trawling (two chrysogorgid corals and solitary scleractinians), or from protection in natural refuges inaccessible to trawls (unstalked crinoids, two chrysogorgid corals, gorgonians, and urchins). Alternatively, these taxa may represent the earliest stages of seamount recolonisation. They have potential to be dominant for long periods because the pre-trawling composition of benthic assemblages on seamounts includes taxa that grow slowly and/or have an association with ‘thickets’ of a single keystone stony coral ( Solenosmilia variabilis) that has generated biogenic habitat over millennia. Resilience of seamount ecosystems dominated by corals is low compared to most other marine systems subject to disturbance by bottom trawling because there are no alternative habitats of the same value for supporting associated species, and because trawling typically removes coral habitat from large areas of individual seamounts. Management to conserve seamount ecosystems needs to account for changing oceanographic conditions (ocean acidification), as well as the direct impacts of human activities such as bottom trawling. Networks of spatial closures that include intact habitats over a range of depths, especially <1500 m, and on clusters and isolated seamounts, may be effective by maintaining the resilience of seamount benthic communities.

AB  - Much work has been done to further our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie the diversity of primate social organizations, but none has addressed the limits to that diversity or the question of what causes species to either form or not form social networks. The fact that all living primates typically live in social networks makes it highly likely that the last common ancestor of living primates already lived in social networks, and that sociality formed an integral part of the adaptive nature of primate origins. A characterization of primate sociality within the wider mammalian context is therefore essential to further our understanding of the adaptive nature of primate origins. Here we determine correlates of sociality and nonsociality in rodents as a model to infer causes of sociality in primates. We found sociality to be most strongly associated with large-bodied arboreal species that include a significant portion of fruit in their diet. Fruits and other plant products, such as flowers, seeds, and young leaves, are patchily distributed in time and space and are therefore difficult to find. These food resources are, however, predictable and dependable when their location is known. Hence, membership in a social unit can maximize food exploitation if information on feeding sites is shared. Whether sociality evolved in the primate stem lineage or whether it was already present earlier in the evolution of Euarchontoglires remains uncertain, although tentative evidence points to the former scenario. In either case, frugivory is likely to have played an important role in maintaining the presence of a social lifestyle throughout primate evolution. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Our current understanding of animal social networks is largely based on observations or experiments that do not directly manipulate associations between individuals. Consequently, evidence relating to the causal processes underlying such networks is limited. By imposing specified rules controlling individual access to feeding stations, we directly manipulated the foraging social network of a wild bird community, thus demonstrating how external factors can shape social structure. We show that experimentally imposed constraints were carried over into patterns of association at unrestricted, ephemeral food patches, as well as at nesting sites during breeding territory prospecting. Hence, different social contexts can be causally linked, and constraints at one level may have consequences that extend into other aspects of sociality. Finally, the imposed assortment was lost following the cessation of the experimental manipulation, indicating the potential for previously perturbed social networks of wild animals to recover from segregation driven by external constraints.

AB  - [unedited] About 190,000 ha of higher-elevation marl prairies flank either side of Shark River Slough in the southern Everglades. Water levels typically drop below the ground surface each year in this landscape. Consequently, peat soil accretion is inhibited, and substrates consist either of calcitic marl produced by algal periphyton mats or exposed limestone bedrock. The southern marl prairies support complex mosaics of wet prairie, sawgrass sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), tree islands, and tropical hammock communities and a high diversity of plant species. However, relatively short hydroperiods and annual dry downs provide stressful conditions for aquatic fauna, affecting survival in the dry season when surface water is absent. Here, we present a conceptual ecological model developed for this landscape through scientific concensus, use of empirical data, and modeling. The two major societal drivers affecting the southern marl prairies are water management practices and agricultural and urban development. These drivers lead to five groups of ecosystem stressors: loss of spatial extent and connectivity, shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity, extended hydroperiod and drying pattern reversals, introduction and spread of non-native trees, and introduction and spread of non-native fishes. Major ecological attributes include periphyton mats, plant species diversity and community mosaic, Cape Sable seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis), marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna prey base, American alligator (Alligator missssippiensis), and wading bird early dry season foraging. Water management and development are hypothesized to have a negative effect on the ecological attributes of the southern marl prairies in the following ways. Periphyton mats have decreased in cover in areas where hydroperiod has been significantly reduced and changed in community composition due to inverse responses to increased nutrient availability. Plant species diversity and community mosaics have changed due to shifting gradients to more terrestrial or more aquatic communities, displacement of native communities by non-natives, expansion of woody plants, high-intensity dry season fires, tree-island burnout, and reduced microtopography resulting from alligator population decline. Cape Sable seaside sparrow populations are threatened by nest destruction resulting from extended hydroperiods, drying pattern reversals, and high intensity dry season fires, as well as by the expansion of woody plants into graminoid wetland habitats. Populations of marsh fishes and associated aquatic fauna that constitute the aquatic prey base for higher vertebrates have decreased in density and changed in species composition and size structure due to loss of wetland spatial extent, shortened hydroperiod, increased drought severity, loss of aquatic drought refugia in solution holes and alligator holes, and spread of exotic fishes. American alligator populations have declined in the Rocky Glades, and alligator holes have filled with sediment, as a result of shortened hydroperiod and increased drought severity. Habitat options for wading birds to forage during the early dry season and during unusually wet years have been reduced due to loss of spatial extent and shortened hydroperiod (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - Abstract: Recent studies have shown that social networks and their properties are key in the search for explanations for the success in the governance and management of natural resources. We investigated the structure and properties of inter-organizational social networks involved in the use and management of natural resources in a coastal marine ecosystem in northern Chile proposed as a possible marine protected area. We explored two network configurations: i) relations of collaboration and ii) relations of transfer and exchange of scientific knowledge and information useful to the management of natural resources and the decision-making process involved. Both networks showed little cohesion, with low values of centralization and density indicating a low flow of collaborative and exchange relations among different stakeholders. The knowledge network achieved greater levels of centralization than the collaboration network. National government agencies and fishermen organizations were the most powerful stakeholders in the collaboration network. National government agencies and universities were the most powerful stakeholders in the knowledge network. We found a disconnected network when analyzing the flows of collaboration and knowledge between different administrative operation levels that potentially would hamper the governance of this area. On the other hand, we identified stakeholders that would help to connect the network (bridging stakeholders). Additional analysis of stakeholders using influence-capacity matrix allowed us to identify key stakeholders for planning and implementing the new marine protected area, compare results with the network analysis, and propose network interventions. We propose combining Social Network Analysis with other methods of stakeholder analysis to produce more practical and implementable results. Our results are relevant for future interventions aimed at improving or implementing management and governance of coastal areas. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - ABSTRACT Aquatic ecologists are working to develop theory and techniques for analysis of dynamic stream processes and communities of organisms. Such work is critical for the development of conservation plans that are relevant at the scale of entire ecosystems. The stream network is the foundation upon which stream systems are organized. Natural and human disturbances in streams alter the configuration of stream habitats such as pools, riffles, and glides across seasons, decades, or centuries. Thus, native aquatic species have developed mechanisms for adapting to the dynamic configuration of habitats in stream networks., At different spatial scales, stream network structure informs habitat connectivity for aquatic-obligate species. The movement of aquatic species both upstream and downstream is limited by stream channels and may be modified by the downstream flow of water, nutrients, and physical materials such as wood and substrate. Analysing streams as networks offers a realistic and holistic perspective for assessing movement and distribution by freshwater aquatic species in response to life-history needs and environmental conditions., In this study, network analysis was facilitated by automating, in a Geographic Information System, the calculation of network distances and variables that represent spatial configuration. A comparison between traditional instream habitat variables and network variables for juvenile coho salmon ( Oncorhynchus kisutch) in seven sub-basins of Oregon's mid-coast over a 5-year period revealed that network variables perform better at explaining juvenile coho salmon density than instream habitat variables. Moreover, analysis of network distances among seasonal habitats indicates that juvenile coho salmon density may be higher where the distance between critical seasonal habitats is short. This work furthers aquatic conservation, management, and restoration by including analysis of the proximity and connectivity among aquatic freshwater habitats. Published in 2012. This article is a US Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social interactions are critical to the organization of worker activities in insect colonies and their consequent ecological success. The structure of this interaction network is therefore crucial to our understanding of colony organization and functioning. In this paper, I study the properties of the interaction network in the colonies of the social wasp Ropalidia marginata. I find that the network is characterized by a uniform connectivity among individuals with increasing heterogeneity as colonies become larger. Important network parameters are found to be correlated with colony size and I investigate how this is reflected in the organization of work in colonies of different sizes. Finally, I test the resilience of these interaction networks by experimental removal of individuals from the colony and discuss the structural properties of the network that are related to resilience in a social network.

AB  - Several lines of evidence support genetic links between ovary size and division of labor in worker honey bees. However, it is largely unknown how ovaries influence behavior. To address this question, we first performed transcriptional profiling on worker ovaries from two genotypes that differ in social behavior and ovary size. Then, we contrasted the differentially expressed ovarian genes with six sets of available brain transcriptomes. Finally, we probed behavior-related candidate gene networks in wild-type ovaries of different sizes. We found differential expression in 2151 ovarian transcripts in these artificially selected honey bee strains, corresponding to approximately 20.3% of the predicted gene set of honey bees. Differences in gene expression overlapped significantly with changes in the brain transcriptomes. Differentially expressed genes were associated with neural signal transmission (tyramine receptor, TYR) and ecdysteroid signaling; two independently tested nuclear hormone receptors (HR46 and ftz-f1) were also significantly correlated with ovary size in wild-type bees. We suggest that the correspondence between ovary and brain transcriptomes identified here indicates systemic regulatory networks among hormones (juvenile hormone and ecdysteroids), pheromones (queen mandibular pheromone), reproductive organs and nervous tissues in worker honey bees. Furthermore, robust correlations between ovary size and neuraland endocrine response genes are consistent with the hypothesized roles of the ovaries in honey bee behavioral regulation.

AB  - Mutualisms often form networks of interacting species, characterized by the existence of a central core of species that potentially drive the ecology and the evolution of the whole community. Centrality measures allow quantification of how central or peripheral a species is within a network, thus informing about the role of each species in network organization, dynamics, and stability. In the present study we addressed the question whether the structural position of species in the network (i.e. their topological importance) relates to their ecological traits. We studied interactions between cleaner and client reef fishes to identify central and peripheral species within a mutualistic network, and investigated five ecological correlates. We used three measures to estimate the level of centrality of a species for distinct structural patterns, such as the number of interactions and the structural proximity to other species. Through the use of a principal component analysis (PCA) we observed that the centrality measures were highly correlated (92.5%) in the studied network, which indicates that the same species plays a similar role for the different structural patterns. Three cleaner and ten client species had positive values of centrality, which suggests that these species are modulating ecological and evolutionary dynamics within the network. Higher centralities were related to higher abundances and feeding habits for client fishes, but not for cleaners. The high correlation between centrality measures in the present study is likely related to the nested structure of the cleaning network. The cleaner species’ set, by having central species that are not necessarily the most abundant ones, bears potentially more vulnerable points for network cohesiveness. Additionally, the present study generalizes previous findings for plant–animal mutualisms, as it shows that the structure of marine mutualisms is also related to a complex interplay between abundance and niche-related features.

AB  - Addressing spatial connectivity in conservation planning is important to ensure the maintenance of patterns and processes needed to support the persistence of biodiversity. In freshwater ecosystems, spatial connectivity is constrained by the presence of water, which exhibits marked temporal changes in regions with wet-dry seasonal climates. Previous studies have focused on spatial connectivity and overlooked the temporal component, which is required for the functionality of spatial connections (because of temporal changes in water availability)., We identify priority areas for the conservation of freshwater fish, waterbirds and turtles in the Mitchell River catchment in the wet-dry tropics of northern Australia. We demonstrate how adequacy of freshwater conservation can be enhanced by integrating an estimate of water residency time ( WRT) into the prioritization process. WRT reflects refugial potential and connectivity in freshwater ecosystems and was quantified using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ( MODIS) flood and post-flood Landsat satellite imagery. We compare the spatial allocation of priority areas and the spatial and temporal connectivity under two alternative scenarios: (i) accounting only for spatial connectivity and (ii) integrating spatial and temporal connectivity., Priority areas identified under the spatial and temporal connectivity scenario showed a 40% increase in WRT values with respect to the traditional spatial connectivity scenario. This was achieved at no additional cost in terms of total protected area and maintaining the same spatial connectivity., Despite priority areas identified under the two alternative scenarios showing intermediate spatial overlap (64%), the selection process was more efficiently biased towards planning units with high WRT values. WRT in planning units that were only selected under the temporal connectivity scenario was 2·5 times higher than in planning units that only appeared in the traditional connectivity scenario. This reveals the importance of accounting for WRT when identifying freshwater priority areas in wet-dry seasonal environments., Synthesis and applications: Considering the temporal connectivity in conservation prioritization as we propose here helps to assess periods of longest spatial connections, thereby maximizing the refugial role of freshwater priority areas during dry periods. Using publicly available satellite imagery data and software, our approach allows improved management of aquatic resources and biodiversity during periods of water scarcity, which may increase in incidence and duration with climate change.

AB  - Participatory environmental and resource management is premised on open communication to reach consensus. However, deliberate and open communication cannot adequately address silent conflict. This begs two questions. First, how is the existence of covert communication and silent conflict to be recognized and addressed? Second, how are the wider social relations and traditions that encompass communication and conflict to be described and explained? These questions revolve around communicative power. Communication of environmental knowledge is deeply embedded in social power structures, with direct implications for participatory resource planning and implementation. Ethnographic research conducted at a failed community-managed fish farming project in Southeast Sulawesi, Indonesia shows that a culture of harmony and respect for authority can silence environmental conflict in the hierarchical “community.” Three propositions are offered. First, communication amnesia and exclusion jeopardize participation. Second, cultures of harmony and silent conflict shape planning processes and outcomes. Third, the weak use manipulation and communication strategy to acquire a “voice” while preserving harmony. These propositions address five unresolved issues in participatory resource management: analysis of groups, contextuality, social relationships, nonparticipants, and informal communication. Power, tradition, and social networks affect the valuing of knowledge relative to the power of different individuals and institutions to communicate priorities, values, and needs. These factors are critical to the inclusion of both participants and nonparticipants. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The application of network theory within the field of ecology has predominantly been based around the examination of species interactions (e.g. food webs). Extension of networks to spatial ecology is currently limited, yet the approach has significant potential as a framework for analysing habitat connectivity and ecosystem stability. Examination of network structures characterizing the spatial dynamics of organisms has the potential to highlight the relative robustness or vulnerability of the ecosystem processes they support., On coral reefs, grazing by large herbivorous fishes is critical in maintaining the balance between coral and algae and is widely recognized as a key process in reef ecosystem functioning. However, the spatial dynamics exhibited by roving herbivores, and the implications of these dynamics for the overall stability and resilience of herbivory on reefs are not well understood., Here, we present a novel extension of network theory to the analysis of movements of marine herbivorous fishes within a reef system. Using an array of remote acoustic receivers, over a period of 12 months, we tracked the movements of fishes belonging to the three dominant species of roving herbivore within a particular coral reef community., Analysing these movements in terms of network graph theory, we found that individual fishes clustered their activities within small sections of the available linear reef habitat, and movements within and outside of these home ranges were made along predictable routes. All three species were heavily reliant on particular, well-connected parts of the reef (nodes), mirroring an 'ultra-small-world' network. This underlying dynamic creates vulnerability in the system, making targeted removal by fishing or the degradation of individual pockets of reef habitat more likely to result in a complete collapse in the overall process of herbivory at that particular area of reef., Our results highlight an inherent vulnerability in the movement dynamics of herbivorous fishes and, by extension, in the overall process of herbivory in reef ecosystems. They suggest that maintaining high herbivore abundances across all reef habitats is critical in preserving the integrity of the grazing function on reefs. The approach of using network graph theory to analyse acoustic telemetry data is illuminating and is likely to have a range of applications across diverse ecosystems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Conservation of long‐distance migratory species poses unique challenges. Migratory connectivity, that is, the extent to which groupings of individuals at breeding sites are maintained in wintering areas, is frequently used to evaluate population structure and assess use of key habitat areas. However, for species with complex or variable annual cycle movements, this traditional bimodal framework of migratory connectivity may be overly simplistic. Like many other waterfowl, sea ducks often travel to specific pre‐ and post‐breeding sites outside their nesting and wintering areas to prepare for migration by feeding extensively and, in some cases, molting their flight feathers. These additional migrations may play a key role in population structure, but are not included in traditional models of migratory connectivity. Network analysis, which applies graph theory to assess linkages between discrete locations or entities, offers a powerful tool for quantitatively assessing the contributions of different sites used throughout the annual cycle to complex spatial networks. We collected satellite telemetry data on annual cycle movements of 672 individual sea ducks of five species from throughout eastern North America and the Great Lakes. From these data, we constructed a multi‐species network model of migratory patterns and site use over the course of breeding, molting, wintering, and migratory staging. Our results highlight inter‐ and intra‐specific differences in the patterns and complexity of annual cycle movement patterns, including the central importance of staging and molting sites in James Bay, the St. Lawrence River, and southern New England to multi‐species annual cycle habitat linkages, and highlight the value of Long‐tailed Ducks (Calengula haemalis) as an umbrella species to represent the movement patterns of multiple sea duck species. We also discuss potential applications of network migration models to conservation prioritization, identification of population units, and integrating different data streams. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social stress is a population hypothesis that is invoked to explain the precipitous declines observed in population levels of such rodent species as Microtus pennsylvanicus. According to this hypothesis, stress is produced by the increase in aggressive contacts between animals in a growing population. Continued contacts produce profound hormonal and behavioral changes in these animals which lead to decreases in reproduction and viability. Several theoretical weaknesses of the hypothesis are raised. First, increases in density may not be positively correlated with the number of contacts. Animals may merely build more runways. Second, even if contacts do increase, they may not necessarily be aggressive in nature. Finally, confined populations which reach excessively high densities and for which contacts between animals must increase, fail to show a precipitous decline in numbers. In addition, a major methodological problem is revealed. Although researchers tend to causally connect social stress and precipitous population declines, most studies are correlational in nature. Of those studies that involve actual manipulations of populations, these manipulations are usually performed on confined populations that fail to exhibit the desired phenomonen. The difficulties associated with manipulating unconfined populations are discussed (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - Emergent infectious diseases represent a major threat for biodiversity in fragmented habitat networks, but their dynamics in host metapopulations remain largely unexplored. We studied a large community of pathogens (including 26 haematozoans, bacteria and viruses as determined through polymerase chain reaction assays) in a highly fragmented mainland bird metapopulation. Contrary to recent studies, which have established that the prevalence of pathogens increase with habitat fragmentation owing to crowding and habitat-edge effects, the analysed pathogen parameters were neither dependent on host densities nor related to the spatial structure of the metapopulation. We provide, to our knowledge, the first empirical evidence for a positive effect of host population size on pathogen prevalence, richness and diversity. These new insights into the interplay between habitat fragmentation and pathogens reveal properties of a host-pathogen system resembling island environments, suggesting that severe habitat loss and fragmentation could lower pathogen pressure in small populations.

AB  - Mitochondria form dynamic tubular networks that undergo frequent morphological changes through fission and fusion, the imbalance of which can affect cell survival in general and impact synaptic transmission and plasticity in neurons in particular. Some core components of the mitochondrial fission/fusion machinery, including the dynamin-like GTPases Drp1, Mitofusin, Opa1, and the Drp1-interacting protein Fis1, have been identified. How the fission and fusion processes are regulated under normal conditions and the extent to which defects in mitochondrial fission/fusion are involved in various disease conditions are poorly understood. Mitochondrial malfunction tends to cause diseases with brain and skeletal muscle manifestations and has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Whether abnormal mitochondrial fission or fusion plays a role in PD pathogenesis has not been shown. Here, we show that Pink1, a mitochondria-targeted Ser/Thr kinase linked to familial PD, genetically interacts with the mitochondrial fission/fusion machinery and modulates mitochondrial dynamics. Genetic manipulations that promote mitochondrial fission suppress Drosophila Pink 1 mutant phenotypes in indirect flight muscle and dopamine neurons, whereas decreased fission has opposite effects. In Drosophila and mammalian cells, overexpression of Pink1 promotes mitochondrial fission, whereas inhibition of Pink1 leads to excessive fusion. Our genetic interaction results suggest that Fis1 may act in-between Pink1 and Drp1 in controlling mitochondrial fission. These results reveal a cell biological role for Pink1 and establish mitochondrial fission/fusion as a paradigm for PD research. Compounds that modulate mitochondrial fission/fusion could have therapeutic value in PD intervention. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Connectivity is currently a central issue in landscape management and planning for the conservation of wildlife species occupying scarce habitat patches. In recent years, this issue has increasingly been addressed using methodologies based on spatial network analysis. Here, we propose a hybrid approach based on network analysis tools and empirical habitat suitability models to integrate connectivity on decision-making. The study is focused on a pond system used by the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis, in a coastal area in southwestern Iberia. The main objective of the study was to illustrate how the output of graph models may be useful to guide habitat management and planning. We assessed ponds according to three complementary structural and functional properties derived from a graph model: (1) pond importance as measured by the sensitivity of the overall connectivity to each pond loss, (2) pond coreness, used to identify the most cohesive pond subsystems and (3) pond betweenness, which measure the importance of ponds as stepping stones. The graph model took into account a resistance-to-movement surface, the maximum traveled distance and a habitat suitability model based on field sampling. Pond importance and coreness were shown to be positively related to occupancy, especially by turtle''s youngest age classes, suggesting an important contribution of connectivity attributes for turtle populations. We discuss the ways these pond connectivity-related attributes may be helpful to assist and optimize management efforts for the conservation of the European pond turtle in the study area.

AB  - During development, activity-dependent processes increase the specificity of neural responses to stimuli, but the role that this type of process plays in adult plasticity is unclear. We examined the dynamics of hippocampal activity as animals learned about new environments to understand how neural selectivity changes with experience. Hippocampal principal neurons fire when the animal is located in a particular subregion of its environment, and in any given environment the hippocampal representation is sparse: less than half of the neurons in areas CA1 and CA3 are active whereas the rest are essentially silent. Here we show that different dynamics govern the evolution of this sparsity in CA1 and upstream area CA3. CA1, but not CA3, produces twice as many spikes in novel compared with familiar environments. This high rate firing continues during sharp wave ripple events in a subsequent rest period. The overall CA1 population rate declines and the number of active cells decreases as the environment becomes familiar and task performance improves, but the decline in rate is not uniform across neurons. Instead, the activity of cells with initial peak spatial rates above ~12 Hz is enhanced, whereas the activity of cells with lower initial peak rates is suppressed. The result of these changes is that the active CA1 population comes to consist of a relatively small group of cells with strong spatial tuning. This process is not evident in CA3, indicating that a region-specific and long timescale process operates in CA1 to create a sparse, spatially informative population of neurons.

AB  - Increased habitat availability or quality can alter production of habitat- dependent organisms in two contrasting ways: (1) by enhancing input of new colonists to the new sites (the Field-of-Dreams Hypothesis); and (2) by drawing colonists away from existing sites (the Propagule Redirection Hypothesis), and thus reducing the deleterious effects of density. We conducted a field experiment on coral reef fishes in Moorea, French Polynesia, to quantify how differing levels of habitat availability (controlling for quality) increased and/or redirected colonizing larval fish. Focal reefs without neighboring reefs received two to four times more settlers than reefs with adjacent habitat, demonstrating that increased habitat redirected larval fish. At the scale of the entire reef array, total colonization increased 1.3-fold in response to a sixfold increase in reef area (and a 2.75-fold increase in adjusted habitat availability). Thus, propagules were both increased and redirected, a result midway between the Field-of-Dreams and Propagule Redirection Hypotheses. A recruitment model using our data and field estimates of density-dependent recruitment predicts that habitat addition increases recruitment primarily by ameliorating the negative effects of competition at existing sites rather than increasing colonization at the new sites per se. Understanding long-term implications of these effects depends upon the interplay among habitat dynamics, population connectivity, colonization dynamics, and density dependence.

AB  - Central and southern Manitoba contain some of the largest breeding populations of several colonial waterbird species in North America. Despite the value of this region for waterbirds, very little monitoring has been conducted on Lake Winnipeg, Lake Winnipegosis, or Lake Manitoba in the past three decades and little is known about the smaller boreal lakes in adjacent areas to the north. In June 2011, boat surveys were conducted on 11 boreal lakes in west-central Manitoba and east-central Saskatchewan to examine current abundance and distribution of colonial waterbirds in that region. Data from this survey were compared with abundance of colonial waterbirds on Lake Winnipegosis and Lake Manitoba from an aerial survey of these lakes in 2012. Water-bird colonies were located on 7 of the 11 lakes in 2011 and included Double-crested Cormorants {Phalacrocorax auritus) (2373 adults, 1134 pairs in 7 colonies), Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) (1367 adults, 772 pairs in 29 colonies), Forster's Terns (Sterna forsteri) (20 adults, 11 pairs in 1 colony), Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) (876 adults, 568 pairs in 23 colonies), and Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) (3752 adults, 16 colonies). Common Terns and Herring Gulls appeared to be predominantly breeders and pair abundance for both species increased in a sigmoidal fashion; lakes <100 km² in area had few breeding pairs. Numbers of Double-crested Cormorants and especially, Ring-billed Gulls, may have included a sizeable non-breeding component. Densities (pairs/lake area) of Common Terns and Herring Gulls were about 2 and 4 times higher, respectively, on these lakes than on Lake Winnipegosis and Lake Manitoba, while Double-crested Cormorant and Ring-billed Gull densities were higher on lakes Win-nipegosis and Manitoba. Additional studies of productivity in relation to lake characteristics and connectivity among colonies throughout the region would further our understanding of the importance and sustainability of waterbird populations in this region of the boreal forest.

AB  - Abstract: In the western Mediterranean region of Catalonia (NE Spain), during the last 20 years of the 20th century, the range of many forest bird species has expanded. Our objective was to characterize the roles of (a) spatial population processes (related to dispersal), (b) changes in forest structure (due to forest maturation and management), and (c) landscape composition (resulting from afforestation and fires) in the range expansion of these bird species at the landscape scale (10×10km). After correcting for the differences in sampling effort, colonizations appeared to be more likely near areas in which the species had been present in the 1980s. Patterns of the range expansion were also strongly associated with forest maturation, which seems to affect the spatial arrangement of birds at multiple scales. Changes in forest landscape composition due to afforestation and fires were minor determinants of range changes, and forest management did not seem to prevent range expansion at the spatial scale studied. Colonization events appeared to be driven primarily by landscape changes occurring in nearby localities rather than within the colonized locations themselves, presumably because of source–sink dynamics and connectivity patterns. Our results showed that in Catalonia, at a landscape scale, the impact of forest management on forest bird communities is much smaller than the impact of the widespread maturation of forests following a large-scale decline in traditional uses.

AB  - In social species, the structure and patterning of social interactions have implications for the opportunities for sexual interactions. We used social network analysis to explore the effect of habitat structural complexity on the social and sexual behaviour of male Trinidadian guppies. We used replicated seminatural pools in which we quantified male social network structure and reproductive behaviour under simple and complex habitats. In addition, we compared two populations of guppies that differed in their evolutionary history of predation (one high, one low). The level of habitat complexity did not significantly affect social network structure. However, social networks differed significantly between populations, which we suggest is due to differences in predator experience. Males from the high-predation population had greater overall social network differentiation and fewer male–male associations than their low-risk counterparts. Contrary to our prediction that males would associate more frequently with relatively large (more fecund) females, we observed a negative correlation between female size and the strength of male–female associations. We also found no effect of population or habitat complexity on either harassment or sexual network structures. There was, however, a significant interaction between habitat structure and population on the expression of reproductive strategies, with high-predation males expressing fewer sigmoid displays in the complex habitat and the opposite trend in low-predation males. We suggest this pattern is driven by population differences in male–male competition. We discuss our results in the context of the evolution of social structure and male reproductive strategies.

AB  - The quality and quantity of stream habitat can have profound impacts on the distribution and abundance of aquatic species. Stream networks, however, are dynamic in their response to natural- and human-induced disturbance regimes, which results in spatially explicit patterns of temporal variability. Quantifying spatial patterns in habitat (temporal) variability across different sites and identifying those factors associated with different levels of variability are important steps for stream habitat assessments. We evaluated the temporal variability in stream habitat over a 9-year period for 47headwater streams of the interior Columbia River basin. We used repeat-measures analyses to calculate temporal variability as root mean square error for six habitat attributes at each site. Multiple linear regression analyses with root mean square error as the response were then used to quantify which landscape, climate, and disturbance attributes were associated with different levels of temporal variability among habitat attributes. Our results indicated a considerable range of temporal variability in physical stream attributes across sites and an almost fourfold difference in the overall variability at sites. Landscape factors affecting stream power, land management activities, and recent fire regimes were all factors associated with the different levels of temporal variability across sites; surprisingly, we found little association with the different climatic attributes considered herein. The observed differences in temporal variability across sites suggest that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to monitoring stream habitat in response to restoration and management activities may be misleading, particularly in terms of sampling intensity, required resources, and statistical power; thus, in situ measures of temporal variability may be required for accurate assessments of statistical power.

AB  - Abstract: Disease is one of the single largest issues facing food animal agriculture today. Risk factors for various diseases in cattle, swine and chickens include aspects of both the physical and social environment. In this paper we review literature linking the social environment to illness in farm animals, drawing from a conceptual framework developed primarily in the human and laboratory animal literature. To date, researchers have identified various social determinants of disease, have linked social stressors to biological intermediaries and clinical signs of disease, and have established individual behavioural and neuroendocrine differences in susceptibility to disease. Further, ill animals reduce social behaviours as part of a suite of ‘sickness behaviours’. In animal agriculture, the social environment is controlled by management practices implemented on individual farms. Globally, farm sizes are growing, but there is no clear link between farm size and disease incidence. Rather, researchers have tied specific grouping practices, such as moving cows between groups, to increased disease risk, and have begun to determine the biological chain connecting the social world to biological determinants of disease. Studies with farm animals have also established individual variation in behavioural and neuroendocrine response to these practices. Some individuals are more reactive to changes in their social environment than others; however, there remains no consensus on how to recognize these at-risk animals. Additionally, despite the potential role in disease detection, little farm animal work has investigated whether a reduction in social behaviours could be used as early predictors of disease. We end the review by urging further farm animal research to determine the relationship between the social environment and disease, utilizing the concepts and methodologies that have been developed in the human and laboratory animal literature.

AB  - In socially living animals, individuals interact through complex networks of contact that may influence the spread of disease. Whereas traditional epidemiological models typically assume no social structure, network theory suggests that an individual’s location in the network determines its risk of infection. Empirical, especially experimental, studies of disease spread on networks are lacking, however, largely due to a shortage of amenable study systems. We used automated video-tracking to quantify networks of physical contact among individuals within colonies of the social bumble bee Bombus impatiens. We explored the effects of network structure on pathogen transmission in naturally and artificially infected hives. We show for the first time that contact network structure determines the spread of a contagious pathogen ( Crithidia bombi) in social insect colonies. Differences in rates of infection among colonies resulted largely from differences in network density among hives. Within colonies, a bee’s rate of contact with infected nestmates emerged as the only significant predictor of infection risk. The activity of bees, in terms of their movement rates and division of labour (e.g., brood care, nest care, foraging), did not influence risk of infection. Our results suggest that contact networks may have an important influence on the transmission of pathogens in social insects and, possibly, other social animals. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Social network analysis has become increasingly used to investigate the consequences of individuals’ social tendencies in recent years; however, the question of whether individuals are consistent in their social network position over time or situations has received comparatively scant attention. Knowledge of the degree to which individuals are stable in their social behavior can improve our understanding the fitness consequences of processes such as the transmission of disease and social information through networks, as well as the evolution of social behavior and social structure in general. Here, I investigated individual consistency in social behavior in wild vervet monkeys (<italic>Chlorocebus pygerthrus</italic>) residing in a highly seasonal habitat. I constructed grooming networks for three time periods characterized by diverse environmental conditions and explored the repeatability of seven network metrics as well as the effects of sex and dominance rank on these metrics. Both female and male vervets were highly consistent in three correlated, weighted measures of social connectedness—grooming in-strength, out-strength, and eigenvector centrality, and in-degree was moderately repeatable in both sexes. In contrast, only males were consistent in their out-degree and clustering coefficient, and there was no evidence of consistency in betweenness for either sex. High-ranking females had higher in-degree and in-strength scores, and high-ranking males had lower out-degree and out-strength, but controlling for dominance rank did not affect the findings regarding the repeatability of any metric. These results add to the small number of studies that have explored the temporal and situational stability of social network phenotypes in wild animals.Significance statement: Relatively few animal social network studies have examined whether individuals are consistent in the positions that they occupy within networks. Determining the degree to which individuals are consistent in their social network characteristics over time and across naturally changing conditions is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology and evolution of social behavior. In this study, I examined individual consistency in several components of social network position in vervet monkeys residing in a highly seasonal environment. I also evaluated the effects of sex and dominance rank on these measures of sociality. I found that both male and female vervets were consistent in most measures of direct connectedness in grooming networks across seasons, but metrics capturing indirect social connections were overall less repeatable. Controlling for the effects of dominance rank on sociality measures did not change these results. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - 1. Colonisation is a critical ecological process influencing both population and community level dynamics by connecting spatially discrete habitat patches. How communities respond to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances, furthermore, requires a basic understanding of how any environmental change modifies colonisation rates. For example, disturbance-induced shifts in the quantity of forest cover surrounding aquatic habitats have been associated with the distribution and abundance of numerous aquatic taxa. However, the mechanisms generating these broad and repeatable field patterns are unclear. 2. Such patterns of diversity could result from differential spatial mortality post colonisation, or from colonisation alone if species select sites non-randomly along canopy coverage gradients. We examined the colonisation/oviposition dynamics of aquatic beetles in experimental ponds placed under both open and closed forest canopies. 3. Canopy coverage imposed a substantial behavioural filter on the colonisation and reproduction of aquatic beetles representing multiple trophic levels, and resulted in significantly higher abundance, richness, and oviposition activity in open canopy ponds. These patterns strengthened overtime; although early in the experiment, the most abundant beetle had similar abundance in open and closed ponds. However, its abundance subsequently declined and then most other species heavily colonised open canopy ponds. 4. The primary response of many aquatic species to disturbances that generate canopy coverage gradients surrounding aquatic ecosystems is behavioural. The magnitude of the colonisation responses reported here rivals, if not exceeds, those produced by predators, suggesting that aquatic landscapes are behaviourally assessed and partitioned across multiple environmental gradients. The community level structure produced solely by selective colonisation, is predicted to strongly modify how patch area and isolation affect colonisation rates and the degree to which communities are linked by the flux of individuals and species.

AB  - Using a novel interpretation of dynamic networks, we analyse the network of livestock movements in Great Britain in order to determine the risk of a large epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). This network is exceptionally well characterized, as there are legal requirements that the date, source, destination and number of animals be recorded and held on central databases. We identify a percolation threshold in the structure of the livestock network, indicating that, while there is little possibility of a national epidemic of FMD in winter when the catastrophic 2001 epidemic began, there remains a risk in late summer or early autumn. These predictions are corroborated by a non-parametric simulation in which the movements of livestock in 2003 and 2004 are replayed as they occurred. Despite the risk, we show that the network displays small-world properties which can be exploited to target surveillance and control and drastically reduce this risk. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Patterns of group social structure are often linked to the competitive regime within a social unit and to the availability of kin. In line with this, many studies have shown that the dispersing sex, which is considered to have fewer kin around, is less social, while the philopatric sex has strong social bonds. Chimpanzees were considered to fit well into this scheme with highly social and competing philopatric males and generally asocial and solitary dispersing females. However, recent data suggest that chimpanzee females can indeed be highly social, even though they are unlikely to be related to each other. We studied female sociality in a long-term habituated group living in the Taï Forest, Côte d''Ivoire. Female social relationships as measured by association and grooming preferences were well differentiated and long lasting. Association (and to a lesser extent grooming) bonds were associated with reduced aggression between social partners. In addition, the competitive regime as indicated by group size had a strong effect on female social networks, which were more centralized and less clustered in smaller groups, suggesting that competition may play a major role in shaping female chimpanzee sociality. These findings suggest that strong social bonds can occur even in the absence of a strong network of kin relationships. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Social learning has been documented in a wide diversity of animals. In free-living animals, however, it has been difficult to discern whether animals learn socially by observing other group members or asocially by acquiring a new behaviour independently. We addressed this challenge by developing network-based diffusion analysis (NBDA), which analyses the spread of traits through animal groups and takes into account that social network structure directs social learning opportunities. NBDA fits agent-based models of social and asocial learning to the observed data using maximum-likelihood estimation. The underlying learning mechanism can then be identified using model selection based on the Akaike information criterion. We tested our method with artificially created learning data that are based on a real-world co-feeding network of macaques. NBDA is better able to discriminate between social and asocial learning in comparison with diffusion curve analysis, the main method that was previously applied in this context. NBDA thus offers a new, more reliable statistical test of learning mechanisms. In addition, it can be used to address a wide range of questions related to social learning, such as identifying behavioural strategies used by animals when deciding whom to copy.

AB  - Oxytocin (OT) modulates social behavior in primates and many other vertebrate species. Studies in non‐primate animals have demonstrated that, in addition to influencing activity within individual brain areas, OT influences functional connectivity across networks of areas involved in social behavior. Previously, we used fMRI to image brain function in human subjects during a dyadic social interaction task following administration of either intranasal oxytocin (INOT) or placebo, and analyzed the data with a standard general linear model. Here, we conduct an extensive re‐analysis of these data to explore how OT modulates functional connectivity across a neural network that animal studies implicate in social behavior. OT induced widespread increases in functional connectivity in response to positive social interactions among men and widespread decreases in functional connectivity in response to negative social interactions among women. Nucleus basalis of Meynert, an important regulator of selective attention and motivation with a particularly high density of OT receptors, had the largest number of OT‐modulated connections. Regions known to receive mesolimbic dopamine projections such as the nucleus accumbens and lateral septum were also hubs for OT effects on functional connectivity. Our results suggest that the neural mechanism by which OT influences primate social cognition may include changes in patterns of activity across neural networks that regulate social behavior in other animals.

AB  - Development of ecosystem-based fisheries management models depends, to a large extent, on the availability of trophic interaction data. These models could address ecological questions, examine ecosystem trophic structure, and be used in placement analysis for marine protected areas, among other uses. Many studies on fish trophic interactions have been conducted in the Gulf of Mexico over the past 120 yrs, and we are currently compiling data from these studies into a database. Here, we report on a collection of 747 references, investigate spatial and taxonomic distributions of the fish species examined, and identify data gaps. Metadata lite, a condensed version of customary metadata that answers the who, what, where, when, and why, has been collected on all studies, all references have been geocoded, and habitat characterizations have been standardized using the Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard for about 60% of the references. Visualization tools and products to assist in the synthesis, analysis, and interpretation of the data, including maps, network depictions, and dynamic interactions, are discussed. A survey of trophic data available for fisheries management models for managed species in US Gulf waters appear to be adequate for at least 23 of 50 of managed species, while data for at least 14 species remain insufficient for model development assessment.

AB  - Knowledge of population structure and patterns of connectivity is required to implement effective conservation measures for the purple-crowned fairy-wren (Malurus coronatus), a threatened endemic of northern Australia. This study aimed to identify barriers to dispersal across the distribution of M. coronatus, investigate the impact that the recent declines may have on population connectivity, and propose conservation actions to maintain natural patterns of gene flow. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA sequences from 87 M. coronatus identified two phylogenetic clusters that corresponded with the phenotypically defined western (M. c. coronatus) and eastern (M. c. macgillivrayi) subspecies. The genetic divergence between these subspecies was consistent with isolation by a natural barrier to gene flow, and supports their separate conservation management. Within the declining M. c. coronatus, the lack of genetic divergence and only slight morphological difference between remnant populations indicates that populations were recently linked by gene flow. It is likely that widespread habitat degradation and the recent extirpation of M. c. coronatus from the Ord River will disrupt connectivity between, and dynamics within, remnant populations. To prevent further declines, conservation of M. coronatus must preserve areas of quality habitat and restore connectivity between isolated populations. Genetic and morphological divergence between the two subspecies of Malurus coronatus provides support for their separate conservation management. Historically high levels of dispersal between catchments, indicated by a lack of genetic structure and slight morphological difference between remnant populations of the western subspecies, may be disrupted by recent habitat degradation.

AB  - The mechanisms underpinning the structure of social networks in multiple fish populations were investigated. To our knowledge this is the first study to provide replication of social networks and therefore probably the first that allows general conclusions to be drawn. The social networks were all found to have a non-random structure and exhibited ‘social cliquishness’. A number of factors were observed to contribute to this structuring. Firstly, social network structure was influenced by body length and shoaling tendency, with individuals interacting more frequently with conspecifics of similar body length and shoaling tendency. Secondly, individuals with many social contacts were found to interact with each other more often than with other conspecifics, a phenomenon known as a ‘positive degree correlation’. Finally, repeated interactions between pairs of individuals occurred within the networks more often than expected by random interactions. The observed network structures will have ecological and evolutionary implications. For example, the occurrence of positive degree correlations suggests the possibility that pathogens and information (that are socially transmitted) could spread very fast within the populations. Furthermore, the occurrence of repeated interactions between pairs of individuals fulfils an important pre-requisite for the evolution of reciprocal altruism. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Most primates are intensely social and spend a large amount of time servicing social relationships. In this study, we use social network analysis to examine the relationship between primate group size, total brain size, neocortex ratio and several social network metrics concerned with network cohesion. Using female grooming networks from a number of Old World monkey species, we found that neocortex size was a better predictor of network characteristics than endocranial volumes. We further found that when we controlled for group size, neocortex ratio was negatively correlated with network density, connectivity, relative clan size and proportional clan membership, while there was no effect of neocortex ratio on change in connectivity following the removal of the most central female in the network. Thus, in species with larger neocortex ratios, females generally live in more fragmented networks, belong to smaller grooming clans and are members of relatively fewer clans despite living in a closely bonded group. However, even though groups are more fragmented to begin with among species with larger neocortices, the removal of the most central individual does cause groups to fall apart, suggesting that social complexity may ultimately involve the management of highly fragmented social groups while at the same time maintaining overall social cohesion. These results emphasize a need for more detailed brain data on a wider sample of primate species. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 is endemic in Asia, with live bird trade as a major disease transmission pathway. A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in northern Vietnam to investigate the structure of the live bird market (LBM) contact network and the implications for virus spread. Based on the movements of traders between LBMs, weighted and directed networks were constructed and used for social network analysis and individual-based modeling. Most LBMs were connected to one another, suggesting that the LBM network may support large-scale disease spread. Because of cross-border trade, it also may promote transboundary virus circulation. However, opportunities for disease control do exist. The implementation of thorough, daily disinfection of the market environment as well as of traders' vehicles and equipment in only a small number of hubs can disconnect the network dramatically, preventing disease spread. These targeted interventions would be an effective alternative to the current policy of a complete ban of LBMs in some areas. Some LBMs that have been banned still are very active, and they likely have a substantial impact on disease dynamics, exhibiting the highest levels of susceptibility and infectiousness. The number of trader visits to markets, information that can be collected quickly and easily, may be used to identify LBMs suitable for implementing interventions. This would not require prior knowledge of the force of infection, for which laboratory-confirmed surveillance would be necessary. These findings are of particular relevance for policy development in resource-scarce settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Spatial population theory predicts that synchrony in the dynamics of local populations should decrease as dispersal among populations decreases. Thus, it would be expected that the extinction of local populations and the attendant loss of immigrants to surrounding populations would reduce synchrony. We tested this hypothesis through a large-scale experiment, simulation of the experimental system and general models. Experimental removal of two adjacent subpopulations of the Rocky Mountain Apollo butterfly, Parnassius smintheus within a network consisting of 15 other local populations resulted in a decrease in immigration to surrounding populations that was proportional to their connectivity to the removal populations. These populations also showed a significant increase in synchrony during population removal. The spatial extent of the synchrony showed good agreement with the predicted loss of immigrants owing to the removals. Simulation of the Parnassius system showed a similar short-term result and also indicated that permanent loss of populations produces structural changes increasing synchrony. General models indicate that an increase in synchrony following extinction occurs when populations undergoing extinction have different carrying capacities than surrounding populations. The result is not owing to biased migration per se, but rather is because of the number of immigrants relative to the carrying capacity. Synchrony following extinction should be most common for patchy populations, but can occur in any situation where carrying capacities differ. Overall, our results indicate that local extinction can create a positive feedback for extinction risk, increasing the probability of extinction for population networks by synchronizing their dynamics.

AB  - Hodgson et al. [Journal of Applied Ecology (2009) 964] argue that connectivity is complex and uncertain, that it can be improved incidentally by increasing habitat extent, and that connectivity conservation is unlikely to be effective under climate change. We believe that they have overlooked recent research on dispersal behaviour and structural connectivity, which has improved our understanding of functional connectivity and revealed that it will not necessarily increase with habitat extent. New modelling techniques including least-cost path models incorporate this more detailed understanding of connectivity into conservation planning, facilitating the true aim of connectivity conservation - to ensure appropriate interactions between habitat extent, quality and connectivity. Synthesis and applications. Advances in behavioural research and modelling techniques allow us to manage structural connectivity with as much certainty as we manage extent and quality of habitat. Successful landscape conservation to address both current threats and future climate change must manage these three elements in concert. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The phases at which network neurons fire in rhythmic motor outputs are critically important for the proper generation of motor behaviors. The pyloric network in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion generates a rhythmic motor output wherein neuronal phase relationships are remarkably invariant across individuals and throughout lifetimes. The mechanisms for maintaining these robust pha e relationships over the long-term are not well described. Here we show that tonic nanomolar dopamine (DA) act at type 1 DA receptor (D1Rs) to enable an activity-dependent mechanism that can contribute to phase maintenance in the lateral pyloric (LP) neuron. The LP displays continuous rhythmic bursting. The activity-dependent mechanism was triggered by a prolonged decrease in LP burst duration, and it generated a persistent increase in the maximal conductance ( Gmax) of the LP hyperpolarization-activated current (Jh ), but only in the presence of steady-state DA. Interestingly, micromolar DA produces an LP phase advance accompanied by a decrease in LP burst duration that abolishes normal LP network function. During a 1 h application of micromolar DA, LP phase recovered over tens of minutes because, the activity-dependent mechanism enabled by steady-state DA was triggered by the micromolar DA-induced decrease in LP burst duration. Presumably, thls mechanism restored normal LP network function. These data suggest teady-state DA may enable homeostatic mechanisms that maintain motor network output during protracted neuromodulation. This DA-enabled, activitydependent mechanism to preserve phase may be broadly relevant, as diminished dopaminergic tone has recently been shown to reduce Jh in rhythmically active neurons in the mammalian brain.

AB  - Multidisciplinary approaches to managing seascapes are increasingly being recognized as best practice and therefore prioritized by conservation agencies. For most coastal areas the strengthening of customary marine tenure, rules and regulations should yield even greater biodiversity and livelihood benefits. Here, we present the conservation planning results from a locally-managed marine area programme initiated by the Government of Aceh, Indonesia, which aimed to empower coastal communities to sustainably and equitably manage marine resources with local government. In 2008 the government established a Marine and Fisheries Task Force to identify priority areas for marine biodiversity (through systematic conservation planning) and coastal communities (through participatory planning). In addition to the existing 264,788 ha of marine management units, systematic planning identified another 53,372 ha. However, the subsequent stakeholder participation phase, involving intensive local consultations, further expanded the locally-managed marine area network by 6,725 ha and to a total of 23 locally-managed marine areas. This combined approach had additional benefits because it generated a strong sense of local ownership. For communities it initiated a process for recognizing their customary claimed areas and resolved overlapping boundaries between neighbouring communities, thereby reducing the likelihood of future conflicts over natural resource use. For government, it provided the basis of a robust governance system, with 34 new or revised decrees being completed and an additional USD 1.6 million being allocated for implementation of locally-managed marine areas. This participatory approach should considerably increase the successful delivery of a sustainable and equitable locally-managed marine area network for Aceh, which has wide application for the South-east Asian region and beyond.

AB  - Understanding animal responses to landscape elements helps forecast population reactions to changing landscape conditions. The challenge is that some behaviors are poorly known and difficult to estimate. We assessed how uncertainty in behavioral responses to dense woods, an avoided landscape structure, impacts functional connectivity among reproductive habitat patches for Fender's blue butterfly, an endangered prairie species of western Oregon, USA. We designed a factorial simulation experiment using a spatially explicit individual-based model to project functional connectivity for female butterflies across current and alternative landscapes. We varied the probability of dense woods entry and turning angle standard deviation for movements within the dense woods over a range of biologically reasonable and observed values. Butterflies in the current landscape (46 % dense woods) and one with prairie encroached by forest (60 % dense woods) showed reductions in functional connectivity estimates consistent with the expectations of habitat fragmentation. Although dense woods entrance uncertainty impacted functional connectivity projections, uncertainty in the dense woods turning angle standard deviation had comparatively little impact on connectivity estimates. Reduction and reconfiguration of the current dense woods to 27 % cover (restored landscape) appeared to facilitate a corridor behavior in dispersing individuals, likely providing a functional connectivity estimate comparable to the historic landscape (<5 % dense woods). Our simulations suggest that additional study of butterfly movement within the dense woods is unnecessary and that a partial reduction in dense woods would be sufficient to achieve historic levels of functional connectivity for Fender's blue across the study landscape.

AB  - Environmental change plays a large role in the emergence of infectious disease. The construction of a new road in a previously roadless area of northern coastal Ecuador provides a valuable natural experiment to examine how changes in the social and natural environment, mediated by road construction, affect the epidemiology of diarrheal diseases. Twenty-one villages were randomly selected to capture the full distribution of village population size and distance from a main road (remoteness), and these were compared with the major population center of the region. Borbón, that lies on the road. Estimates of enteric pathogen infection rates were obtained from case-control studies at the village level. Higher rates of infection were found in nonremote vs. remote villages [pathogenic Escherichia coil: odds ratio (OR) = 8.4, confidence interval (CI) 1.6, 43.5; rotavirus: OR = 4.0, (11.3, 12.1; and Giardia: OR = 1.9. (11.3, 2.7]. Higher rates of all-cause diarrhea were found in Borbón compared with the 21 villages (RR = 2.0, CI 1.5, 2.8), as well as when comparing nonremote and remote villages (OR = 2.7, (11.5, 4.8). Social network data collected in parallel offered a causal link between remoteness and disease. The significant and consistent trends across viral, bacterial, and protozoan pathogens suggest the importance of considering a broad range of pathogens with differing epidemiological patterns when assessing the environmental impact of new roads. This study provides insight into the initial health impacts that roads have on communities and into the social and environmental processes that create these impacts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Impairments of spatial awareness and decision making occur frequently as a consequence of parietal lesions. Here we used event-related functional MRI (fMRI) in monkeys to investigate rapid reorganization of spatial networks during reversible pharmacological inactivation of the lateral intraparietal area (LIP), which plays a role in the selection of eye movement targets. We measured fMRI activity in control and inactivation sessions while monkeys performed memory saccades to either instructed or autonomously chosen spatial locations. Inactivation caused a reduction of contralesional choices. Inactivation effects on fMRI activity were anatomically and functionally specific and mainly consisted of: (i) activity reduction in the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus (temporal parietal occipital area) for single contralesional targets, especially in the inactivated hemisphere; and (ii) activity increase accompanying contralesional choices between bilateral targets in several frontal and parieto-temporal areas in both hemispheres. There was no overactivation for ipsilesional targets or choices in the intact hemisphere. Task-specific effects of LIP inactivation on blood oxygen level-dependent activity in the temporal parietal occipital area underline the importance of the superior temporal sulcus for spatial processing. Furthermore, our results agree only partially with the influential interhemispheric competition model of spatial neglect and suggest an additional component of interhemispheric cooperation in the compensation of neglect deficits.

AB  - The Small Sanjiang Plain (SSP), was formerly the largest wetland complex in China, located in the Northeastern part of Heilongjiang Province, China. Home to vast numbers of waterfowls, fish, and plants, the SSP is globally significant for biodiversity conservation. The loss and fragmentation of wetlands as a result agricultural development over 50 years has impacted wetland communities and their biodiversity. We used GIS to inventory large-scale land-use changes from 1950 to 2000, together with other statistical data. We found that 73.6% of the wetlands were lost due to agricultural development. Consequences of these land-use changes included: i) a rapid decline in waterfowl and plant species with the loss and fragmentation of natural wetlands and wetland ecosystem degradation; ii)greater variation in wetland water levels as the result of land-use changes over the years; iii) disruption of the dynamic river-floodplain connection by construction of drainage ditches and levees; and iv) a decrease in floodplain area that caused increased flooding peak flows and runoff. Here we show how these changes affect wetland biodiversity and impact important wetland species. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A basic understanding of how the landscape impedes, or creates resistance to, the dispersal of organisms and hence gene flow is paramount for successful conservation science and management. Spatially structured ecological networks are often used to represent spatial landscape‐genetic relationships, where nodes represent individuals or populations and resistance to movement is represented using non‐binary edge weights. Weights are typically assigned or estimated by the user, rather than observed, and validating such weights is challenging. We provide a synthesis of current methods used to estimate edge weights and an overview of common model types, stressing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and their ability to model landscape‐genetic data. We further explore a set of spatial‐statistical methods that provide ecologists with alternative approaches for modeling spatially explicit processes that may affect genetic structure. This includes an overview of spatial autoregressive models, with a particular focus on how correlation and partial correlation are used to represent neighborhood structure with the inverse of the covariance matrix (i.e., precision matrix). We then demonstrate how to model resistance by specifying an appropriate statistical model on the nodes, conditioned on the edge weights, through the precision matrix. This integration of network ecology and spatial statistics provides a practical analytical framework for landscape‐genetic studies. The results can be used to make statistical inferences about the relative importance of individual landscape characteristics, such as the vegetative cover, hillslope, or the presence of roads or rivers, on gene flow. In addition, the R code we include allows readers to explore landscape‐genetic structure in their own datasets, which will potentially provide new insights into the evolutionary processes that generated ecological networks, as well as valuable information about the optimal characteristics of conservation corridors.

AB  - Key elements of the rapidly expanding field of ecosystem-based management include: (a) understanding connections among social and ecological systems and (b) developing analytical approaches to inform the necessary trade-offs among ecosystem services and human activities in coastal and marine areas. To address these needs, we investigate the impacts of multiple economic sectors on the marine ecosystem and dependent human community in the Gulf of California with an ecological-economic model. We focus on the spotted rose snapper ( Lutjanus guttatus), an economically important species targeted concurrently by the nearshore artisanal fleet, the sportfishing fleet, and by the industrial shrimp fleet as bycatch. Economic returns to the local community are driven by the artisanal fishery catch and the number of tourists who engage in the sportsfishery, and these variables are in turn impacted by fish abundance. We find that the coexistence of the two sectors (and production of both seafood and tourism services) creates stability in key elements of the coupled systems. When the coupled systems are perturbed by changes in exploitation and climate variability, the artisanal fishery responds more rapidly and to a greater degree than the sportsfishery to shifts in the fish population. Our results suggest that vital components of coupled systems may well respond differently to climate variability or other perturbations, and that management strategies should be developed with this in mind. Models like ours can facilitate the development and testing of hypotheses about the form and strength of interactions between ecosystems, services, and the human communities that rely on them.

AB  - Major migration barriers have been identified as an important factor in the drastic reduction of freshwater eel stocks at the catchment scale. In this study, we developed a way to assist decision making in the management of migration barriers so as to increase eel presence throughout the Loire catchment (France). Models were developed according to eel size-class and various different management strategies to improve accessibility, taking into account: (i) all the migration barriers from the tidal limit to different upstream limits (downstream–upstream strategy), (ii) all the migration barriers with a given degree of passability (migration barrier passability class strategy), (iii) all the migration barriers in a given sub-catchment area (sub-catchment strategy) and (iv) all the migration barriers in the entire Loire catchment (global strategy). Eel were actually found to occur in the Loire at about 50% of the sites sampled. The improvement of habitat accessibility by removing all obstacles to colonisation or installing fish passes, for example (global strategy), would lead to eels being found throughout the whole river. If this management strategy is impossible because the high cost, two others, also producing significant eel continental colonisation must be implemented. Either all barriers from the tidal limit with medium passability and/or migration barriers in the sub-catchment area which is closest to the sea and least accessible must be managed. In both cases, the area significantly exploited by eels and the probability that this species will be present will be doubled. However, these results can only be counted on if the fluvial recruitment increases significantly. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Due to concern over potential impact of surface coal mining on a traditional elk calving ground, Colorado Yampa Coal Company conducted a six and one half year study from 1981 to 1987 to monitor elk calving behavior in connection habitat disturbance resulting from mining. The specific objectives were to: (1) determine if productivity of elk is changed as they are displaced from a traditional calving area; (2) determining what fidelity they exhibit to calving areas; and (3) describe the physical and vegetation characteristics of elk calving areas. During the study, 448 elk captures were recorded, 294 individual elk were tagged, 75 of which received radio transmitters. The radio transmitter collared elk were relocated 4,583 times. Telemetry work on the 75 individual elk revealed no negative impacts on elk using the mine site. Productivity, calving home range size and fidelity, and habitat utilization patterns between elk using the mine site and control elk were not significantly different. There has been no indication that elk are abandoning mine areas. Aspen habitats directly adjacent to active mining continue to be selected for during the late spring and summer. Reclaimed sites are used in proportion to their availability during spring and summer and are selected for during the fall and early winter. In addition, a large amount of information on cow elk mortality, summer and winter ranges, migration patterns and habitat utilization was obtained (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - Our understanding of how anthropogenic habitat change shapes species interactions is in its infancy. This is in large part because analytical approaches such as network theory have only recently been applied to characterize complex community dynamics. Network models are a powerful tool for quantifying how ecological interactions are affected by habitat modification because they provide metrics that quantify community structure and function. Here, we examine how large-scale habitat alteration has affected ecological interactions among mixed-species flocking birds in Amazonian rainforest. These flocks provide a model system for investigating how habitat heterogeneity influences non-trophic interactions and the subsequent social structure of forest-dependent mixed-species bird flocks. We analyse 21 flock interaction networks throughout a mosaic of primary forest, fragments of varying sizes and secondary forest (SF) at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project in central Amazonian Brazil. Habitat type had a strong effect on network structure at the levels of both species and flock. Frequency of associations among species, as summarized by weighted degree, declined with increasing levels of forest fragmentation and SF. At the flock level, clustering coefficients and overall attendance positively correlated with mean vegetation height, indicating a strong effect of habitat structure on flock cohesion and stability. Prior research has shown that trophic interactions are often resilient to large-scale changes in habitat structure because species are ecologically redundant. By contrast, our results suggest that behavioural interactions and the structure of non-trophic networks are highly sensitive to environmental change. Thus, a more nuanced, system-by-system approach may be needed when thinking about the resiliency of ecological networks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social species, by definition, form organizations that extend beyond the individual. These structures evolved hand in hand with behavioral, neural, hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms to support them because the consequent social behaviors helped these organisms survive, reproduce, and care for offspring sufficiently long that they too reproduced. Social isolation represents a lens through which to investigate these behavioral, neural, hormonal, cellular, and genetic mechanisms. Evidence from human and nonhuman animal studies indicates that isolation heightens sensitivity to social threats (predator evasion) and motivates the renewal of social connections. The effects of perceived isolation in humans share much in common with the effects of experimental manipulations of isolation in nonhuman social species: increased tonic sympathetic tonus and HPA activation; and decreased inflammatory control, immunity, sleep salubrity, and expression of genes regulating glucocorticoid responses. Together, these effects contribute to higher rates of morbidity and mortality in older adults. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social network analysis is an increasingly popular tool for the study of the fine-scale and global social structure of animals. It has attracted particular attention by those attempting to unravel social structure in fission–fusion populations. It is clear that the social network approach offers some exciting opportunities for gaining new insights into social systems. However, some of the practices which are currently being used in the animal social networks literature are at worst questionable and at best over-enthusiastic. We highlight some of the areas of method, analysis and interpretation in which greater care may be needed in order to ensure that the biology we extract from our networks is robust. In particular, we suggest that more attention should be given to whether relational data are representative, the potential effect of observational errors and the choice and use of statistical tests. The importance of replication and manipulation must not be forgotten, and the interpretation of results requires care. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Connectivity among demes in a metapopulation depends on both the landscape's and the focal organism's properties (including its mobility and cognitive abilities). Using individual-based simulations, we contrast the consequences of three different cognitive strategies on several measures of metapopulation connectivity. Model animals search suitable habitat patches while dispersing through a model landscape made of cells varying in size, shape, attractiveness and friction. In the blind strategy, the next cell is chosen randomly among the adjacent ones. In the near-sighted strategy, the choice depends on the relative attractiveness of these adjacent cells. In the far- sighted strategy, animals may additionally target suitable patches that appear within their perceptual range. Simulations show that the blind strategy provides the best overall connectivity, and results in balanced dispersal. The near-sighted strategy traps animals into corridors that reduce the number of potential targets, thereby fragmenting metapopulations in several local clusters of demes, and inducing sink–source dynamics. This sort of local trapping is somewhat prevented in the far-sighted strategy. The colonization success of strategies depends highly on initial energy reserves: blind does best when energy is high, near-sighted wins at intermediate levels, and far-sighted outcompetes its rivals at low energy reserves. We also expect strong effects in terms of metapopulation genetics: the blind strategy generates a migrant-pool mode of dispersal that should erase local structures. By contrast, near- and far-sighted strategies generate a propagule-pool mode of dispersal and source–sink behavior that should boost structures (high genetic variance among- and low variance within local clusters of demes), particularly if metapopulation dynamics is also affected by extinction–colonization processes. Our results thus point to important effects of the cognitive ability of dispersers on the connectivity, dynamics and genetics of metapopulations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Understanding the relationship between population dynamics and habitat connectivity is crucial for effective conservation and management of wildlife. In this study, we performed a graph-theoretical analysis to identify the relationship between nest distribution of the black-billed magpie Pica pica sericea and well-connected habitat patches. We analyzed 134 nest sites to determine environmental variables important for nesting magpies and identify habitat patches using a logistic model. Connectivity was estimated by Euclidean distance between habitat patches. A randomization procedure was implemented to verify the association between the nest distribution and the degree of habitat connectivity measured at multiple spatial scales. Preferred nesting habitat was areas close to the forest edge, containing more forest cover within 30m of the nest. Connectivity analysis showed that the nest location was highly related to large clusters of habitat patches when patches are connected at large spatial scales. In addition, the nests in forest patches were close to grass patches with high connectivity. However, the size of habitat clusters adjacent to nests was much smaller than the average size of total habitat clusters across most scales, indicating that there are anthropogenic factors (e.g., effect of supplementary food in an urban matrix) affecting the distribution of magpie nests. Our results suggest that the distribution of magpie nests is related to landscape connectivity, which can be more clearly explained by taking into account the anthropogenic factors.

AB  - Patterns of group social structure are often linked to the competitive regime within a social unit and to the availability of kin. In line with this, many studies have shown that the dispersing sex, which is considered to have fewer kin around, is less social, while the philopatric sex has strong social bonds. Chimpanzees were considered to fit well into this scheme with highly social and competing philopatric males and generally asocial and solitary dispersing females. However, recent data suggest that chimpanzee females can indeed be highly social, even though they are unlikely to be related to each other. We studied female sociality in a long-term habituated group living in the Taï Forest, Côte d''Ivoire. Female social relationships as measured by association and grooming preferences were well differentiated and long lasting. Association (and to a lesser extent grooming) bonds were associated with reduced aggression between social partners. In addition, the competitive regime as indicated by group size had a strong effect on female social networks, which were more centralized and less clustered in smaller groups, suggesting that competition may play a major role in shaping female chimpanzee sociality. These findings suggest that strong social bonds can occur even in the absence of a strong network of kin relationships. (Copyright 2009 Elsevier) (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - Pollen flow and dispersal patterns were investigated in a small, isolated forest fragment of the Neotropical insect pollinated tree Copaifera langsdorffii, using paternity analysis and eight microsatellite loci. We also investigated the coancestry and effective population size of progeny arrays for conservation and environmental restoration purposes. Open-pollinated seeds were collected from 15 seed trees within the forest fragment, in which all adult trees were mapped, measured and genotyped. Twenty seeds were also collected from the nearest neighbor tree located 1.2 km from the forest fragment. Our results show that levels of genetic diversity were significantly higher in adults than offspring and significant levels of inbreeding were detected in offspring ( F = 0.226). From paternity analysis, we observed low levels of selfing ( s = 8%) and pollen immigration ( m = 8%) in the fragment, but very high levels were detected for the isolated tree ( s = 20%; m = 75%), indicating that the population and the tree are not reproductively isolated and are connected by patterns of long distance pollen dispersal (maximum detected 1,420 m). Within the forest fragment, the pattern of pollen dispersal was a near neighbor pattern with 49% of the pollen being dispersed within 50 m. The effective population size of the progeny array was low, indicating the need to collect seeds from a large number of seed trees (at least 76) for conservation purposes. The results show that the spatial isolation of the population and isolated tree due to forest fragmentation has not disrupted genetic connectivity; however, spatial isolation does seem to increase selfing and correlated mating.

AB  - The importance of unprotected habitats for the persistence of species in reserve networks is likely to be high for species living in highly fragmented habitat in which regional persistence depends on metapopulation processes. The dingy skipper butterfly (Erynnis tages ) is a regionally rare declining species in Britain. In the Creuddyn Peninsula (North Wales), it inhabits patches of its host plant, Lotus corniculatus L., growing in lightly grazed areas in sheltered microhabitats, and its regional distribution is dominated by metapopulation processes. In this area, 16 (61%) out of 26.20 ha of dingy skipper habitat are located in reserves. The remaining unprotected habitat is mostly located in wasteland areas vulnerable to urban development. Using a metapopulation model, the incidence function model, I evaluated the extent to which the persistence of the dingy skipper in the landscape could be guaranteed with the existing reserve network. According to model projections, the dynamics within the reserve system were relatively stable when the unprotected habitat remained, with a maximum of 4% simulation replicates going extinct in a 100-year time frame. When unprotected habitat was completely removed, however, the dynamics in the reserve network became markedly unstable, with an increased extinction risk ranging from 15 to 36%. We calculated a relatively simple measure of “patch importance,” the colonization potential, for each patch. The incidence function model predicted that for low and medium levels of regional stochasticity (σ value from 0 to 0.2), protecting only a relatively small number (four to six) of large and well-connected patches (high colonization potential) in addition to the existing reserves would be enough to decrease notably the extinction risk of the dingy skipper metapopulation. The number of patches needed to be increased (11 patches) for high levels of regional stochasticity (σ= 0.3). My results suggest that long-term persistence of a regionally rare butterfly in a reserve network may depend on the presence of unprotected habitat. For a more realistic estimate of the efficiency of reserves for protecting rare species, conservation biologists should consider incorporating metapopulation dynamics in their evaluations of persistence in existing reserves.

AB  - Abstract: Cattle are considered to be the main reservoir for Vero cytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O157, a cause of food-poisoning (and even death) in humans. Here, the transmission of E. coli O157 within a typical UK dairy herd is modelled using a semi-stochastic network model. The model incorporates demographic as well as infection processes. Indirect transmission is modelled homogeneously, while direct transmission is modelled via a dynamic contact network. The aim was to investigate the effects of heterogeneity and clustering on the prevalence of infection within the herd and discover whether, particularly in terms of choosing an intervention strategy, it is necessary to include heterogeneity in direct contacts when modelling this sort of system. Results show that heterogeneity in direct contacts can make it more difficult for the pathogen to persist, particularly when the average number of contacts (per animal) in each group is small. They also show that the relationship between clustering and prevalence is not simple. For example, increasing the average number of contacts can increase clustering and prevalence. However, when the average number of contacts in each group is sufficiently high, higher clustering leads to lower prevalence. It would seem that clustering can aid the flow of infection under certain circumstances, but hinder it under others (probably by preventing wider dissemination). Further results show that indirect transmission (as it is modelled here) effectively removes the effect of heterogeneity in direct contacts. In terms of investigating proposed interventions, the results suggest that a network model would only be required if there was evidence to suggest that direct transmission was the major source of infection.

AB  - Abstract: European agricultural landscapes are mosaics of intensively cultivated areas and semi-natural elements. Although comprising only a small fraction of the total area, semi-natural elements provide habitat for most of the landscape biodiversity. Agricultural intensification has increasingly fragmented semi-natural elements and species numbers are in decline. Insights into the effects of landscape structure on species’ distributions within and among semi-natural habitats are needed to conserve biodiversity in agricultural landscapes more effectively. We investigated the landscape- and habitat-specific diversity partitions of wild bees, true bugs, and carabid beetles in two differently structured agricultural landscapes in Switzerland. In each landscape, we partitioned the total species diversity (γ) into its additive components within (α <sub>P</sub>) and among patches (β <sub>P</sub>) and among habitats (β <sub>H</sub>). In the landscape characterized by a patchy, isolated distribution of habitat elements, among-patch diversity (β <sub>P</sub>) explained 44% of the total species richness (γ) and was significantly higher than expected under a random distribution of samples among habitat patches; in the landscape with higher habitat connectivity, among-patch diversity (β <sub>P</sub>) comprised 32% of the total species richness (γ) and did not differ from the random expectation. Habitat-specific within-patch contributions to species richness were similarly low across habitat types (α <sub>P</sub>=23–24%) in the patchy landscape, whereas in the more connected landscape within-patch partitions tended to be higher and differed among habitat types (α <sub>P</sub>=22–38%). Functionally different groups of bees, true bugs, and carabids also responded differently to landscape structure in a manner that was consistent with known differences in resource specialization and dispersal ability. Differences in diversity partitions among landscapes and taxa indicate the need for flexible conservation strategies. Conservation of habitat-specific diversity may require more habitat patches in landscapes that have lower habitat connectivity and low within-patch diversity (α <sub>P</sub>) than in landscapes with higher within-patch diversity (α <sub>P</sub>).

AB  - We developed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models to predict fish species richness as a function of two simple landscape-scale, binary variables (surface water connectivity to other aquatic systems and human riparian development), with lake surface area as the covariate. All three variables were significantly related to species richness and explained 61 % of the variance in a data set from 55 limnologically similar lakes in northern Wisconsin. We developed additional ANCOVA models to assess the relative effects of these three variables on four functional species groups, including gamefish, riverine, tolerant, and intolerant species. The number of gamefish species was greater in lakes with riparian development than in undeveloped lakes; this is probably related to introductions by management agencies and anglers. Connectivity increased the number of riverine species and intolerant species. Intolerant species may he more abundant because connecting streams provide colonization routes and decrease time between periodic extirpation and recolonization events. In addition, flowing water connections may provide a refuge from winter hypoxia and decrease extirpation rates of intolerant species. Tolerant fishes were ubiquitous on the landscape and unaffected by the measured variables. Because simple landscape variables can dominate assemblage dynamics of small lakes, and human-mediated introductions can increase species richness at low and moderate levels of disturbance, the use of fish as biological indicators for small lake assessment is not practical.

AB  - Pollination networks are representations of all interactions between co-existing plants and their flower visiting animals at a given site. Although the study of networks has become a distinct sub-discipline in pollination biology, few studies have attempted to quantify spatio-temporal variation in species composition and structure of networks. We here investigate patterns of year-to-year change in pollination networks from six different sites spanning a large latitudinal gradient. We quantified level of species persistence and interactions among years, and examined year-to-year variation of network structural parameters in relation to latitude and sampling effort. In addition, we tested for correlations between annual variation in network parameters and short and long-term climate change variables. Numbers of plant and animal species and interactions were roughly constant from one year to another at all sites. However, composition of species and interactions changed from one year to another. Turnover was particularly high for flower visitors and interactions. On the other hand, network structural parameters (connectance, nestedness, modularity and centralization) remained remarkably constant between years, regardless of network size and latitude. Inter-annual variation of network parameters was not related to short or long term variation in climate variables (mean annual temperature and annual precipitation). We thus conclude that pollination networks are highly dynamic and variable in composition of species and interactions among years. However, general patterns of network structure remain constant, indicating that species may be replaced by topologically similar species. These results suggest that pollination networks are to some extent robust against factors affecting species occurrences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Habitat geometry has been a primary focus in studies of spatially structured systems. Recent studies have indicated that a more comprehensive approach including habitat quality may be needed, however most previous studies have neglected potential interactions between quality and geometry. We investigated the effects of habitat quality for the butterfly Parnassius smintheus among a series of 17 sub-populations. Specifically, we examined how habitat connectivity and local nectar flower density affect dispersal, and local population abundance and growth. We first determined which flower species were potentially important by examining nectar flower electivity and then quantified nectar flower density in meadows over a five year period (2003–2007). These data along with meadow connectivity were compared to local population statistics derived from mark–recapture over the same time period. The number of immigrants to a meadow increased as meadow connectivity increased, but showed no direct relationship with nectar flower density; however, there was a significant interaction between meadow connectivity and nectar flower density such that meadows with high connectivity and a high density of nectar flowers received the greatest number of immigrants. The number of emigrants from a meadow increased with increasing habitat quality and connectivity, but showed no interactive effect. The abundance of butterflies increased with meadow connectivity, but showed no relationship with habitat quality or any interactive effect. Separate experiments showed that access to nectar flowers significantly increased female reproductive output, but not lifespan. Despite the effects on immigration and reproductive output, local population growth rates also showed no relationship to nectar flower density. Our results indicate that habitat quality can be important for immigration in spatially structured populations; however, effects of habitat quality may not necessarily translate into higher abundance or population growth. Additionally, habitat quality should not be considered independently from habitat isolation, particularly if it directly affects dispersal. Preserving or augmenting habitat quality will do little to bolster immigration or colonization without adequate connectivity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Fishers often rely on their social capital to cope with resource fluctuations by sharing information on the abundance and location of fish. Drawing on research in seven coastal fishing communities in Loreto, Baja California Sur, Mexico, we examine the effect of resource scarcity on the bonding, bridging, and linking social-capital patterns of fishers' information-sharing networks. We found that: (1) fishers' information sharing is activated in response to varying ecological conditions; (2) resource scarcity is an ambiguous indicator of the extent to which fishers share information on the abundance and location of fish within and between communities; (3) information sharing is based on trust and occurs through kinship, friendship, and acquaintance social relations; (4) friendship ties play a key and flexible role in fishers' social networks within and between communities; (5) overall, the composition of fishers' social networks follows a friendship>kinship>acquaintance order of importance; and (6) the function of social ties, internal conflict, and settlement histories moderate the effects of resource scarcity on fishers' social capital. We conclude by arguing that the livelihoods of fishers from Loreto have adaptive capacity for dealing with fish fluctuations but little or no proactive resilience to address resource-management issues.

AB  - In the past several decades, the development of novel molecular techniques and the advent of noninvasive DNA sampling, coupled with the ease and speed with which molecular analyses can now be performed, have made it possible for primatologists to directly examine the fitness effects of individual behavior and to explore how variation in behavior and social systems influences primate population genetic structure. This review describes the theoretical connections between individual behavior and primate social systems on the one hand and population genetic structure on the other, discusses the kinds of molecular markers typically employed in genetic studies of primates, and summarizes what primatologists have learned from molecular studies over the past few decades about dispersal patterns, mating systems, reproductive strategies, and the influence of kinship on social behavior. Several important conclusions can be drawn from this overview. First, genetic data confirm that, in many species, male dominance rank and fitness are positively related, at least over the short term, though this relationship need not simply be a reflection of male-male contest competition over mates. More importantly, genetic research reveals the significance of female choice in determining male reproductive success, and documents the efficacy of alternative mating tactics among males. Second, genetic data suggest that the presumed importance of kinship in structuring primate social relationships needs to be evaluated further, at least for some taxa such as chimpanzees in which demographic factors may be more important than relatedness. I conclude this paper by offering several suggestions of additional ways in which molecular techniques might be employed in behavioral and ecological studies of primates (e.g., for conducting 'molecular censuses' of unhabituated populations, for studying disease and host-parasite interactions, or for tracking seed fate in studies of seed dispersal) and by providing a brief introduction to the burgeoning field of nonhuman primate behavioral genetics.

AB  - Interpopulation variability in patterns of food processing, similar to what is described as "traditional" or "cultural" variation in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), was identified in white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus). However, recent comparisons of food processing in capuchins were conducted only at the population level, with relatively little attention given to variability among groups, age/sex classes, or individuals. This paper examines variability in the processing of specific food types within the context of various social networks (i.e., patterns of association, rank, and kinship) among free-ranging Cebus capucinus at Santa Rosa National Park in Costa Rica. We collected data on two groups of white-faced capuchins in 2001, identifying rates of "food interest" for each individual, as well as forms of processing for specific food types. Juveniles exhibited the most interest in the food-processing behavior of other group members, and food interest was directed most frequently toward adult females. We identified distinctive processing techniques for several food items (Luehea candida pods, Sloanea terniflara fruits, and caterpillars) that facilitated comparisons among individuals within groups. Food-processing techniques for Sloanea fruit and caterpillars appeared to vary independently of the social networks examined in this study. However, we found evidence that variation in Luehea candida processing is to some degree linked to both patterns of association and social rank. The potential influence of these variables on observed food processing patterns warrants further scrutiny. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Ecology Letters (2010) 13: 543–552 The spatial insurance hypothesis indicates that connectivity is an important attribute of natural ecosystems that sustains both biodiversity and ecosystem function. We tested the hypothesis by measuring the impact of manipulating connectivity in experimental metacommunties of a natural and diverse microecosystem. Isolation led to the extinction of large-bodied apex predators, subsequently followed by increases in prey species abundance. This trophic cascade was associated with significantly altered carbon and nitrogen fluxes in fragmented treatments. The ecosystem impacts were characteristic of a function debt because they persisted for several generations after the initial loss of connectivity. Local extinctions and disruption of ecosystem processes were mitigated, and even reversed, by the presence of corridors in the connected metacommunities, although these beneficial effects were unexpectedly delayed. We hypothesized that corridors maintained grazer movement between fragments, which enhanced microbial activity, and decomposition in comparison to isolated fragments. Our results indicate that knowledge of habitat connectivity and spatial processes is essential to understand the magnitude and timing of ecosystem perturbation in fragmented landscapes.

AB  - We designed an individual-based simulation model to explore the effects of landscape spatial structure and connectivity on the populationsize and persistence of two woodland small mammal species, eastern chipmunks (Tamias striatus) and whitefooted mice (Peromyscus leucopus), occurring in an agricultural landscape and occupying different positions on a gradient of behavioural flexibility in response to landscape change. Chipmunks represent a less flexible response, retaining their preference for wooded habitat. White-footed mice represent a moreflexible, opportunistic response, expanding their use of the landscape to include corn and small-grain fields. Model parameters were derived from our field studies, The simulations followed chipmunk populations over 25 yr in 36 landscape patterns, each with a unique combination of amount of wooded habitat (10%, 30%, or 50% of the total area),subdivision of wooded habitat (2, 4, or 8 patches), and quality of connectivity (high, intermediate, low, or none). Mouse populations were simulated in 8 of these landscapes (30% wooded habitat, 4 patches at each level of connectivity, and 10% wooded habitat, 8 patches at each level of connectivity). Generalist mice outperformed specialist chipmunks in all subdivided landscapes in which they were compared. Since generalist mice were not restricted to woods and fencerows, all landscapes were highly connected for them and provided over 75% usable habitat. Survival rates for these mice were high in all landscape patterns. For opportunistic species able to use novel resources, landscape change may not be limiting. Connectivity was the best predictor ofpopulation persistence for specialist species that view the matrix as hostile. Chipmunk population survival was always greater in connected landscapes than in unconnected ones. Interactions of connectivity,composition and configuration were also important. Long survival times and low probabilities of extinction for chipmunk populations occurred i [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Infectious diseases may place strong selection on the social organization of animals. Conversely, the structure of social systems can influence the evolutionary trajectories of pathogens. While much attention has focused on the evolution of host sociality or pathogen virulence separately, few studies have looked at their coevolution. Here we use an agent-based simulation to explore host–pathogen coevolution in social contact networks. Our results indicate that under certain conditions, both host sociality and pathogen virulence exhibit continuous cycling. The way pathogens move through the network (e.g., their interhost transmission and probability of superinfection) and the structure of the network can influence the existence and form of cycling.

AB  - Learning of stimulus sequences is considered as a characteristic feature of episodic memory since it contains not only a particular item but also the experience of preceding and following events. In sensorimotor tasks resembling navigational performance, the serial order of objects is intimately connected with spatial order. Mammals and birds develop episodic(- like) memory in serial spatio-temporal tasks, and the honeybee learns spatio-temporal order when navigating between the nest and a food source. Here I examine the structure of the bees' memory for a combined spatio-temporal task. I ask whether discrimination and generalization are based solely on simple forms of stimulus-reward learning or whether they require sequential configurations. Animals were trained to fly either left or right in a continuous T-maze. The correct choice was signaled by the sequence of colors (blue, yellow) at four positions in the access arm. If only one of the possible 4 signals is shown (either blue or yellow), the rank order of position salience is 1, 2 and 3 (numbered from T-junction). No learning is found if the signal appears at position 4. If two signals are shown, differences at positions 1 and 2 are learned best, those at position 3 at a low level, and those at position 4 not at all. If three or more signals are shown these results are corroborated. This salience rank order again appeared in transfer tests, but additional configural phenomena emerged. Most of the results can be explained with a simple model based on the assumption that the four positions are equipped with different salience scores and that these add up independently. However, deviations from the model are interpreted by assuming stimulus configuration of sequential patterns. It is concluded that, under the conditions chosen, bees rely most strongly on memories developed during simple forms of associative reward learning, but memories of configural serial patterns contribute, too.

AB  - Transmission of infectious diseases is strongly influenced by who contacts whom. Despite the global distribution of tuberculosis (TB) in free-living wild mammal populations, little is known of the mechanisms of social transmission of Mycobacterium bovis between individuals. Here, I use a network approach to examine for correlations between five distinct types of intra- and intergroup social interaction and changes in TB status of 110 wild meerkats (Suricata suricatta) in five social groups over two years. Contrary to predictions, the most socially interactive animals were not at highest risk of acquiring infection, indicating that in addition to contact frequency, the type and direction of interactions must be considered when quantifying disease risk. Within social groups, meerkats that groomed others most were more likely to become infected than individuals who received high levels of grooming. Conversely, receiving, but not initiating, aggression was associated with M. bovis infection. Incidence of intergroup roving by male meerkats was correlated with the rovers themselves subsequently testing TB-positive, suggesting a possible route for transmission of infection between social groups. Exposure time was less important than these social interactions in influencing TB risk. This study represents a novel application of social network analysis using empirical data to elucidate the role of specific interactions in the transmission of an infectious disease in a free-living wild animal population.

AB  - Summary 1. Over the past centuries, European streams have been heavily influenced by humans through pollution and regulation. As a result, the quality and diversity of freshwater riparian habitats have declined strongly, and the diversity of riparian flora and fauna has decreased. Recent restoration measures have resulted in stream habitat improvements, but biodiversity improvements have failed to follow in fragmented streams. It has been suggested that dispersal limitation could play an important role in the lack of biodiversity improvement in restored streams, but to date, there is no conclusive evidence for this assumption. 2. In this study, we investigated whether colonization of restored streams by plants and macroinvertebrates is limited by dispersal. We hypothesized that colonization success increases with increasing availability of (nearby) source populations and with increasing ability of species to disperse over long distances. We related species composition in seven restored stream sections to species' abundances in the surroundings and to species' dispersal abilities. 3. For both plants and macroinvertebrates, colonization success is strongly related to the abundance of species in the local and regional species pools. 4. For plants, dispersal strategy has an additional influence on colonization success: short-lived plants with high production of small, well-dispersed seeds colonized best within the 3- to 5-year period after restoration. 5. The existence of dispersal strategy constraints could not be confirmed in macroinvertebrates, possibly because these are limited by a lack of connectivity on larger spatial scales. On the landscape scale, beneficial effects of increased plant diversity might further improve habitat suitability for macroinvertebrates. 6. Synthesis and applications. Dispersal appears to be a limiting factor for successful (re)colonization of restored streams in fragmented landscapes. In plants, this is attributed to limitations in seed dispersal abilities and likely to a lack of nearby source populations as well. In macroinvertebrates, lack of nearby source populations may also be a limiting factor. Hence, we suggest restoring landscape connectivity at larger spatial scales and optimizing the availability of near-natural 'source' areas in the vicinity of restoration projects, at least for plants, to improve the success of biodiversity restoration in fragmented habitats.

AB  - Japanese freshwater fish habitats can be generally categorized into 1) rivers and streams, 2) ponds and lakes, and 3) rice fields and small irrigation channels connecting them. Of these, reviewing studies on stream fish habitat is the primary objective of this paper. Streams in Japan have widely received severe habitat alterations through construction of artificial instream structures as well as modification of riparian vegetations. As a result, streamdwelling fishes that require natural flow regimes, substrates, and riparian vegetation have declined their populations in great deal in many parts of the country. Recent studies have found riparian forests control water temperature and provide woody debris creating cover structures for the stream fishes resulting in enhancing their carrying capacity. Differences in riparian vegetation types (forest versus grass) played an important role in determining the local distribution of salmonids. Also, experiments removing concrete-lined channel and installing log-drop structures demonstrated that such the treatment greatly improved fish habitat. As the general public became aware of the serious degradation of aquatic habitats, river management policy has gradually shifted to include conservation and improvement of river environment as habitat for wildlife during the last two decades. For fish migration, installation of fishway on dams has been prevailing, and research efforts have been made to design more effective fishway and passable weirs. In many cases, however, such restoration work lacks ecological data for assessment of their effectiveness. accumulated, a vital issue will be how it is accounted into actual management. Future studies on fish habitat should shift toward treating habitat network at larger spatial scales to seek better designs for distributing appropriate habitats over a whole catchment. Such studies should also include clarifying the habitat requirements of endangered species and effects of non-native on native species. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Synthetic biology provides insight into natural gene-network dynamics and enables assembly of engineered transcription circuitries for production of difficult-to-access therapeutic molecules. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis EthR binds to a specific operator (O<sub>ethR</sub>) thereby repressing ethA and preventing EthA-catalyzed conversion of the prodrug ethionamide, which increases the resistance of the pathogen to this last-line-of-defense treatment. We have designed a synthetic mammalian gene circuit that senses the EthRO<sub>ethR</sub> interaction in human cells and produces a quantitative reporter gene expression readout. Challenging of the synthetic network with compounds of a rationally designed chemical library revealed 2-phenylethyl-butyrate as a nontoxic substance that abolished EthR's repressor function inside human cells, in mice, and within M. tuberculosis where it triggered derepression of ethA and increased the sensitivity of this pathogen to ethionamide. The discovery of antituberculosis compounds by using synthetic mammalian gene circuits may establish a new line of defense against multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: The mitigation of stress by social support is of obvious interest and widely studied. Animal models have been used extensively to elucidate the mechanisms involved. Typically, these examine the effects of social housing versus isolation, imparting resistance to stress before it is applied, or ameliorating its effects post hoc. Few experiments directly compare stress impinging upon an individual alone or in a social milieu. Here we compare the effects of stress on a solitary rat and on pairs of rats in a structured rank order of social propinquity. Rats were placed on a raised platform for 30 min under four conditions manipulating the degree of proximity between the rats: alone on the platform in the test room, on the platform with a cagemate in a cage elsewhere in the room, two rats each on a raised platform 40 cm apart and two rats each on a raised platform 0 cm apart. Immediately after the stress, the rats were tested in an open field. We find that stress is mitigated proportionally: stress was reduced the more salient the other rat''s cues were and the closer the rats were to each other. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Social network theory has made major contributions to our understanding of human social organisation but has found relatively little application in the field of animal behaviour. In this review, we identify several broad research areas where the networks approach could greatly enhance our understanding of social patterns and processes in animals. The network theory provides a quantitative framework that can be used to characterise social structure both at the level of the individual and the population. These novel quantitative variables may provide a new tool in addressing key questions in behavioural ecology particularly in relation to the evolution of social organisation and the impact of social structure on evolutionary processes. For example, network measures could be used to compare social networks of different species or populations making full use of the comparative approach. However, the networks approach can in principle go beyond identifying structural patterns and also can help with the understanding of processes within animal populations such as disease transmission and information transfer. Finally, understanding the pattern of interactions in the network (i.e. who is connected to whom) can also shed some light on the evolution of behavioural strategies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

For example, network measures could be used to compare social networks of different species or populations making full use of the comparative approach. However, the networks approach can in principle go beyond identifying structural patterns and also can help with the understanding of processes within animal populations such as disease transmission and information transfer. Finally, understanding the pattern of interactions in the network (i.e. who is connected to whom) can also shed some light on the evolution of behavioural strategies.

AB  - Many species have to track changes in the spatial distribution of suitable habitat from generation to generation. Understanding the dynamics of such species will likely require spatially explicit models, and patch-based metapopulation models are potentially approptiate. However, relatively little attention has been paid to developing metapopulation models that include habitat dynamics, and very little to testing the predictions of these models. We tested three predictions from theory about the differences between dynamic habitat metapopulations and their static counterparts using long-term survey data from two metapopulations of the butterfly Plebejus argus. As predicted, we showed first that the metapopulation inhabiting dynamic habitat had a lower level of habitat occupancy, which could not be accounted for by other differences between the metapopulations. Secondly, we found that patch occupancy did not significantly increase with increasing patch connectivity in dynamic habitat, whereas there was a strong positive connectivity-occupancy relationship in static habitat. Thirdly, we found no significant relationship between patch occupandy and patch quality in dynamic habitat, whereas there was a strong, positive, quality-occupancy relationship in static habitat. Modeling confirmed that the differences in mean patch occupancy and connectivity—occupancy slope could arise without changing the species' metapopulation parameters—importantly, without changing the dependence of colonization upon connectivity. We found that, for a range of landscape scenarios, successional simulations always produced a lower connectivity-occupancy slope than comparable simulations with static patches, whether compared' like-for-like or controlling for mean occupancy. We conclude that landscape-scale studies may often underestimate the importance of connectivity for species occurrence and persistence because habitat turnover can obscure the connectivity- occupancy relationship in commonly available snapshot data.

AB  - Branching growth is present both in plants and animals, either marine or terrestrial. Although cellular and other modular levels of organization in plants and animals have evolved through different molecular and physiological mechanisms, several aspects of their branching modular system and morphology are similar. We studied vessel organization and colony integration, in order to comprehend underlying relationships between different structural components in a gorgonian coral network. The theoretical formalism was validated in the gorgonian coral Eunicea mammosa (Plexauridae, Octocorallia) in Belize. As in vascular plants, these colonial animals create a complex network of connections among modular branches integrated in stem canals downstream toward the base. A new formalism is proposed for describing gorgonian branching. A global property of a colony is for instance the size of its base or its weight whereas a local property is the size of branch in a particular place of the colony. However, a global property is not the simple addition of local modular properties, as the case of stem canals in the colony base. Theoretically, the process of branching is tightly intertwined with the internal network organization. The colony network centralization is driven by a linear relationship between the total number of branches and the stem canals at the base of the colony. If stem canals play important roles in the transport of nutrients throughout the colony and the biomechanical support from the base up to the tips, we can assume that there is an underlying association between the number of stem canals at the base and the number of for example, terminal branches. These associations may provide new findings that extend our understanding of the functional organization of tree-like networks in octocorals and their vascular systems. The idea that the external components of a tree-like plant network are directly correlated and connected down to the main trunk seems to be analogous in an animal system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The ability to discriminate conspecific vocalizations is observed across species and early during development. However, its neurophysiologic mechanism remains controversial, particularly regarding whether it involves specialized processes with dedicated neural machinery. We identified spatiotemporal brain mechanisms for conspecific vocalization discrimination in humans by applying electrical neuroimaging analyses to auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) in response to acoustically and psychophysically controlled nonverbal human and animal vocalizations as well as sounds of man-made objects. AEP strength modulations in the absence of topographic modulations are suggestive of statistically indistinguishable brain networks. First, responses were significantly stronger, but topographically indistinguishable to human versus animal vocalizations starting at 169-219 ms after stimulus onset and within regions of the right superior temporal sulcus and superior temporal gyrus. This effect correlated with another AEP strength modulation occurring at 291-357 ms that was localized within the left inferior prefrontal and precentral gyri. Temporally segregated and spatially distributed stages of vocalization discrimination are thus functionally coupled and demonstrate how conventional views of functional specialization must incorporate network dynamics. Second, vocalization discrimination is not subject to facilitated processing in time, but instead lags more general categorization by ~100 ms, indicative of hierarchical processing during object discrimination. Third, although differences between human and animal vocalizations persisted when analyses were performed at a single-object level or extended to include additional (man-made) sound categories, at no latency were responses to human vocalizations stronger than those to all other categories. Vocalization discrimination transpires at times synchronous with that of face discrimination but is not functionally specialized. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Human activity can have a large impact on surrounding ecosystems. For example, humans alter resource distributions for other species, potentially modifying these species competitive dynamics. These changes in local competitive processes are frequently associated with species invasions. Here, we investigate how differences in resource distribution affect competitive behaviour using the highly invasive European shore crab ( Carcinus maenas). Using a controlled laboratory experiment in combination with behaviour assays and social network analysis, we show that individuals feeding in habitats with clumped food distributions are more aggressive than individuals feeding in habitats where food is evenly dispersed, and this aggression is present even on days where crabs are not feeding. Additionally, this persistent aggression can be induced, suggesting that individuals of this invasive species possess the flexibility to modify their competitive behaviours in response to differences in food distributions. Furthermore, we show how these individual responses can lead to changes in overall organisation of aggressive interactions within a population. We discuss these results in relation to how human impacts can have long-term effects on competitive behavioural strategies, and how behavioural flexibility can allow invasive species to colonise and persist in highly impacted sites such as urban ecosystems.

AB  - A growing body of neuroimaging research has documented that, in the absence of an explicit task, the brain shows temporally coherent activity. This so-called "resting state" activity or, more explicitly, the default-mode network, has been associated with daydreaming, free association, stream of consciousness, or inner rehearsal in humans, but similar patterns have also been found under anesthesia and in monkeys. Spatiotemporal activity patterns in the default-mode network are both complex and consistent, which raises the question whether they are the expression of an interesting cognitive architecture or the consequence of intrinsic network constraints. In numerical simulation, we studied the dynamics of a simplified cortical network using 38 noise-driven (Wilson-Cowan) oscillators, which in isolation remain just below their oscillatory threshold. Time delay coupling based on lengths and strengths of primate corticocortical pathways leads to the emergence of 2 sets of 40-Hz oscillators. The sets showed synchronization that was anticorrelated at <0.1 Hz across the sets in line with a wide range of recent experimental observations. Systematic variation of conduction velocity, coupling strength, and noise level indicate a high sensitivity of emerging synchrony as well as simulated blood flow blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) on the underlying parameter values. Optimal sensitivity was observed around conduction velocities of 1-2 m/s, with very weak coupling between oscillators. An additional finding was that the optimal noise level had a characteristic scale, indicating the presence of stochastic resonance, which allows the network dynamics to respond with high sensitivity to changes in diffuse feedback activity.

AB  - Abstract: Male mammals employ a wide variety of mating strategies in order to increase their reproductive success, which in turn influence their social behavior. In some populations of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops spp.), males cooperate in small groups or alliances to gain access to females for mating. However, the occurrence of these male cooperative groups has been predicted to occur only under certain social and ecological conditions, driven by factors such as differences in population density, operational sex ratio, and sexual size dimorphism. Here, we used generalized affiliation indices, social network techniques, and maternally and bi-parentally inherited genetic markers to investigate the affiliation patterns and genetic relatedness among male southern Australian bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops cf. australis) in a small embayment in South Australia. Photo-identification data and biopsy samples were collected in Coffin Bay from 2013 to 2015 through systematic boat-based surveys. We found that highly sighted male dolphins formed 12 social clusters composed of two to five individuals. Genetic analyses revealed that general male affiliation patterns were significantly correlated with mtDNA haplotype sharing. In addition, preferred affiliates showed significantly higher levels of genetic relatedness compared to casual and avoided male pairs. Our results corroborate theoretical expectations for the formation of social bonds in small delphinids and suggest that a high density of dolphins, with an expected skewed operational sex ratio and no apparent sexual size dimorphism, is likely to have favored the formation of strong male affiliations. In addition, the availability of genetic relatives within the population may have favored male affiliations based on kinship relationships.Significance statement: Male bottlenose dolphins use different strategies to gain access to females, from single roving individuals, pairs or trios in alliances, to stable mixed-sex groups. Moreover, the role of kinship in the formation of male social bonds also varies within and among populations. This variability has been attributed to differences in ecological and intrinsic factors. Here, we studied the affiliation patterns and genetic relatedness in southern Australian bottlenose dolphins and demonstrated that kinship plays an important role in the formation of close male social ties. Furthermore, the results corroborate previous findings about the factors that contribute to the formation of male social bonds in these animals. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Gene flow in riverine species is constrained by the dendritic (branching) structure of the river network. Spatial genetic structure (SGS) of freshwater insects is particularly influenced by catchment characteristics and land use in the surroundings of the river. Gene flow also depends on the life cycle of organisms. Aquatic larvae mainly drift downstream whereas flying adults can disperse actively overland and along watercourses. In-stream movements can generate isolation by distance (IBD) at a local scale and differentiation between subcatchments. However, these patterns can be disrupted by overland dispersal. We studied SGS across the Loire River in the damselfly Calopteryx splendens which is able to disperse along and between watercourses. Our sampling design allowed us to test for overland dispersal effects on genetic differentiation between watercourses. Amplified fragment length polymorphism markers revealed high genetic differentiation at the catchment scale but the genetic structure did not reflect the geographical structure of sampling sites. We observed IBD patterns when considering the distance following the watercourse but also the Euclidean distance, i.e. the shortest distance, between pairs of sites. Altogether, our results support the hypothesis of overland dispersal between watercourses. From a conservation perspective, attention should be paid to the actual pathways of gene flow across complex landscapes such as river networks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A scientific growth area in recent years has been the study of networks of interacting entities within a population, including species in food webs, human or other animals transmitting infection, proteins in cells, cells in organisms (e.g. neuronal networks), the internet and the World Wide Web. Here, I review some of the differing network patterns that arise in theory and in practice, with an emphasis on their dynamical implications, particularly for resistance to deliberate or accidental disturbance. I offer caveats and opinionated comment about some excesses of enthusiasm and suggest some areas where these network ideas might find further application (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - Abstract Many semi-natural landscape elements, the so-called green veining, are disappearing from the intensively used agricultural landscapes of Europe. In order to develop or restore biodiversity in these networks, it is necessary to quantify the relation between biodiversity and amount, spatial arrangement and management intensity of green veining elements. In this review, we investigate whether biodiversity increases with the amount of green veining in an agricultural landscape following the species–area relationship, and whether a certain level of biodiversity can be reached at lower densities of green veining if green veining elements are better connected (higher spatial connectivity) or if they are managed less intensively (lower management intensity). We reviewed studies on aboveground biodiversity in green veining structures in 39 scientific papers on field and experimental studies within Europe. More of these studies focussed on management intensity than on amount or spatial configuration of green veining. Also more studies focussed on the spatial scale of individual landscape elements than on the farm or landscape scale, which may be caused by the large number of studies focussing on plant or invertebrate species. Species living at larger spatial scales, e.g. mammals and birds were not often studied at the level of green veining elements as they also use agricultural fields as part of their habitat. We could not verify the species–area relation for green veining, nor the effect of amount, spatial configuration or management intensity on this relation, because only few studies quantified the found effects and no studies were found on the effect of management intensity or spatial configuration on the species–area curve in green veining. We addressed the most important challenges for future field and model research in order to fill the identified gaps in knowledge. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Spatial adjacencies are a key-issue in environmental studies. Adjacency effects have been amply observed for biotic (plants and animals) and abiotic components of ecosystems. Particularly well-documented are the effects from human manufactures onto the contiguous vegetation mosaics of natural and semi-natural areas. In this work we first propose and reformulate association rules analysis (ARA), a relatively new data mining algorithm with very limited scientific applications so far, in the form of an in-depth investigation method of the spatial pattern of landcover and vegetation maps. We applied ARA to two very different study areas in Northern Italy, the first (Ceno valley) having a substantial human footprint and mapped at 1:25,000 scale, the second (Foses valley) being almost natural and mapped at 1:5000 scale. We were able to: (a) detect the entire network of spatial adjacencies among landcover types and (b) quantify the frequency and strength of detected adjacencies. Based on our spatial analysis, we also advanced hypotheses on both natural and man-driven vegetation dynamics. In addition, ARA allowed us to propose an index of naturality based on the discovered contiguities. Results show the skill of the proposed approach to characterize landcover spatial patterns for both mid-resolution and high-resolution maps. Furthermore the proposed approach bears a general interest, since it can be applied to the analysis of any landcover map. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Gaussian processes are a fundamental statistical tool used in a wide range of applications. In the spatiotemporal setting, several families of covariance functions exist to accommodate a wide variety of dependence structures arising in different applications. These parametric families can be restrictive and are insufficient in some situations. In contrast, process convolutions represent a flexible, interpretable approach to defining the covariance of a Gaussian process and have modest requirements to ensure validity. We introduce a generalization of the process convolution approach that employs multiple convolutions sequentially to form a “process convolution chain”. In our proposed multistage framework, complex dependencies that arise from a combination of different interacting mechanisms are decomposed into a series of interpretable kernel smoothers. We demonstrate an application of process convolution chains to model killer whale movement, in which the paths taken by multiple individuals are not independent but reflect dynamic social interactions within the population. Our proposed model for dependent movement provides inference for the latent dynamic social structure in the study population. Additionally, by leveraging the positive dependence among individual paths, we achieve a reduction in uncertainty for the estimated locations of the killer whales, compared with a model that treats paths as independent.

AB  - Successful animal systems often manage risk through synchronous behavior that spontaneously arises without leadership. In critical human systems facing risk, such as financial markets or military operations, our understanding of the benefits associated with synchronicity is nascent but promising. Building on previous work illuminating commonalities between ecological and human systems, we compare the activity patterns of individual financial traders with the simultaneous activity of other traders—an individual and spontaneous characteristic we call synchronous trading. Additionally, we examine the association of synchronous trading with individual performance and communication patterns. Analyzing empirical data on day traders' second-to-second trading and instant messaging, we find that the higher the traders' synchronous trading is, the less likely they are to lose money at the end of the day. We also find that the daily instant messaging patterns of traders are closely associated with their level of synchronous trading. This result suggests that synchronicity and vanguard technology may help traders cope with risky decisions in complex systems and may furnish unique prospects for achieving collective and individual goals.

AB  - The article presents information on how animals in cartoons were used to address the political and cultural contests at the heart of conservation. Cartoon animals serve particularly well as markers of political change as they always have occupied a special place in human imagination, and as images they become embodiments of nature that easily absorb human characteristics. As historical artifacts, cartoons frequently focus complex moral, social and political connections into a simple image that dramatically reveals a defining moment in the evolution of a political issue. It is an 1874, Thomas Nast drew a cartoon entitled 'The Last Buffalo,' just as hide hunters began their rush to the Great Plains that resulted in near-extermination of the most abundant large mammal in North America. The title of the cartoon suggests that the failure to halt the rush to convert nature to private profit makes the public a fool or a villain. In 1874, the journal 'Harpers Weekly,' called for an end to the 'indiscriminate slaughter.' (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - The Clicking Stream Frog (Strongylopus grayii) occurs throughout southern and eastern South Africa across summer, aseasonal and winter rainfall areas. Because of its contiguous distribution and extended breeding season this species might be expected to show a phylogeographic pattern of isolation by distance rather than divergent geographical lineages. To investigate population structure and make inferences about physical processes that have influenced gene flow in this species, two mitochondrial genes (ND2 and 16S) were sequenced for 64 frogs from across the distribution of the species. Phylogenetic analyses (parsimony and Bayesian) revealed two well-supported clades partitioning the range of this taxon, with one clade restricted to the northeast (summer rainfall) and the other restricted to the south (winter and aseasonal rainfall). The magnitude of sequence divergence between these clades is higher than expected, and is typical of levels of sequence divergence found among closely related species of pyxicephalid frogs. Phylogeographic analyses of sequence networks and spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) revealed additional geographical structure within each of these lineages. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of climatic transitions as barriers to gene flow and as potential agents for vicariant speciation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Networks are collections of units that potentially interact as a system. Electronic power grids, human societies, the Internet, food webs and metabolic pathways are examples of networks that have emergent properties that allow all vertices (viz. individuals, components, species, etc.) to be linked by a short chain of intermediate vertices. My field observations on a colony of 65 free-ranging Columbian ground squirrels suggest that their society also exhibits these characteristics via social interaction. On average, any dyad of squirrels in the colony can be connected via amicable interaction with three intermediate individuals. The connectivity of individuals (viz. the number of individuals to which an individual is directly connected) decays following a scale-free power law distribution. Individuals that have similar age, reproductive status and number of associates (viz. the number of individuals to which the individual is connected via social interaction) interact amicably with each other more than other squirrels. The network is robust to the removal of random individuals. However, simulated removal of individuals that are connected to many other squirrels increases the number of intermediates between two random individuals and fragments the network into smaller clusters when removals exceed 10% of the individuals in the colony. Thus, certain individuals appear to play more central roles than others in the cohesion of the network. My results reinforce previous studies showing that network theory can be used to determine the roles played by individuals in the cohesion of animal societies, thus providing a framework for studying sociality across species.

AB  - The anatomy of the corpus callosum has been described in considerable detail. Tracing studies in animals and human postmortem experiments are currently complemented by diffusion-weighted imaging, which enables noninvasive investigations of callosal connectivity to be conducted. In contrast to the wealth of anatomical data, little is known about the principles by which interhemispheric integration is mediated by callosal connections. Most importantly, we lack insights into the mechanisms that determine the functional role of callosal connections in a context-dependent fashion. These mechanisms can now be disclosed by models of effective connectivity that explain neuroimaging data from paradigms that manipulate interhemispheric interactions. In this article, we demonstrate that dynamic causal modeling (DCM), in conjunction with Bayesian model selection (BMS), is a powerful approach to disentangling the various factors that determine the functional role of callosal connections. We first review the theoretical foundations of DCM and BMS before demonstrating the application of these techniques to empirical data from a single subject. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - 1. Natal dispersal has the potential to affect most ecological and evolutionary processes. However, despite its importance, this complex ecological process still represents a significant gap in our understanding of animal ecology due to both the lack of empirical data and the intrinsic complexity of dispersal dynamics. 2. By studying natal dispersal of 74 radiotagged juvenile eagle owls Bubo bubo (Linnaeus), in both the wandering and the settlement phases, we empirically addressed the complex interactions by which individual phenotypic traits and external cues jointly shape individual heterogeneity through the different phases of dispersal, both at nightly and weekly temporal scales. 3. Owls in poorer physical conditions travelled shorter total distances during the wandering phase, describing straighter paths and moving slower, especially when crossing heterogeneous habitats. In general, the owls in worse condition started dispersal later and took longer times to find further settlement areas. Net distances were also sex biased, with females settling at further distances. Dispersing individuals did not seem to explore wandering and settlement areas by using a search image of their natal surroundings. Eagle owls showed a heterogeneous pattern of patch occupancy, where few patches were highly visited by different owls whereas the majority were visited by just one individual. During dispersal, the routes followed by owls were an intermediate solution between optimized and randomized ones. Finally, dispersal direction had a marked directionality, largely influenced by dominant winds. These results suggest an asymmetric and anisotropic dispersal pattern, where not only the number of patches but also their functions can affect population viability. 4. The combination of the information coming from the relationships among a large set of factors acting and integrating at different spatial and temporal scales, under the perspective of heterogeneous life histories, are a fruitful ground for future understanding of natal dispersal.

AB  - In 2004, Natalie Lloyd and Jane Mulcock initiated the Australian Animals & Society Study Group, a network of social science, humanities and arts scholars that quickly grew to include more than 100 participants. In July 2005, about 50 participants attended the group's 4-day inaugural conference at the University of Western Australia, Perth. Papers in this issue emerged from the conference. They exemplify the Australian academy's work in the fields of History, Population Health, Sociology, Geography, and English and address strong themes: human-equine relationships; management of native and introduced animals; and relationships with other domestic, nonhuman animals—from cats and dogs to cattle. Human-Animal Studies is an expanding field in Australia. However, many scholars, due to funding and teaching concerns, focus their primary research in different domains. All authors in this issue—excepting one—are new scholars in their respective fields. The papers represent the diversity and innovation of recent Australian research on human-animal interactions. The authors look at both past and present, then anticipate future challenges in building an effective network to expand this field of study in Australia. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Human impacts to aquatic ecosystems often involve changes in hydrologic connectivity and flow regime. Drawing upon examples in the literature and from our experience, we developed conceptual models and used simple bivariate plots to visualize human impacts and restoration efforts in terms of connectivity and flow dynamics. Human-induced changes in longitudinal, lateral, and vertical connectivity are often accompanied by changes in flow dynamics, but in our experience restoration efforts to date have more often restored connectivity than flow dynamics. Restoration actions have included removing dams to restore fish passage, reconnecting flow through artificially cut-off side channels, setting back or breaching levees, and removing fine sediment deposits that block vertical exchange with the bed, thereby partially restoring hydrologic connectivity, i.e., longitudinal, lateral, or vertical. Restorations have less commonly affected flow dynamics, presumably because of the social and economic importance of water diversions or flood control. Thus, as illustrated in these bivariate plots, the trajectories of ecological restoration are rarely parallel with degradation trajectories because restoration is politically and economically easier along some axes more than others.

AB  - It is well established that predators can scare as well as consume their prey. In many systems, the fear of being eaten causes trait-mediated cascades whose strength can rival or exceed that of more widely recognized density-mediated cascades transmitted by predators that consume their prey. Despite this progress it is only beginning to be understood how the influence of predation risk is shaped by environmental context and whether it can exert an important influence on ecosystem-level processes. This study used a factorial mesocosm experiment that manipulated basal-resource identity (either barnacles, Seini balanus balanoides, or mussels, Mytilus edulis) to determine how resources modify the influence of predation. risk, cascade strength, and the efficiency of energy transfer in two, tritrophic, rocky-shore food chains containing the predatory green crab (Carcinus inaenas) and an intermediate consumer (the snail, Nucella lapillus). The effect of predation risk and the strength of trait-mediated cascades (both in absolute and relative terms) were much stronger in the barnacle than in the mussel food chain. Moreover, predation risk strongly diminished the efficiency of energy transfer in the barnacle food chain but had no significant effect in the mussel food chain. The influence of resource identity on indirect-effect strength and energy transfer was likely caused by differences in how each resource shapes the degree of risk perceived by prey. We suggest that our understanding of the connection between trophic dynamics and ecosystem functioning will improve considerably once the effects of predation risk on individual behavior and physiology are considered.

However, advances in the understanding of generalities across ecosystem types are impeded to a considerable extent by a methodological dichotomy contrasting a considerable portion of marine ecology on the one hand opposite to traditional community ecology on the other hand. Many marine ecologists are bound to the taxonomy-neglecting size spectrum approach when describing and analysing community patterns. In contrast, the mindset of the other school is focused on taxonomies according to the Linnean system at the cost of obscuring information due to applying species or population averages of body masses and other traits. Following other pioneering studies, we addressed this lingering gap, and studied non-linear interaction strengths (i.e. functional responses) between two taxonomically-distinct terrestrial arthropod predators (centipedes and spiders) of varying individual body masses and their prey. We fitted three non-linear functional response models to the data: (1) a taxonomic model not accounting for variance in body masses amongst predator individuals, (2) an allometric model ignoring taxonomic differences between predator individuals, and (3) a combined model including body mass and taxonomic effects. Ranked according to their AICs, the combined model performs better than the allometric model, which provides a superior fit to the data than the taxonomic model. These results strongly indicate that the body masses of predator and prey individuals were responsible for most of the variation in non-linear interaction strengths. Taxonomy explained some specific patterns in allometric exponents between groups and revealed mechanistic insights in predation efficiencies. Reconciling quantitative allometric models as employed by the marine size-spectrum approach with taxonomic information may thus yield quantitative results that are generalized across ecosystem types and taxonomic groups. Using these quantitative models as novel null models should also strengthen subsequent taxonomic analyses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Effective involvement and equity in participation between men and women and the various community groups are likely to influence the equity in the sharing of the development outcomes of any participatory research project. The CARUSO project, a participatory research based on the ecosystem approach to human health, showed that the inhabitants from Brasilia Legal, a small village located on the river banks of the Tapajós river in the Brazilian Amazon, are exposed to mercury through fish consumption; a subsequent participatory intervention based on dietary changes was effective in reducing mercury exposure of the population. In the present study, we focus on equity in participation and analyze the discussion network about mercury and health to measure individual and group involvement in the community. Participation in the discussion network is associated with the awareness of the critical information necessary to allow the individual to change dietary habits toward the preferential consumption of the less contaminated fish species. Our network analysis shows that gender, age, religion, education, subsistence activities, and spatial distribution of the houses are key elements affecting the involvement of the population in discussions about mercury and health. Based on these results, we propose strategies for integrating the research results and the knowledge of the villagers in a new cycle of participatory research in order to address the lack of involvement of some groups and to promote equitable participation and benefit sharing.

AB  - Twenty-five model food webs can be designed from five points (species) and five links (trophic interactions), if they contain a single top-predator (i.e. sink webs). According to a simple topological approach, we presented elsewhere a reliability theoretical analysis of this set of food web graphs. The question addressed here is how network flow reliability is related to the dynamical behavior and stability of these ‘model communities’. We simulated the behavior of these webs and calculated their persistence, according to four models: (1) with symmetrical interaction coefficients between species; (2) with asymmetrical interaction coefficients and lower death rates for predators; and (3) with absolutely and (4) relatively perturbed, formerly persistent parameter sets of the asymmetrical model. We used both Lotka–Volterra (LV) and Holling II-type equations (with switching effect). Thus, we had eight persistence values for each web. Persistence (a dynamical property) and flow reliability (a structural property) were analyzed. We found that (1) reliable flow pattern is associated with high persistence in the Holling models, while the LV models predict no consistent correlations; (2) in asymmetrical situations, persistence is always much higher (in both LV and Holling models); and (3) the predictions of Holling models (versus LV models) are much less sensitive to local perturbations. Based on these results, we conclude that (1) reliable network flows can contribute to persistence only if switching is possible; (2) asymmetrical interactions increase persistence, independently of the switching effect but it indicates persistence in Holling II model; (3) switching makes the relationship much more predictable between structure and dynamics. Thus, the network design is less useful predictor of persistence without switching effect but well can ensure dynamical stability under the conditions of the Holling II model. We have presented how various dynamical models predict different behavior of modelled communities characterized by the same structure and complexity. Complementing dynamical with structural analysis may further increase our understanding of persistence in food webs. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - We assessed the composition of spider and carabid beetle assemblages along river banks from the Common Meuse (Belgium) to determine their relationships with local topographical and landscape-related characteristics. Data were gathered with pitfall traps in 1998 and explored by ordination and grouping methods. Our analysis revealed that the presence of xerothermic spider species was limited to scarcely covered, less dynamic gravel banks. Riparian spider species were found on frequently flooded as well as on rather elevated and high gravel banks, while riparian carabid beetles were dominant on all sampled banks. The level of flooding disturbance, the vegetation density and the presence of silt appeared to be the most important environmental determinants of spider and carabid beetle assemblage structure. Consequently, local environmental factors influence species occurrence patterns in a similar way for the two investigated arthropod groups. Nevertheless, distinct ecological groups are differently ordered along the prime environmental gradients. Nature management should therefore consider the conservation, restoration and connectivity of both dynamic and more elevated banks in order to obtain a high degree of local and regional heterogeneity throughout the river system.

AB  - We have conducted a series of simulations to determine the effects of competitive networks and hierarchies on species abundance patterns. We have restricted our attention to situations involving spatial competition among sessile, colonial invertebrates in the absence of disturbance. Variables in this model include overgrowth ranking patterns, recruitment rates, growth rates, overgrowth rates, substratum size (i.e. size of a spatial array), and species number. In terms of species richness, complex networks > simple networks > hierarchies. A large range in recruitment rates greatly reduced species richness in simple network simulations due to the decreased frequency of encounters between the lowest- and highest-ranked species forming the network loops. Reduction in substratum size had a similar effect on species richness and also reduced the predictability of species recruitment. Increases in species number (size of available pool) reduced species richness in simple network simulations, again due to reduced encounter frequencies, but also increased species richness in complex network simulations. A large range in overgrowth rates drastically reduced species richness in complex network simulations. The spatial array in these simulations was not always dominated by the species with the highest overgrowth rate, indicating the importance of "position effects" as well as "growth effects." It is suggested that network situations should strongly favor the selection for mechanisms which inhibit rates of overgrowth and which allow lower ranked species to find favorable locations (i.e., refuges) such as small substrata or sites adjacent to higher ranked species which they can overgrow.

AB  - To perform nontrivial, real-time computations on a sensory input stream, biological systems must retain a short-term memory trace of their recent inputs. It has been proposed that generic high-dimensional dynamical systems could retain a memory trace for past inputs in their current state. This raises important questions about the fundamental limits of such memory traces and the properties required of dynamical systems to achieve these limits. We address these issues by applying Fisher information theory to dynamical systems driven by time-dependent signals corrupted by noise. We introduce the Fisher Memory Curve (FMC) as a measure of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) embedded in the dynamical state relative to the input SNR. The integrated FMC indicates the total memory capacity. We apply this theory to linear neuronal net- works and show that the capacity of networks with normal connectivity matrices is exactly 1 and that of any network of N neurons is, at most, N. A nonnormal network achieving this bound is subject to stringent design constraints: It must have a hidden feed forward architecture that super linearly amplifies its input for a time of order N, and the input connectivity must optimally match this architecture. The memory capacity of networks subject to saturating non-linearities is further limited, and cannot exceed &%#x221A;N. This limit can be realized by feed forward structures with divergent fan out that distributes the signal across neurons, thereby avoiding saturation. We illustrate the generality of the theory by showing that memory in fluid systems can be sustained by transient non- normal amplification due to convective instability or the onset of turbulence.

AB  - Summary Humans are intrinsically social animals, forming enduring affiliative bonds [ 1 ]. However, a striking minority with psychopathic traits, who present with violent and antisocial behaviors, tend to value other people only insofar as they contribute to their own advancement [ 2, 3 ]. Extant research has addressed the neurocognitive processes associated with aggression in such individuals, but we know remarkably little about processes underlying their atypical social affiliation. This is surprising, given the importance of affiliation and bonding in promoting social order and reducing aggression [ 4, 5 ]. Human laughter engages brain areas that facilitate social reciprocity and emotional resonance, consistent with its established role in promoting affiliation and social cohesion [ 6–8 ]. We show that, compared with typically developing boys, those at risk for antisocial behavior in general (irrespective of their risk of psychopathy) display reduced neural response to laughter in the supplementary motor area, a premotor region thought to facilitate motor readiness to join in during social behavior [ 9–11 ]. Those at highest risk for developing psychopathy additionally show reduced neural responses to laughter in the anterior insula. This region is implicated in auditory-motor processing and in linking action tendencies with emotional experience and subjective feelings [ 10, 12, 13 ]. Furthermore, this same group reports reduced desire to join in with the laughter of others—a behavioral profile in part accounted for by the attenuated anterior insula response. These findings suggest that atypical processing of laughter could represent a novel mechanism that impoverishes social relationships and increases risk for psychopathy and antisocial behavior.

AB  - Reciprocal altruism has been proposed as a possible mechanism for the evolution of cooperative behaviour. However, very few investigations have tested predictions of reciprocity in wild animal populations. In the current investigation we simulated defection during predator inspection in a wild population of guppies, Poecilia reticulata. Two experiments were run: the first simulating defection during a single exposure to a predator and the second during multiple exposures to a predator. We then compared subsequent social and cooperative interactions with those observed prior to the treatments. From theory and previous experiments on cooperation and reciprocity, we predicted that defection would result in a reduction in social and cooperative interactions during subsequent predator inspections. However, our experiments did not find any effect of simulated defection(s) on the subsequent social structure, or on patterns of predator inspection behaviour. We discuss the potential reasons for the observed results and suggest future directions for research to address mechanisms underpinning the nature of cooperative interactions during predator inspection.

AB  - Sensory input plays a major role in controlling motor responses during most behavioral tasks. The vestibular organs in the marine mollusk Clione, the statocysts, react to the external environment and continuously adjust the tail and wing motor neurons to keep the animal oriented vertically. However, we suggested previously that during hunting behavior, the intrinsic dynamics of the statocyst network produce a spatiotemporal pattern that may control the motor system independently of environmental cues. Once the response is triggered externally, the collective activation of the statocyst neurons produces a complex sequential signal. In the behavioral context of hunting, such network dynamics may be the main determinant of an intricate spatial behavior. Here, we show that (1) during fictive hunting, the population activity of the statocyst receptors is correlated positively with wing and tail motor output suggesting causality, (2) that fictive hunting can be evoked by electrical stimulation of the statocyst network, and (3) that removal of even a few individual statocyst receptors critically changes the fictive hunting motor pattern. These results indicate that the intrinsic dynamics of a sensory network, even without its normal cues, can organize a motor program vital for the survival of the animal. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract Plant–animal mutualistic networks are interaction webs consisting of two sets of entities, plant and animal species, whose evolutionary dynamics are deeply influenced by the outcomes of the interactions, yielding a diverse array of coevolutionary processes. These networks are two-mode networks sharing many common properties with others such as food webs, social, and abiotic networks. Here we describe generalized patterns in the topology of 29 plant–pollinator and 24 plant–frugivore networks in natural communities. Scale-free properties have been described for a number of biological, social, and abiotic networks; in contrast, most of the plant–animal mutualistic networks (65.6%) show species connectivity distributions (number of links per species) with a power-law regime but decaying as a marked cut-off, i.e. truncated power-law or broad-scale networks and few (22.2%) show scale-invariance. We hypothesize that plant–animal mutualistic networks follow a build-up process similar to complex abiotic nets, based on the preferential attachment of species. However, constraints in the addition of links such as morphological mismatching or phenological uncoupling between mutualistic partners, restrict the number of interactions established, causing deviations from scale-invariance. This reveals generalized topological patterns characteristic of self-organized complex systems. Relative to scale-invariant networks, such constraints may confer higher robustness to the loss of keystone species that are the backbone of these webs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this computational work,we investigated gamma-band synchronization across cortical circuits associated with selective attention. The model explicitly instantiates a reciprocally connected loop of spiking neurons between a sensory-type (area MT) and an executive-type (prefrontal/ parietal) cortical circuit (the source area for top-down attentional signaling). Moreover, unlike models in which neurons behave as clock-like oscillators, in our model single-cell firing is highly irregular (close to Poisson), while local field potential exhibits a population rhythm. In this "sparsely synchronized oscillation" regime, the model reproduces and clarifies multiple observations from behaving animals. Top-down attentional inputs have a profound effect on network oscillatory dynamics while only modestly affecting single-neuron spiking statistics. In addition, attentional synchrony modulations are highly selective: interareal neuronal coherence occurs only when there is a close match between the preferred feature of neurons, the attended feature, and the presented stimulus, a prediction that is experimentally testable. When interareal coherence was abolished, attention-induced gain modulations of sensory neurons were slightly reduced. Therefore, our model reconciles the rate and synchronization effects, and suggests that interareal coherence contributes to large-scale neuronal computation in the brain through modest enhancement of rate modulations as well as a pronounced attention-specific enhancement of neural synchrony.

AB  - Conserving habitat for migratory birds presents a unique set of challenges, because multiple reserves distributed across space are required for complete protection of single species. We developed the Flight Leg Allocation Problem (FLAP), a distance-constrained shortest path problem, to identify optimal configurations of stopover habitats for migratory bird conservation. FLAP is based on a relational network topology model, where stopovers are represented as nodes and potential pathways by links. FLAP finds the optimal migratory pathway that consists of the fewest number of stops in the shortest distance, given that flocks of birds are limited by maximum daily flight capabilities and constrained by carrying capacities of individual habitats. We first present the FLAP model formulation and describe results of an empirical test for a large wetland dataset under different climatic conditions. Our results illustrate how migratory birds might respond to changes in both the temporal and spatial distribution of available stopovers. We also discuss conservation implications for using FLAP to identify priority sites for migratory birds in nature reserve networks. Additionally, the methods presented in this paper may be useful for modelling other types of spatially and temporally dynamic networks. (Author) (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - Spatial structure regulates and modifies processes at several levels of ecological organization (e.g. individual/genetic, population and community) and is thus a key component of complex systems, where knowledge at a small scale can be insufficient for understanding system behaviour at a larger scale. Recent syntheses outline potential applications of network theory to ecological systems, but do not address the implications of physical structure for network dynamics. There is a specific need to examine how dendritic habitat structure, such as that found in stream, hedgerow and cave networks, influences ecological processes. Although dendritic networks are one type of ecological network, they are distinguished by two fundamental characteristics: (1) both the branches and the nodes serve as habitat, and (2) the specific spatial arrangement and hierarchical organization of these elements interacts with a species' movement behaviour to alter patterns of population distribution and abundance, and community interactions. Here, we summarize existing theory relating to ecological dynamics in dendritic networks, review empirical studies examining the population- and community-level consequences of these networks, and suggest future research integrating spatial pattern and processes in dendritic systems.

AB  - Abstract: Livestock movement data represent a valuable source of information to understand the pattern of contacts between premises which may determine the spread of diseases. Social network analysis techniques have been used to analyse the movement patterns of cattle in Italy in 2007. A description of the structure of the Italian cattle industry is presented and the main trade flows and the relations between premises in relation to the potential spread of cattle diseases are investigated. Epidemic simulations have been carried out on the network build out of movement data using a network-based meta-population model. The simulations show the influence of the network structure on the dynamics and size of a hypothetic epidemic and give useful indications on the effects of targeted removal of nodes based on the centrality of premises within the network of animal movements.

AB  - Protected areas in Thailand were first established 40 years ago. The total area of existing protected areas covers 18.2% of the country's land area and the Class 1 Watershed, another form of protection, encompasses 18.1%. The government of Thailand intends to increase protected area systems to 25% of the country in 2006 and 30% in 2016. There are always questions arising about how much is enough protected areas to effectively protect biodiversity. The objective of this article is to assess the representation of ecosystems in the protected area network. This article also recommends which underrepresented ecosystems should be added to fill the gaps in representativeness. The research applies a gap analysis and a comparison index to assess the representation of ecosystems within the protected area network. The spatial analyses were applied to measure three aspects of representativeness, namely forest type, altitude, and natural land system. The analyses indicate that the existing protected area system covers 24.4% of the country's land area, nearly meeting the 25% target proposed by the National Forest Policy; and 83.8% of these areas are under forest cover. Most protected areas are situated in high altitudes, where biological diversity is less than in lowlands. Mangrove forest and riparian floodplain are extremely underrepresented in the existing system. Peat swamp forest, dry dipterocarp forest, and beach forest are relatively well represented. In addition, these five ecosystems are threatened by human pressures and natural disasters; therefore, they should be targeted as high priorities for the selection of new reserves. Future research should incorporate aquatic and marine ecosystems, as well as animal distributions, which were not included in this research due to data unavailabilities.

AB  - Protected areas in Thailand were first established 40 years ago. The total area of existing protected areas covers 18.2% of the country’s land area and the Class 1 Watershed, another form of protection, encompasses 18.1%. The government of Thailand intends to increase protected area systems to 25% of the country in 2006 and 30% in 2016. There are always questions arising about how much is enough protected areas to effectively protect biodiversity. The objective of this article is to assess the representation of ecosystems in the protected area network. This article also recommends which underrepresented ecosystems should be added to fill the gaps in representativeness. The research applies a gap analysis and a comparison index to assess the representation of ecosystems within the protected area network.

AB  - The authors report the results of an experiment on patchy populations of the root vole aimed at testing the predicted scenarios of space use change to habitat fragmentation. They manipulated three factors in a factorial design: fragment size, interfragment connectivity, and intrinsic social behavior. Space use responses were examined for 184 root voles, and treatments were replicated at the level of local populations. The results support the hypothesis that predicts fusion and fission responses based on intrinsic social mechanisms in patchy populations. klf (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - This article addresses a countermovement to the animal liberation movement and its campaigns against vivisection, factory farming, and recreational hunting in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. As moderate welfarists, pragmatic animal liberationists (Singer 1975), and radical abolitionists who advocate animal rights, animal protectionists campaign for animals. The countermovement defends acts that animal protectionists decry. Meanwhile, sociologists accord little study to interplay between the movements (Meyer & Staggenborg, 1996). In Buechler's and Cylke's collection of 34 papers on social movements (1997), only one paper focused on countermovements, describing the connection between social movement and countermovement as “a continuous dialect of social change” (Mottl, 1980). Although extensive writings exist on the main campaigns of the animal liberation movement, little scholarly material exists on the defenses mounted by the countermovement. This article examines key elements of a values war, a struggle over moral capital waged by animal protectionists and their countermovement opponents. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Culturally transmitted traits are observed in a wide array of animal species, yet we understand little about the costs of the behavioural patterns that underlie culture, such as innovation and social learning. We propose that infectious diseases are a significant cost associated with cultural transmission. We investigated two hypotheses that may explain such a connection: that social learning and exploratory behaviours (specifically, innovation and extractive foraging) either compensate for existing infection or increase exposure to infectious agents. We used Bayesian comparative methods, controlling for sampling effort, body mass, group size, geographical range size, terrestriality, latitude and phylogenetic uncertainty. Across 127 primate species, we found a positive association between pathogen richness and rates of innovation, extractive foraging and social learning. This relationship was driven by two independent phenomena: socially contagious diseases were positively associated with rates of social learning, and environmentally transmitted diseases were positively associated with rates of exploration. Because higher pathogen burdens can contribute to morbidity and mortality, we propose that parasitism is a significant cost associated with the behavioural patterns that underpin culture, and that increased pathogen exposure is likely to have played an important role in the evolution of culture in both non-human primates and humans.

AB  - Here the authors report a case study of the successful treatment of stress-induced, self-mutilating behaviour using both a drug and environmental enrichments. In June 1999, a family group of eight Geoffroy's tufted-ear marmosets, Callithrix geoffroyi, arrived at the Reserve Africaine de Sigean. The breeding pair consisted of a four year old male and an eight year old female. They had six offspring aged from three months (a male and a female) to 27 months (a male). Two months after their arrival, the adult female gave birth to twins, a male and a female. The alpha female died in December 1999. Five months after her death, her three year old son was regularly attacked by the breeding male and the oldest son. As a result, the attacked male withdrew to a corner of the room on the floor, even though many refuge boxes were available within the room. A wound at the base of his tail was detected a month after the attack. This wound was the consequence of stress-induced, self-mutilating behaviour. To overcome the acute phase of this stress, 1.3 mg of a neuroleptic, Largactil ND (Chlorpromazine), was given to the male each morning on a cake. Progressively and very steadily, the male was reintegrated into the group and resumed grooming some members of it. After 40 days of treatment, the wound had healed and hair had started to regrow over it. It was decided to stop the treatment progressively after play behaviour resumed and the two oldest males groomed him. However, in parallel with the medical treatment, several changes were made in the environment. Provence reeds (Arundo donax) and branches of ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior) were regularly put in the cage to provide visual barriers and numerous hiding-places. Living insects, both adult and young crickets (Gryllus campestris) and mealworms (Tennebrio molitor), were also introduced. The self-mutilating behaviour and the wound totally disappeared, even though the drug was no longer administrated. The combination of the medical and environmental interventions enabled the rapid psychological recovery of the male who was maintained in his group during all the procedures, despite the original disruption of his social network (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - [unedited] Housing wild species in captivity raises the issue of matching the living conditions of the captive animal and its welfare. How an enclosure is structured, apart from its size, is probably an essential key in this matching process. This concept was applied to the remodelling of outdoor enclosures for primates at the zoological park, the Parc de la Tête d'Or, in Lyon. This remodelling was the result of a multidisciplinary approach involving veterinarians, ethologists and landscape designers. In addition, animal caretakers participated in the discussions. Before the remodelling process, recurrent pathologies and behavioural disorders were observed. They were probably signs of impaired welfare. Our first step consisted of determining which biotic and non-biotic factors might influence the welfare of each individual. Then a new kind of enclosure was conceived, based on knowledge of the behaviour of the species in the wild, observation of the behaviour of the animals in their previous enclosures and the results of experimental studies demonstrating the influence of the structure of the enclosure on social networks. The concepts that emerged from this brainstorming were incorporated into the design of the enclosure by a landscape designer. The design took into account the possibility of remodelling the previous enclosures and the constraints of primate maintenance and security. The design also took into account needs specific to zoological parks. In agreement with our working process, the enclosure was designed specifically for the primates that were to be housed in it. The preliminary results of a scientific of the influence of the restructuring of the enclosure on the monkeys' behaviours show a clear-cut improvement in social relationships in the four primate species concerned (i.e. grey-cheeked mangabeys, Lophocebus albigena, capuchins, Cebus capucinus, mona monkeys, Cercopithecus mona, and squirrel monkeys, Saimiri sciureus). In addition, there was a general decrease in the psychological tension level and an increased tolerance of the public by the animals. The results also underline the fact that the activities of the monkeys could express their species specific behaviours better. Consequently the satisfaction of the public was greatly improved. It is worth underlining that the immediate evaluation of the effect of a new design on the monkeys' behaviour should be continued by a daily follow-up. This should be a joint effort of a veterinarian trained in behavioural studies and an ethologist (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - Available data on social aging in nonhuman primates are conflicting and limited to females. We obtained 624 hours of observational data on Cayo Santiago during 1997-8 to investigate the relationship between chronological age and social behavior in male and female (n=42) rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). These data are used to examine age and sex-based individual and group social behaviors by age cohort. Female (n=24) social behavior received (r=-.38, p=.04) and directed (r=-.42, p=.04) are both negatively correlated with age. In males (n=18), age and social behavior, both received (r=.55, p=.04) and directed (r=.50, p=.04), are positively correlated. Females show a negative correlation between age and network size (r=-.64, p=.0007), and age and time in social contact (r=-.43, p=.04). Males show a low positive correlation between age and network size (r=.35, p=.155), but a substantial correlation between age and time in social contact (r=.50, p=.034). This suggests that while females are increasingly less social with advancing age, males may be increasingly more social. In addition, qualitative changes may occur in social networks over the lifespan. Females of all ages spend the majority of their total social contact time with daughters. Young and middle-aged males spend the majoritiy of their time with adult females. 'Aged' males spend 80% of their social time with infants and yearlings. These results illustrate age and sex-based differences in male and female social behaviors. These social behaviors also vary by dominance rank and relatedness of partners (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - [unedited] Leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea), known locally as Tabob, are the most important marine species indigenous people at several villages in the Kei Kecil Islands (called Nu Fit) for serving subsistent and ritual needs. Despite catastrophic declines in Pacific leatherback turtle numbers (Spotila et al. 1996) and strict laws prohibiting their use and accidental catch in fisheries, this species remains a part of the traditions and cultural identity of the Nu Fit. Substantial advancements in scientific studies provide critical information for protection strategies, but are often difficult to apply when dealing with deeply rooted traditional beliefs. The final decision on conservation is often in the hands of people acting in their own benefit, as well as in a way that is perceived to benefit the turtles. Building trust through friendships and sharing on community issues, values, and beliefs (knowledge) was the first step taken when this initiative started. Monitoring involving hunters is a form of people engagement in conservation activities, and by involving hunters we were able to gather information on the numbers, locations and seasonality of turtles killed. This continuous process over two years has led to a better understanding of the sociocultural relationship between people, leatherback turtles, and hunting dynamics, including which groups and/or families are principally involved and under what circumstances leatherbacks are killed. Scientific knowledge on turtle biology, status, and community conservation initiatives elsewhere were later shared with communities using popular media such as video presentations, booklets, displays and informal conversations including discussing the relationship between science and local perceptions of the fate of the leatherback as a species. Connecting Nu Fit people with other communities and individuals involved in conservation was considered important. To this end, visits by scientists from the US National Marine Fisheries Service and other conservation scientists, as well as cross-visits with Nu Fit representatives to nesting beach and community patrols in Papua New Guinea were sponsored. Conservation results from those approaches showed behavior changes in some individual villages and individual hunter/groups in giving up hunting practices and the consumption of leatherback meat. Hunting monitoring activity recorded that only two out of nine hunting villages have the highest hunting intensity. However, this result did not necessarily impact the number of turtles hunted. It was later observed that leatherback issues were very much related to the power within the communities (customary governance versus legal governance), thus conservation efforts might create potential conflict between groups of people in power, especially in the case of these two villages. Aiming at the short-term objective to reduce hunting activities by influencing people to redirect time and energy to other popular activities (e,g football/soccer competition, Nu Fit festival) and the longterm objectives to institute a management mechanism for local enforcement, adaptive management will be used to maintain flexibility. This approach includes promoting non-consumptive use of the species, the involvement of people in research and monitoring, marine eco-tourism and education. Continuous process of building understanding on the foraging ecology of leatherback turtles, implementing effective ways to reduce social conflict and connecting people with outsiders to share experiences and knowledge are fundamental approaches for this conservation initiative (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - Controversy has surrounded the question of why lek-breeding has evolved in certain ungulate species. Can the behavior be explained simply by males mapping onto a female distribution that is determined by factors unrelated to mating? Or are leks created because estrous females distinguish between males and favor males who cluster? Here I address these questions by looking at spatial distribution in lekking topi antelopes (Damaliscus lunatus). Contrary to the predictions of a model assuming male clustering in the zone of maximum female range overlap, territories were highly clustered also within this zone, and lek size correlated positively with population density. In support of models derived from the ideal free distribution of males onto female dispersion, leks were in areas with high female density during the rut. However, models not taking into account both individual variation in male quality and female mate preferences failed to explain the extreme male clumping also within high density areas, which was revealed by a strongly male-biased sex-ratio on leks. Additional support for the female preference-based model came from the finding that estrous females concentrated onto leks. Female preference for clustered males may develop if males initially follow an ideal free distribution of unequal competitors with high quality males slightly clustered at density hotspots; positive feedback between female benefits of preference for clustered males and male benefits of clustering could lead to contraction of the territorial network and lek behavior. Thus only the female preference-based model correctly predicted a negative correlation between male mating rate and resource density (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - [unedited] New management strategies for detecting social instabilities and promoting social cohesion are needed to reduce aggression-based morbidity and mortality among captive groups of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). This study determined the utility of social network theory for deciphering patterns of aggression and wounding in rhesus macaques. Over 37,000 observations of affiliative, submissive and aggressive activities were collected over a three-year period on about 1300 rhesus macaques housed in 13 1/2-acre enclosures. Data also were analyzed on management factors such as age/sex composition and matriline configuration that might promote aggression. Using negative binomial regression [alpha=0.05], results indicate that network measures such as subordination-degree (rate and diversity of subordination), displacement fragmentation (connectivity among dominance relationships) and groom reciprocity within social groups were not only significantly associated with rates of contact aggression and wounding requiring hospitalization but with the occurrence of severe aggressive outbreaks. In addition, groups with a lower proportion of adult females and a more uniform distribution of animals across matrilines exhibited significantly higher subordination-degree and lower fragmentation. Manipulating group/matriline composition may reduce the level of aggression and aggression-based morbidity and mortality. These data suggest social network measures are valuable predictors of deleterious aggression indicating that they could be used to track changes in social dynamics to detect significant instabilities, allowing managers to prevent severe outbreaks before they occur in populations of rhesus macaques (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - [unedited] In humans and other group-living species, the biological fitness (i.e., health and breeding performance) of individuals and their psychological well-being are strongly related to the nature of the social network in which they are embedded. Thus, the characteristics of the individuals' network of social relationships and the strategies they use to manage them emerge as key determinants of their 'success' at various levels, the social, the psychological and the biological. Social relationships are inherently conflicting as incumbent social partners are engaged in a continuous process of negotiation of their roles in the relationship: partners try to minimise costs and maximise benefits. In this paper I provide an outline of our approach, which is ethologically oriented, to the study of relationship and conflict management among children (and other primates). I present an overview of the conceptual and methodological frameworks that have been developed mainly in the field of the social ethology of non-human primates. This approach involves (1) re-conceptualising the nature of aggressive conflicts, as defined by the 'relational' approach; (2) studying mechanisms, at various levels (i.e., physiological, behavioural, psychological, social, and ecological) and functions (i.e., short- and long-term effects); (3) using observational and experimental procedures (e.g., the comparison of post-conflict and matched control observations, and the manipulation of group composition in structured settings); (4) applying a structurally-based catalogue of behavioural measures to record and code social interactions; (5) relying on comparative analyses within and between species; and (6) establishing and strengthening bridgeheads with developmental, social, and cognitive psychologists. We believe that this approach to the study of relationship and conflict management among children can throw important light on the patterns and processes that regulate peer relations and interactions, some of which might be shared by non-human species, and should help in the design of education and intervention programmes aimed at teaching children (and adults) to manage their relationships constructively and their conflicts peacefully (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)

AB  - This environmental statement is in two parts: a regional analysis and a site-specific analysis of coal development in the northern Powder River basin region of Montana. The regional analysis addresses cumulative impacts of coal development in the region by 1990, with emphasis on industry proposals that now require or have recently required action by Federal and state authorities. A site-specific analysis of the proposed mining and reclamation plan for the Pearl mine makes up volumes 2 and 4 of this FES. Total annual coal production from the designated region of southeastern Montana is estimated at about 39 million tons by 1980, 50 million tons by 1985, and 53 million tons by 1990. The Big Sky, Pearl, and Spring Creek mines would collectively produce approximately 15% of the total by 1980, 26.5% by 1985, and 25% by 1990. Three impacts were determined to be locally significant. The National Ambient Air Quality Standards for total suspended particulates would frequently be exceeded near all three minesites during mine life. Degradation of air quality would cause subtle injury to vegetation within about 1 mile of the mines and about 4 miles of the generating units, slightly reducing vegetative productivity. Wildlife populations, primarily antelope, mule deer, and sage grouse, would be significantly reduced during mine life and probably for several decades after mining. No threatened or endangered species would be adversely affected.Social impacts would be significant in Colstrip and Forsyth - comparable to those experienced during the construction of Colstrip units 1 and 2. At least during the 2 or 3 years of most rapid growth, local governments, formal and informal institutions, and social networks in Colstrip and Forsyth would not be able to meet the demands placed on them.

AB  - We present a model of the population dynamics of colonially breeding waterbirds, such as cormorants, herons, and egrets, in multiple-colony systems. We want to understand why a the populations fluctuate often dramatically, with frequent extinctions and recolonizations, and b there appear to be 'empty' nesting sites. Our model reproduces these characteristics while invoking only intersite dispersal, the birds' desire to aggregate, and a simple, global limit on the number of nesting pairs imposed by limited food resources. In light of this, we emphasize the importance of managing such systems as dynamic and connected, and caution against interpreting dramatic population changes on particular islands as prima facie evidence of rapid changes in local habitat quality, predation pressure, or disturbance. Nor should currently unoccupied sites - or large areas, such as the NJ Meadowlands - be 'written off.' Finally, we discuss how our model may be tested, and the implications for future research and monitoring efforts (Copyright applies to all Abstracts.)
