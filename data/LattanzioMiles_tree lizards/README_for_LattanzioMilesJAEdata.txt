Tab 1: 'morph_networks'
Contains data for morphology, body condition, parasite load, bite mark, perch use frequency, network construction (lat, long data) and analysis (degree, eigenvector centrality data), and morph frequency analyses. 

Tab 2: 'contests'
Contains data for multivariate analysis of variance of male social contest behaviors. 

Tab 3: 'strength_data'
contains data for analysis of strength and mean strength of edges in each sites' spatial network. 

Tabs 4-6: 'NBdiet' - 'HBdiet'
Each contain site-specific diet (trophic position) and microhabitat use (perch type) data for analyses comparing tree lizard colour morph differences in ecology.
