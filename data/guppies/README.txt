Please note that individual identification in the “Individual Level Data” file differs from that used in the focal follows and association networks.
For example, individuals L17 and H123 in the “Individual Level Data” file are individual 7 in LowRisk group 1 and individual 3 in HighRisk group 12 respectively.
In contrast, in the data files for the focal follows and association networks, individuals within each group are simply labeled by a number ranging from 1 to 8.
One individual in groups LowRisk 2, LowRisk 16, HighRisk 8, and HighRisk 13 died during the familiarization period.
The focal follow data for each group is arranged in blocks of three, with each block made up of 24 observations for each focal individual taken at 10 second intervals.
For each observation, a number means that that individual was recorded as the focal individual’s nearest neighbor, while X’s mean that the focal individual was alone—i.e., no group members were within four body lengths.

Within the “Individual Level Data” file, each group and individual is given a unique identifier.
RiskTreatment indicates whether a group was exposed to high background predation risk (HighRisk) or low background predation risk (LowRisk) during the final four days of the familiarization period (see main text for details).
The experiment was conducted in four blocks, A–D, each of which represented a cohort of 8 groups.
Length_cm provides the standard length of each individual in centimeters.
Approached and Solved indicate respectively whether an individual approached to within 2 cm of the foraging task and whether it entered the foraging device.
ApproachLatency and SolveLatency indicate respectively when during the trial an individual first approached or solved the foraging task (maximum possible latency = 1200); for those individuals who failed to approach or solve the task, the respective entry is left blank.
TimesEntered provides the number of times an individual entered the foraging device during the trial.

Association networks were constructed from the total number of distinct contact phases shared between each pair of group members.
Individual identifiers are given in the first row and column of each network and each network is symmetrical.

In the “Assortativity Coefficients” file, the variables: “GroupID”, “RiskTreatment”, and “Block” are interpreted as described above for the “Individual Level Data” file.
r^w_BodyLength provides the assortativity coefficient with regards to body length for a group’s association network.
